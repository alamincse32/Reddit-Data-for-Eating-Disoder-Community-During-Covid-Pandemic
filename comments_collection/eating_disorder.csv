You’re not alone &lt;3 I’ve been going through a similar time right now, and it sucks because after trying so hard to recover for a good few months, it feels like the ED voice came back with a vengeance but my body’s just not doing what I want it to. Idk if that makes any sense. I know you said you want to push on, but if you have someone (family, s/o, therapist, friend) who knows about your ED, I strongly recommend talking to them. Even though you desperately want to hide it and crave the security of slipping back into old habits. Vocalizing your feelings and knowing that somebody will be looking out for you (and can even validate you in terms of helping you see how you really look) can be so powerful in giving you back some agency. 

That being said, I know that sometimes turning back towards recovery is hell. If you need someone to vent to (especially someone who can’t judge you personally or hold you accountable or whatever), please feel free to message me.

It's extra hard when it feels like the only reason I'm at a healthy weight is because of my eating disorder.*

Wow, I am right there with you. I've been hovering at a borderline healthy weight, and I feel like my disordered behaviors are the only reason I'm there. I definitely agree that it's hard, especially since a little voice is convincing you that you only look good because of the disorder, but that's not true (and I'm trying to remind myself of that). I also try to remember that my body *needs* food, and that any disordered thought is just that: disordered. Gaining weight doesn't equate to a bad body, either, even though it may feel like it! 

Like someone else said, I'd definitely recommend talking to a family member, friend, or calling a previous therapist. Just having someone know what you're dealing with can be so reassuring. I know you said you've only wanted avocado toast, but maybe try and find some other recipes that sound good - if it's avocado you're craving, find some others that use it as an ingredient! I've found that I'm a lot more willing to eat if I enjoy cooking the meal.

Anyway, it's good that you know these feelings will calm down in the future. Until then, I'm definitely supporting you and empathizing. ♥",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In truth, not a single person is the epitome of normal eating--everyone binges sometimes, eats too little sometimes, has unhealthy thoughts or assumptions about food sometimes. The major point is whether those behaviors cause you mental/emotional distress, or affect your health.

I have had an ED for many, many years now. Contrary to most people, I choose to consider myself as always having an ED--even when it is dormant--rather than flip-flopping between ""recovery"" and ""relapse"". This help me, personally, to moderate those in-between times when my thoughts or behaviors may not be 100% healthy, but are also not so distressing to me as to feel that I'm spiraling downward indefinitely.

Point being, it's all up to you--if you feel these thoughts are precursors to more unhealthy behaviors, or if they are upsetting you constantly, then it's worth confronting them and figuring out how to move forward. If you don't feel that your overall health is suffering, and if you feel generally ok with where you're at, then it's also ok to just shrug and let it be.

No one is perfect--in the same way that you can't sustain a life suffering from an ED, you also can't spend your life trying to attain a pristine level of ""normal"" that doesn't exist. Find YOUR normal.",AndyF1069,1531589910.0,2018-07-14 12:38:30,"I was never officially diagnosed either, although there's absolutely zero doubt that I definitely had a disorder. I've spent the last ten years telling people about how I ""used to have"" an eating disorder when talking about certain behavioural things I do. I can't cope without my behaviours as they help me feel safe. Things like dressing a certain way or positioning my body or objects close to me in a certain way. 

My mental health has plummeted over the past 18 months after a mix of multiple deaths, a case of homelessness and a couple of family tragedies not related to the deaths . When I got a place of my own, I registered with the local doctors and have been completely open with all of my anxieties and concerns. She believes I may still have an eating disorder and I've been referred to an eating disorder clinic, but I don't know how long that'll take. I had to consent to it, and it wasn't an instant yes for me. The idea of challenging my own behaviours is a scary one. The idea of not having my safety actions or being pushed into body acceptance is a scary thing, because my brain is conditioned to believe that those things are bad. And logically I can accept that I'll likely be better once these behaviours are challenged, but it's the fear leading up to it that sucks. 

I think most people will have some sort of concern at some point over food. Did I order too much fast food? Should I be having this second helping of cake? That's a lot of beer. And the reverse is true for people trying to be health conscious as far as restricting themselves. 

But I don't believe that people obsess the way that those us of us with poor mental health or conditions obsess, nor do I believe that it restricts their lifestyle or further deteriorates mental health. I spent all of June restricting what I ate. I'd try my damndest to stay under a certain amount of calories (with exceptions for being with friends or family). I wouldn't allow myself any snacks or my favourite comfort foods. I made sure to not buy them just to make sure that I wouldn't give in to temptation. To me, that's me being ""good"" as far as reaching my goals. People with similar concerns might think I did good too. But I think most people would be taken aback and feel it wasn't necessary to restrict so much. And on the flipside, in the past week I've had fast food three times (twice with friends), including last night. Last night was an intense desire with nothing to do with hunger. And I've spent all of today regretting it, and haven't eaten yet (it's 6.30pm) but I will cook myself a meal soon. 

Emotionally, I feel as if I'm trying to take control. Logically, I know that it's unhealthy to restrict and to obsess. That's why I consented to be referred to the eating disorder clinic. As much as I fear it, I would like to get better. It would be nice to leave the house in summer in just a shirt (I literally can't right now).

",AndyF1069,1531588678.0,2018-07-14 12:17:58,"Logically, people aren't thinking about your insecurities when they compliment you unless you've brought it to their attention a lot of times. They just comment on what's in front of them. You might be thinking you are huge, but if you aren't telling people that, then they aren't thinking it and can't be trying to please you. 

It sounds like you have body dysmorphia, which is very common in people with eating disorders. I suffer from it myself and I relate a lot to your self perception and not being able to take on board what other people say. I'm terrified of scales and I won't weigh myself. I also feel huge. My dysmorphia prevents me from putting objective eyes on myself.

I feel like they’re trying to compliment me (even though they’re saying it with concern). I still don’t believe I’ve ever been thin, I wish I was but I just never see it. It drives me crazy to think about, too. So it’s better when I don’t. I just have to remind myself it doesn’t matter either way as long as I’m healthy. (Even though ED voice often translates the word “healthy” to mean “fat”.) ",lizefb,1531626349.0,2018-07-14 22:45:49,"I agree with the other replies. 

Most people who have or have had an eating disorder struggle with either body dysmorphia or some kind of distorted body image. There's a very real disturbance in the brain of those with either anorexia or body dysmorphia that affects the ability to process visual accurately, especially information that pertains to the body and the self.  There's also the emotional component that can be a distraction, something to focus on when stress levels rise. 

I've had to work on reminding myself that what I see isn't accurate. It's not easy, but I'm fortunate to have a lot of support from friends and family who avoid negative comments. Still, people often say things without thinking or realizing that the comment might be taken the wrong way. I've had people tell me I'm ""meaty"" or ""robust"" and it still makes me feel weird. It's so important to realize that comments like those are usually meant as a compliment. Those that are not can be hurtful, but you just have to do your best to ignore them and know that it's a reflection of the person saying them, not you. That's a little bit off topic, but it has been on my mind a lot lately. 

As far as treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy seems to work well for a lot of people. A few medications that are in the sri category have also been found to be helpful.  The fact that you are aware is a good sign. It's possible you can just keep working on things yourself or with a therapist or group to resolve any possible lingering issues. You're not alone, though, and you're not at all crazy. I think there are quite a few of us in a similar boat out there!

How can I be thin then (but think I don't look it) but be heavier now but ""look"" the same as I did when I was thin?

15,8x5dyq,galacticshock,1531125393.0,2018-07-09 03:36:33,"So you’ve identified there are some big issues going on, which is a really good first step. But I also understand you want some tools that will help you manage the time critical event of your wedding. 

So first thing first, congratulations on your wedding! They are extremely stressful in the lead up, but it’s a party that keeps on giving with a wonderful marriage. I wish you and your partner a very happy life together, filled with joy. 

Secondly the few little suggestions I’ll give are just my personal experience and things that can give moments of relief from anxiety. There is still a need for you to seek professional help, and I hope you can do that even once before your wedding. 

I recommend two basic steps:
Mindfulness and breathing techniques: there are apps to guide you through breathing. Every 20 minutes take 5 slow breaths focusing on your diaphragm. 

Basic affirmation on your wedding day: this is your day and yes you will be the centre of attention at times but it’s an attention that wants the absolute best for you and are there because they love you.  Tell yourself, out loud, “these people love me and support me. I am glad they are with me on this special day” 

I’m going to qualify all this with you are only the centre of attention at times...a lot of the times guest will be talking and dining amongst themselves, about themselves. They’ll have their moments talking about the ceremony but I’ve been to at least 20 weddings in the last 5 years as a general attendee and I’d say that I spent no more than the ceremony, the initial photos after, the speech, the first dance, cake cutting talking about the bride and the day in general. These events go for hours, people talk and focus on other things.  I loved them all but at the end of the day, we spoke about all sorts of things over dinner and at other times. I know that sounds cynical but sometimes we easily magnify the issues that stress us and it can help to remove that focus. 

",rr88trod,1531151502.0,2018-07-09 10:51:42,"Hey. I know this isn’t much, but I’ve had EDs for most of my life and I just want you to know you look way more beautiful than you feel. I wish I had more to say but perhaps because I know how hard it can feel, I just don’t know what else to say. I promise you you’re more beautiful than you think and that you will be a stunning bride. I suggest you write down ONLY positive affirmations about this wedding and looks-related insecurities in specific in a notebook. Buy a notebook only for this maybe. What I do is I write down things I want to feel, reaffirming that I do feel them. Last I wrote “I am a beautiful, beautiful girl and I realize the voices in my head are made up.” It’s almost like shaking awake your real self and writing letters to it instead of living with your ED. One tip there: if you can’t think of something positive to write, dont write in that notebook. That notebook would not be a catharsis, but a way to realize who you are. Close your eyes somewhere during the wedding and just feel the love of having someone who wants to be with you for life. Try to think a bit beyond your monsters. It’s hard but I promise it’s possible. Also, if your ED is severe and you have at least 2-3 weeks for your wedding, have you considered going to a psychiatrist? I’m on Zoloft 25mg (lowest dose) and it really helps, though it only makes you realize things you can realize yourself too. 

Have the most amazing time. Congratulations. ",brirock8121,1531285509.0,2018-07-11 00:05:09,"Hugs, friend. I so feel you. There is no easy answer to this. When I feel body obsessed, I ask myself who I can help. In the context of your wedding day, that can seem weird since it's supposed to be YOUR day. But it also belongs to your partner. Ask yourself how you can make this day special for them every time you feel yourself getting down about your body. Everyone will think you are beautiful, btw. Don't let those negative voices ruin your special day. 

Btw, I've been recovered from compulsive eating for 6 years and am a recovered available sponsor in a program that has saved my life. DM me anytime to talk about it.

If your therapist says ""no"" then find a new therapist. It's possible that your therapist thinks LABELING your food difficulties is ""not an issue"" (in other words, trying to slot you into a category such as anorexia or ARFID). But if your therapist truly thinks that gagging on food and losing weight is ""not an issue"", then find a new therapist!

To be honest it sounds like you don’t really want to gain weight. You know how to, you gained 5kg before, which is quite significant and you could have continued. If you want to continue eating the same volume, just eat more calorie dense foods.

",infpetal,1532950181.0,2018-07-30 06:29:41,"I eat small portions too. If I eat a normal sized meal it takes days for my appetite to come back properly.

What I've done to gain weight is find what portion feels best and how long it takes to digest. For me, I feel best with a 500 calorie meal and it's usually 3 hours before I'm hungry again.

So all I really think about is having 4 meals a day of 500 calories (I gain weight with 2000 calories) and I've gained 15 pounds so far.

It feels like I'm eating small meals all day, like I'm not eating much, so my appetite seems constantly active. But overall, the calories add up and I gain.

Another part is that I'm a night owl and I feel much better having my meals match that rhythm. I eat roughly 12pm, 3pm, 6pm, 9pm. I don't pressure myself to have an appetite in the morning, but sometimes I do and eat a meal early. I'm overall flexible with the times.

So this system of small portions, the same calories every meal, roughly the same times of day, makes it easier to not think about how to gain weight and my body gets more and more used to the rhythm. When it's a mealtime, it's more like 'I just need 500 calories of anything' rather than figure out an exciting meal. Like you, I eat because I have to. It helps to have these simple guidelines that feel physically comfortable and require not much work on my part to gain weight other than add foods up to 500 and eat the smallish meal.

Hope this sparks some ideas for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought that starving was dulling my emotions and making me feel better but that was actually making the problem worse. Anxiety symptoms increase above and below a healthy BMI (there is a lot of debate over what those numbers are for each individual, but a professional can help you decide what’s right for you). 

After suffering from OCD during my lowest weight times, I completely understand how you’re feeling. I, too, enjoyed the feeling of running on empty. Starvation put me in a haze that felt better than the alternative: when I was at a low BMI, any food put into my system allowed me to think more clearly, yes, but i was still not experiencing healthy brain functioning so that’s why the anxiety seemed much worse with food. 

However, over the course of recovery I have realized that once I finally got to a “healthy” BMI, anxiety was much easier to manage and most of my OCD symptoms went away. I recently had a dip in my BMI due to stress and all the symptoms came roaring back. Ideally I’d like to be even a little higher than the weight when most of the symptoms went away because then I have some wiggle room if I get stressed and lose a few pounds because I’ll still be able to manage the stress without the OCD coming back to throw a wrench into everything and make me lose even more. 

The takeaway here is that the low BMI is causing many of your anxiety symptoms and starving is making it worse. I am desperately trying to return to a healthier BMI to relieve my own OCD symptoms because I have experienced the relief so recently that I know it truly works. That’s the last thing you might want to read but I speak from experience and I would not lie.

When you starve yourself, do you think a lot about it? If so, it might be that your thoughts are no longer focused on this continious/calming(?) activity but instead racing and anxious?

Or maybe your stomach is stressed when it deals with food (because of your behaviour in the past) and then sends the ""stressed-signal"" to the brain.

I once also starved myself to make my anxiety less severe, but then I noticed when I just avoided corn and instead consumed more fat the same effect happened.

Eating only based on hunger cues often doesn't give your body what it needs  from a nutrition standpoint, things like vitamins, minerals and various fats.  

If your energy is being affected by the small about you're eating, it sounds like you definitely need to keep an eye on things. One can so quickly fall down that slippery slope of consistently not eating enough. 

Seeing a therapist to help sort things out is never a bad idea. Sometimes just talking things through will give you a better idea of what you need. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What helped me when I was taking similar medications and having similar thoughts but finally deciding I wanted to eat was eating just a little something while distracted. If I was distracted by friends or something else I could usually trick myself into eating just a bit and that would usually make it easier to eat more later. The hardest part was the first bit. 

Then once I finally broke the fast, it was helpful to have a schedule for eating. For example, I wouldn’t wait to get hungry (since I never would) but I would always eat a little something for lunch by 1 o clock. I feel like it gets harder to eat the longer you go without doing it.

The BMI is not an accurate measure of what every person's weight should be--there are a myriad of factors that it does not take into consideration. 

It can be very difficult to find a therapist. Please don't internalize this--I don't think it's about their willingness to help you. Just keep looking and trying.

Although, your mom’s preoccupation with your weight can’t have been healthy and I can see how that would lead to a weird relationship with your body.",hellomireaux,1531788819.0,2018-07-16 19:53:39,"I'm sorry you grew up with the family focus on your body.  I'm sorry you spent 9 years running in an effort to make your body fit their expectations.  It sounds like there's a lot of shame and disordered thoughts about the role of food and exercise in your life.  It's an exhausting way to live.  I think it makes total sense that you're struggling against your body after trying to make it fit into this narrow box of ""acceptable"".  

I know how disheartening it can be to make the effort to help yourself and get shot down.  The lack of available therapists says more about the fact that you're not alone in needing help than whether or not you're deserving of help.  Please don't assume it's because you aren't ""sick enough"".  If the bus is full, it can't stop to pick up the next person, even if they're late to work and have an important presentation that day.  (I apologize for the cheesy comparison, that's just how I think.) 

Anyway, I guess my point is that I hope you make one, two or ten more calls - whatever it takes to get the support you need.  Life with those oppressive, nagging thoughts is definitely not as great as the life you could have.  Sometimes it's easy to say, ""If my body was  XYZ, I'd be happy.""

If your concerns are interfering with your life or badly affecting your self image, it can definitely be a sign of an eating disorder. A therapist might be able to answer where along the spectrum you fall, though. 

I'm sorry you are feeling frustrated. Working with a nutritionist can be good as long as it's someone who is compassionate and understands the emotional aspect people deal with when it comes to eating issues. 

Try not to be hard on yourself. You might look into the body positive movement and HAES movement. It's great that you want to be healthy, but being healthy is something you can help define in your own mind. Too many rules can often backfire, so be sure not to restrict or punish yourself while trying to improve your habits. Make sure whatever you are doing, you do it for yourself and that you feel good as much as possible every step of the way. It's also important to try to figure out what a healthy weight is for you, and make sure you're not aiming for something that's unrealistic or not sustainable. 

Keep working on trying to get in to see a therapist, or maybe consider finding a support group if you feel that might provide you with some guidance. It can be so helpful to just have someone act as a sounding board. 

It looks like you already got some great responses. I just hope that you can do what it takes to feel better about yourself, whatever you decide to do with your diet and exercise regimen.

For a guy your age you should never really drop below consuming 1500 calories a day or you are risking serious, permanent damage to your metabolism. And that isn't an average of 1500 calories a day. I mean you should eat at least 1500 every single day. You could maybe get away with 1200 but still, I wouldn't push it. Losing around 1-2 pounds per week is considered healthy. Maybe see a nutritionist too?

Fasting is not a healthy way to lose weight, especially over the course of more than a day. Water, especially, is critical to the body and necessary for proper functioning.

As someone who has had similar frightening health episodes, I would say that this likely would have been your body telling you that you need to eat. This may be my personal opinion, but I truly believe it. 

As someone with an eating disorder and trying to be an advocate for those with ED, I would encourage you to meet with a dietitian, and possibly more importantly, a therapist. Counseling and therapy do wonders. Find someone who works best with you and your needs. Don't stop until you find the right fit. Find someone who validates your concerns. Self-esteem is a tricky situation.

I also would like to encourage you to read Eva Musby's book. It is a good way of looking at yourself with compassion, as well as using self-esteem tools.",Cae22,1531710804.0,2018-07-15 22:13:24,"I used to binge a lot. I would go all day without eating and then have a huge meal at night...
I personally don't think what you're doing is healthy. Yes, fasting is a thing, but not as a permanent lifestyle. How I look at it is not how I'm looking on the outside (of course I like myself to be ""skinnier"", that's why I dealt with disordered eating for so long), but I think about what's happening on the inside to my organs and bones. Think about your blood cells and immune system.
Also, think of your body like a car. If you don't give a car gas, it can't go. If you don't give yourself food, you can't go. With regular exercise (even if It's just cleaning the house or something) and at least 2000-2500 calories a day, while focusing on carbohydrates and protein, you can absolutely have a great, healthy body you want! You'll feel a lot better too!

I’m a 27-yo guy and I know I’m not actually fat or overweight by any standards but I have body dysmorphia. I’ve been doing intermittent fasting for about a month now and although I really like it and the benefits I’m feeling (esp when it comes to energy levels) I can see where it can get off the rails for those of us who are predisposed to disordered eating.

I won’t tell you to stop fasting...after all it does have lots of health benefits besides weight loss and for me personally it’s a way to feel control over eating while not being restrictive about what I eat.

However, you absolutely NEED to drink lots of water while you’re fasting! And take electrolytes! Honestly if you start feeling dizzy, heart palpitations etc it’s 99.9% likely to be either dehydration or lack of electrolytes. And of course I agree with the other commenters that if your body is telling you to eat, do it!!

It’s not really beneficial to fast for periods longer than 36 hours, so you notice yourself regularly slipping into a pattern of longer and longer fasts you might want to consider something else.",yellowposy2,1531848049.0,2018-07-17 12:20:49,"I saw another comment that said fasting is good, and I understand there are health benefits.

I would recommend meeting with a therapist with eating disorder experience or with a dietician to discuss what healthy eating looks like. Honestly, eating regular meals and following a meal plan is really helpful to me because it makes me still feel in control and I know that it’s dietician-approved, and after my initial weight gain in treatment (I was underweight for my body type) I have maintained a steady weight.

In reality, many people find that their body has a natural set point and they don’t continue to gain and gain and gain. Your body needs nourishment to function.

My only suggestion is to try to eat some small meals or snacks throughout the day to increase appetite and hunger cues, since loss of appetite and ignoring the hunger for so long are not uncommon within ED sufferers. If you work, study, or are generally outside of the house all day, bring something small with you, it doesn't have to be something elaborated and gourmet, maybe nuts, chocolate, something small and easily portable that you enjoy, and eat something every 3-4 hours. I've been using this method for a month now and I've noticed an increase in both appetite and hunger, though my stomach is still tiny and hurts sometimes. Ha.

The more you practice eating the more normal it will feel and the nausea will subside. I find that hunger registers as nausea to my brain. I think this is called dyspepsia or is a form of it.

You want to make a massive effort with this as it will improve your physical symptoms that you've mentioned and feed your brain to be productive and feel good. Starting with 3 small manageable meals and proceed from there to include 3 snacks too. 

Caffeine suppresses appetite so try and eat before coffee or reduce your intake. Caffeine can also cause nausea if the stomach is empty and make you even less willing to eat. Play around and experiment with comfort foods and easy palatable meals, even smoothies with nut butter, protein powder, fruit, veg, to get a full meal worth of nutrients when you're struggling to eat solids. You can even make a creamy coffee smoothie so it's really two birds with one stone. ",PlainJane_xx,1532295905.0,2018-07-22 16:45:05,"Are you drinking enough water daily? If not start with that.

Pick up some meal supplement shakes- they will help you adjust to the feeling of a full tummy without overwhelming your body. Smoothies are good too as long as they aren’t loaded with sugar.

As far as full meals go- no one wants to eat alone and I know, I’ve been there before. Start by inviting friends or family out for a meal or ask for someone to teach you how to cook their best recipe. It’s easier to eat when your happy &amp; not alone.

Don’t skip an entire meal because you don’t think you’ll finish the plate. Eat what you can and save the rest for your next meal. Smaller portions are much less intimidating. Just eat what you can &amp; don’t be too hard on yourself- rebuilding an appetite takes time.

It doesn't matter what amount of calories other men claim to subsist on, especially given that I wouldn't trust most people's word on how much they're eating on random internet forums. If you're hungry, it's because you need to be eating more than you are currently eating. Imo weighing your food and tracking your calories is a really mentally unhealthy approach to food. If you feel like reading a book would help you, I'd suggest The Diet Survivor's Handbook (though it's mostly aimed at women, which might be annoying for you). It was really helpful for me back when I felt like I had to count calories/fast/control my eating or else I would gain weight.",The_greeen_faerie,1533394063.0,2018-08-04 09:47:43,"okay. take a step back and breathe for a hot second. you are not well. so let's stop comparing to athletes and body builder types for a while. that's not helpful here. you are complex, you have hormones to consider, a warped relationship with your body to consider, years of self-abuse to consider and heal, a less than helpful relationship with food to heal. 

let's start with trying to cut down comparisons with others. you are unique, so is everyone. no two people will subsist on the exact same diet and lifestyle and feel/behave/function the same. your hunger and satiety cues are yours, no-one elses. think about your personal needs, your biologial needs. 3 meals a day will help you feel full and satisfied without having one huuuge meal and feeling stuffed. you probably want to graduate towards this, not overnight.

secondly, for someone with an eating disorder, intermittent fasting is a recipe for disaster, as are all 'diets' even if they're recommended by fitness fanatics and work for some people. these people are the exception, not the rule. we need to ignore them, especially when an eating disorder is part of the equation.

your body has been under stress for a long long time so yes, it wants to store energy as fat.. to survive. you wont be able to tell from what you look like/how much fat you have etc, how much damage has really be done to your body under the surface. years of restriction takes it toll, your body is yelling to you to eat more and more frequently and consistently.

before you move on (if you still want to do this in the future) to finding a certain body type (which i dont suggest will ever be a good idea considering your history and present state), you need to prioritise healing your body and mind. this should be your priority at all costs, nothing else. until this is repaired, you're going to struggle with your issues mentioned above. 

body positivity is becoming a huge movement and is so so helpful for people of all walks of life, all body types, all identities. i really suggest you investigate some body positive blogs/forums/meet ups and also i urge you to find professional help. psychiatrist, nutritionist, psychotherapist, life coach, whatever is affordable. 'shop' around until you find a support network that understands and suits you. 

also, calorie counting is never going to find you happiness. it's going to impoverish your life in all cases. these behaviours have not brought you happiness in the past so think about some positive behaviours you can use to replace the negative ones and really reach out for help.",proxyPhoenix,1533403230.0,2018-08-04 12:20:30,"As a fellow transman let me tell you that gaining weight on T just changes your fat distribution.

&gt;As someone who has been in IP treatment numerous times, something I found really helpful was a bouncy ball. I used to bounce it on the floor, on the wall in my room or just squeeze it hard. I had a few and I'd juggle with them too. There was also a few times where I'd play catch with it with the other patients and the nurses (yes this was on an adult ward...)

In addition to what you already have (all great btw), depending on your partner's personality, things like jigsaws (I hated these but other patients found them soothing), the game bananagrams, music of some sort, nail polish, slippers, photographs of things that will motivate them, Lego, clay, nice smelling shower gel / shampoo, fidget toys (spinner, cube etc), a diary (I recommend looking up Q&amp;A a day journal), books of short stories/poetry, fairy lights, dvds...

Again, this is dependant on personality / sense of humour but a box or jar of personalised notes that you have written that they can take one of out each day. Funny/motivational/loving... So I'd find stupid things like ""FFS it's just cheese, it won't kill ya"" or ""stop being a tit so I can see you again. Miss ya"" or ""mmmm just think of the donuts"" helpful but these could be super triggering for other people so you may want to go more for more loving and encouraging words. It's entirely dependent on what your partner is like. I have a morbid sense of humour and find it helpful to laugh at myself but this can have the opposite effect on others.

Sending you and your partner lots of well wishes. Hope this helps in some way.",penguinPS,1532882832.0,2018-07-29 11:47:12,"I’ve been in IP many times. Here are a few ideas!

My partner was as supportive as he could be with me through out my recovery. But it wasn't easy on him either. Often times he would get angry and upset, worried for me that I wasn't eating. Especially because he could see the effects on my ED on me and it was hurting our relationship. 
It didn't make me feel better about my ED when we would become emotional about it, but it was because he cared. 

The best advice I have for your situation is to try to be understanding of the emotional toll it takes on the people around you. As hard as that can be at times, because they too find it hard to deal with an issue they may not understand or find taxing. It sounds like your partner really does care to support you through this tough time. 

On feeling like you don't belong in recovery.. do not give up on it. The other patients may not understand your individual situation, and they'll be experiencing emotional turmoil of their own, which often makes people do irrational things and become emotionally volatile. However, you need and deserve the support you're getting. Regardless of how the other patients make you feel you do belong there. You may not find support amongst the other patients but you should receive support from qualified people who are there to help. Don't give up on your recovery because of this.

Yes you want her to be healthy but that means achieving recovery, or at least starting recovery. That doesn't necessarily mean going to the gym to punish herself more than she already does. It means building a positive relationship with her body and mind. A positive relationship with food and activity. Going to the gym and loosing weight isn't going to achieve these goals, it's going to most likely force an unhealthy relationship with exercise. Try and encourage her to seek therapeutic help for EDNOS/BED, a nutritionist, and a psychiatrist to get a full team to get on board with her recovery. You will also need to psycho-educate yourself about eating disorders so as not to collude with her illness. ",oldpaintunderthenew,1532863652.0,2018-07-29 06:27:32,Yes thank you.

You want to encourage a healthy relationship with food, activity and most importantly, herself - body and mind. To get her more active, start by suggesting going out for walks together to parks or in woods. Don't call it exercise - it's not! It's doing something fun and new and exploring with your partner... But it also gets her moving in a healthy way. The air in these natural places also gives you so much more energy that I've found at least! Also do things like get nerf guns and chase each other round your flat or in a park. Get a ball and play catch, put on some music and do some silly dance moves until she joins in. These things get her active but the most important thing they are doing? Getting her having fun. The key to break the disorder is her happiness.

Also, in terms of eating. Cook together! Experiment in the kitchen and stop buying convenience foods. You fancy chocolate chip cookies? Cool, but let's run down to the shops, pick up some ingredients and make some! How about smarties instead of chocolate chips? Should we put in marshmallows?

Stock up on a ton of veggies and make meals that you can freeze like chilli's, stews, curries. Make pizza from scratch, make your own veggie burgers. Again, it's all about having fun and enjoying the healthy changes you make.

She needs to be seeing a dietitian and therapist and working on a meal plan. Once she has that down, she can work on a trainer or getting to the gym, but I have to echo others concerns- right now it's honestly risky. Eating disorders are process disorders that almost always have an element of OCD. It's SUPER easy to recover from one just by developing another, and she could easily get the ""high"" she gets from binging by going to the gym and become a compulsive over exerciser.

Sorry to hear you are having trouble getting enjoyment from anything. I know what that is like... What does your therapist try and ask you about? They should be helping you come to understand your thought patterns so they can help you overcome them.  

With weighing yourself regularly it is difficult because the odds are always against you. Your weight doesn't change significantly unless you weigh yourself roughly every week. Your weight does fluctuate daily however, it could be due to water retention for example. Effective gravity changes twice per day so you could even weigh differently just because of where the moon is.  

The complexities of eating disorders mean that we put so much stock into how *we* think we should be, according to what society expects of us. Girls **must** be thin at all times, for example. This is a difficult code to rewrite, one that can be helped by talking to other people about. I find that when I speak to other people like me, I am reminded that the feelings I have are *not unique to me* and that they are *temporary*. Maybe seeking out a support group for people with eating disorders is something you could try? If you feel like you have the courage to tell your parents, go for it, because these problems can be very isolating and make us feel like we *cannot* share them, but sharing them can often be a solution.

Sometimes one thing that can help is to talk to people around you about what you are going through. See if you can try and tell your family members your thoughts and feelings, it might make you feel more relieved? 

It is common to feel like you don't know why you are doing some things, like it becomes normal to act a certain way and you stop thinking about why that is. One thing that you could try to think about how to challenge your behaviours is using [this exercise](https://www.get.gg/docs/ACTworksheet.pdf). An example of how to do this could be like this:  

Imagine one day you feel you have to throw up, and you throw up some food. In the first column ""A Activating Event"" it asks you to think about the situation that caused it - it could be you were in a certain place, or doing a certain thing, maybe with certain people? Then in column B ""Believable Thoughts"" you have to write down what you were thinking at the time, an example could be ""I need to puke because I have too many calories"" or ""I need to puke or else I will gain weight"". In column C ""Consequences of believing the thought"" you have to pick your most severe thought from B, and describe the consequences as you believe them. For example ""I believe I will gain weight, this is bad because I must be thin"". You can choose to write a ""Balanced thought"" too, which could be ""I am already thin, so I do not need to puke"". Next you fill in ""Consequences of not believing the thought"" - so what happens if you choose to NOT believe ""I need to puke or I will gain weight""? What happens if you reject this thought as not true?  

D is for ""De-fuse"" and it is to try and find an exercise to break apart difficult thoughts and realise that they are not true and are only temporary. This is just one way to try and practice challenging difficult thoughts and trying to question if they are true or not. I have done it before and found it is helpful, because most of the time I cannot find any good reason to have a negative thought, and because I prove that the thought is not true, I can let it go. I hope you had a good weekend and were able to do something nice for yourself :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel like that it would be best to make sure you're in a supported environment with the right level of care if you're trying to maintain a healthy weight. It might be helpful to talk to your doctor about strategies you can put in place, and possibly a dietician you can work with to create a meal plan. 

Gentle or light exercise may be a way to assist in gaining health in a way that is not 100% focussed on calories or food. Creating goals with measurable outcomes and timelines that are not focussed on weight may be helpful as well! For example, I want to be able to run 2 miles in the next 3 months, or I want to lower my blood pressure by xyz points, or anything like that is better and healthier than a goal like I want to lose xyz pounds as quickly as possible.

Good luck.",Jae-the-witch,1533782098.0,2018-08-08 21:34:58,"I'm in the same boat as you, you aren't alone! 

The first step is to reevaluate your goal for a quick sec. 
You definitely don't want to start this with the goal of ""quickly"" losing weight, that alone will trigger you. Also, I'd drop the ""weight"" goal altogether in order to not retrigger. 

If you're doing this for medical reasons, the actual number on the scale likely won't tell you much about your health progress, and could potentially set you back health wise. 

It sounds odd, because if you have to lose weight for medical reasons of course you're like ""I need to track it somehow and make weight loss my goal"", but the wrong focus can set you up for failure. 

Here's what I've been doing 

1) no scales. I also have to shift my habits to be healthier for medical reasons, but the scale just made me want to backslide into awful habits. It may sound counterintuitive but I lost more ""weight"" when I wasn't checking the scale. My best streak was 8 months scale free! I made the most progress during that time and my health thanked me. 

2) try. TRY. To not count calories. Just pay attention to what you are fueling rather than what you are restricting. Like ""okay, this is full of stuff I need for a healthy heart, I'm gonna have plenty of this"" or ""this has plenty of protein so I can gain some muscle and strength, great!"". No lie, it feels totally unnatural for an eating disorder mind because we are so used to feeling shame about what we put in and being painfully aware of what's in it. I still count, I can't stop, but I'm trying to shift my thinking slowly and not give myself crap if I can't 

3) if you were a compulsive exercise person, try to limit your exercise to fun and rewarding activities a few times a week. I love bike riding so I try to go three times a week minimum, 5 times a week max. The important thing is that you LIKE it because if you do painful but high burning workouts it retriggers that ""punishment"" aspect of exercise and you can relapse. It happened to me anyway. 

4) constantly check yourself. Have your goals shifted back to weight focused rather than health focused? Are you pinching or measuring in any way? Has your thought process turned back to its old familiar habits? If you find this happening, forgive yourself and find some support ASAP. Remember that this is for health, not weight loss, and the two can be related but are not always correlated. While your issues may be stemming from it (since you mentioned this was medical), you can't put the focus on the number. It's misleading. Your health could be improving, but your number hasnt changes the way you want it to and it could send you into a tailspin. I've been there and done that multiple times. 

When it's between you and the scale, you will lose every single time. If you're unhappy with the number, emotions can set you back. If you're TOO happy with the number, it can set you back. 

I've had both happen to me. It's best to just do the actions you know you have to (happy exercise and good food) for health and TRUST that your insides will benefit from proper treatment no matter what the scale could possibly say. 

5) indulge a little now and then to keep your sanity. 

6) create normal achievement based goals. 
For example here are mine 
Hold a plank for 5 minutes eventually 
Bike on my new bike for 10 miles, then 15, then 20 (as long as I'm having fun) 
Be more flexible, practice stretching 
Take more evening walks because I enjoy them 
Try something new 
Go on one hike a month for the summer 

Things like that. Things I can improve without a scale. Be sure they are realistic and not too much! Have someone you trust check your goals for fairness to yourself and to make sure you aren't setting yourself up for failure, relapse, or burnout 


It's a lot of work, you pretty much have to change how you look at food and exercise entirely and that's not an easy thing to do.  Diet culture doesn't help either. You likely won't be able to befriend the typical ""weight loss buddy"" because their methods will be inherently triggering. 

If you need someone to talk to, I'd live to invite you to message me. I could always use more health buddies on this journey who are aware of eating disorders and are in the same boat as I am. 


Also, this is what worked for me. Maybe some of these won't work for you and that's okay! 

Good luck!

Over time and repeated exposure to those foods, I struggled less and became a much more adventurous eater.

Several years later, I developed anorexia during a time of high emotional stress that I didn’t have tools to deal with.  I think my years of being okay with skipping or delaying meals contributed to developing the ED.

It doesnt have to  be the same thing, but for me, it helps if it is because I have bad anxiety and always having the same thing helps me gage how I am doing. Have something filling that is high in protein, fat and fiber. Peanut butter is good. It is slow to digest and will keep you full. Cottage cheese is good because its so high in protein. The point is, you want to go to bed satisfied so you dont wake up hungry.  I also used to take klonopin at night and that helped temporarily but not in the long run. I don't recommend relying on these kinds of drugs because they loose there initial affect and then the original problem is still there.  Also your body experiences a drop in blood sugar every 3-5 hours, so you just want to try to eat at least every 5 hours to keep your blood sugar stable. Night time is hard because say you eat dinner at 6, and go to bed at 10 or 11. That is 4 to 5 hours where you haven't eaten. So then you wake up hungry.

Then there's FO (Fix Own) which means choosing anything you want. 

You'll graduate from one level to the next by meeting certain criteria. I believe the step up from Trays to IE is eating 100% for a week.  The step up to FO is much more complicated, and at my Renfrew site, involved going to ""A Stage"".

Losing weight healthy will mean you would most likely lose between 1-3 pounds a week. Allow yourself to have a treat once and a while and eat healthy.

You might try looking into the Body Positive Movement. We get bombarded with so many unhealthy messages about bodies, weight, and beauty. What's really important is to focus on your health, both your physical health and your mental health. You might even consider seeing a therapist to help you sort things out. There are also some great support groups on Facebook. You just have to find one that works for what you need.

I would voice your worries to your friend, it can do no harm to say how you’re concerned, want to be there for her and support her if she needs help. In my experience - comments on weight loss go one of two ways: either someone who’s been working hard is pleased their efforts are paying off or in the case of people with eating disorders, it makes the sufferer aware that people have noticed a change. 
When I was suffering, I was pleased when people noticed but it soon changed to me taking it as an attack and I would get very angry and defensive (I have a short fuse anyway).

Perhaps now is a time to try letting go of those fears and the perceptions of what your weight ""should"" be. For me, I don't know if I could've gotten better otherwise. Generally, our methods for determining what is overweight or under are very unreliable. I used to go by BMI, but it doesn't make sense for everyone. In fact, the BMI was not even made to determine whether a person is overweight or underweight, but we began using it for that purpose.

I think the only way is to get through that is to come to terms with the fact that, yes, you will gain weight. But what if that's ok? Like really truly ok? If we respond appropriately to our hunger, we won't be too thin or to big to live a happy, healthy life. Maybe our body has an ideal that does not align with what we've been socially programmed to think, but maybe that is what's best for us holistically--a balance between our physical and mental health.

One, in particular, deals with exactly this. It's so important not to restrict during recovery. Your body needs so much fuel and nutrition to heal, and you will eventually find balance, however you want to define that for yourself. 

Carmen Cool and the whole HAES movement are also great resources. 

You really shouldn't have to restrict in order to be at a healthy weight. Take a look at your definition of beauty and how you define it for yourself versus other people. Sometimes we are much harder on ourselves than others.

If taking time off of work is a big issue too, you could also look to having intense therapy over the year (if this is covered by the insurance) and look to start residential over the next summer. IMO, not the best route health wise because you have to go through a whole year, but it might solve the time issue you mentioned.

I would also call some of the hotlines out there- they might be able to help.

You'll get it paid off and depending on your insurance, they'll usually cover at least some of it. I've heard adults can stay inpatient for at least 6 months at a time, but I guess that depends on their insurance coverage and whether or not you want to get better and severity. Since you're struggling with bulimia, it usually takes about a month without doing anything to break the habit, that's why the stays are at least a month. Another thing to be prepared for is that sometimes treatment doesn't work and you'll have to go back several times or you'll have to find an alternative option.

Sometimes he would refuse to eat, or say he was full. Freaked me out, and I would often encourage him to eat a little more. My therapist really helped me see that I was projecting a lot of my own fears on to my brother. 

As for advice, I have a couple questions:

1. Does your brother know about your ED?
2. Have you gotten treatment for it?

If yes to the first one, you could confide in your fears to him. You may be able to work out something that assuages your fears. You said you were worried that he might become self-conscious, than I would advise mentioning what you did here, that you love him and your just scared mostly because of what you went through.

If you have a therapist, or are considering seeing some sort of treatment, you could work out some tricks to help with your anxiety and panic.

I've seen this a lot in parents who are worried that their kids may make the same mistakes they did. I think the best solution would be to just be open about it with your brother.

It is perfectly fine to count and log calories to know what you are putting into your body each day, I would say it is responsible and not doing so can lead to mysterious and distressing weight gain because of lack of documentation.
But it is clear that you shift from one extreme to the other, nowhere in your post do you mention moderation.

Guess what, “intuitive eating(LOL)” doesn’t work for a lot of people with ED and unnecessary and “mysterious” weight gain is a huge trigger, which can be prevented with calorie counting, which is just a log of energy content. Don’t come at me like I’m suggesting to go against your treatment team lol. But counting calories does work for a lot of people with disordered eating because it is a reality check. In combination with other therapy, it can be a great tool for recovery and is necessary for me.",CaptWeeble,1534883982.0,2018-08-21 15:39:42,"Sorry if I came across as hostile in my last post.  I’m glad that that is a tool that works for you in recovery.  Anyone who breaks free from this nightmare should get kudos regardless of how they do it.

I agree with your recommendation for OP to make an appointment with a professional.  Hopefully an ED dietitian and therapist can help them sort out what’s going on before they get further down the rabbit hole.

My disagreement is that I don’t think it is necessarily a wise idea to encourage someone who is struggling with obsessing over calories by saying counting calories is a fine and responsible thing to do.  Precise measurements of food and counting calories sent me into relapse several times, so I’m one of the people who has to avoid it, even now that I’ve made significant progress in recovery.  Obviously, YMMV.

It’s okay if IE doesn’t work for everyone.  It isn’t the only model of long term health.  But like I said above, meal plans can be based on portions of protein/fat/carbs or food groups rather than straight calories.  Even those portions don’t have to be strictly measured - they can be eyeballed and compared to different things visually (a thumb or a fist, etc.) if measuring the foods becomes a tool ED uses.",Lilith-Rising,1534888082.0,2018-08-21 16:48:02,"I understand your concerns. The reasoning behind my mentioning the calorie thing was bc when I was in treatment, as someone who had struggled with being obese and overweight, it REALLY TRULY didn’t work for me to constantly be told I was not allowed to count calories. And they expected intuitive eating which was the stupidest fucking thing I’ve literally ever heard of to push on someone who DOESNT HAVE PROPER HUNGER CUES BECAUSE I HAVE AN EATING DISORDER. That didn’t work for me because I overate or under ate. It’s like all they cared about was if anyone was underweight and they would absolutely not address my weight despite it causing me physical problems and intense emotional distress. They said being overweight wasn’t a problem and was society’s problem and didn’t actually have health consequences.(I left that day and never returned.) 

I felt dismissed and angry. I resent them for it, and they didn’t know what they were talking about, it’s like they were only trained in anorexia recovery and had no clue how to address other ED. 

Mindfulness and confronting reality via logging calories and being aware of how food affected my body was what aided in recovery. I get sick and tired of the assumption that getting rid of calorie counting is a blanket treatment. It’s not, and it’s necessary for a lot of people to be aware of the amount of energy they are putting in their body. I just want people to know that it can still be an option and you can still recover. I felt very hopeless when they told me I couldn’t count calories (because it was a helpful tool to log my actions) and it triggered depression and a worsening of my ED.

It seems crazy for ED treatment professionals to expect everyone to jump right into intuitive eating.  Like you, I had no hunger or appetite cues in the initial stages of recovery.  It took months of eating predetermined portions at predetermined times before hunger and appetite cues returned, and only then could I gradually transition into eating more intuitively.

There’s also far less stigma around hiring RDs with that background compared to therapists, because they’re in a role with less direct client contact. I’ve been in multiple res programs where there’s at least one dietitian with an ED past (and one was definitely present…) and many outpatient providers in my region with their IAEDP cert advertise as being recovered. If they were being excluded from those roles they’d never get the hours they needed for the cert.

@OP, people in the helping professions have a personal reason for being there. It’s frequently because they’re a wounded healer and have worked through the issues their clients are now facing. If you can keep counter transference in check and manage your own recovery, it’s likely you’ll make a wonderful, compassionate OT.

You might even consider going to an AL-ANON meeting to learn more about codependency and how you can set healthy boundaries.   


The main thing to remember is that this condition isn't about willpower, and it's not something she can control, really, until she deals with the underlying issues. She must first find out what drives the urges and then learn how to cope with what's going on using healthier behavioral strategies. She's not alone. Many people struggle with this issue.

Would it be possible for the two of you to attend a therapy session together? That might be helpful. 

Though I don't know if this is the case, she might be somewhat afraid to let go of the binging, and that's quite normal. Until she has a better understanding of everything that led to this kind of behavior, she will probably feel threatened every time she's faced with a lot of advice and direction from others. It's difficult to be patient when someone's health, both mental and physical, are at risk, but forcing her isn't the solution. 

Whatever conversations you have with her, approach the situation non-judgmentally but honestly. You can let her know how you're feeling without blaming her or making her feel ashamed. 

It sounds like you are doing a really good job of being kind. Just make sure you are taking care of yourself though all of this, too.

In the end I think it would make it worse because thinking of him when I’m struggling really does help, and although I don’t struggle as often (just broke a 90 day clean streak 😔) it does still weigh on me.
In the end you need to do what is best for you. If this relationship isn’t what’s best for you, you don’t owe your partner anything. You both chose to enter the relationship and one may choose to leave if it no longer meets your needs. 
I would suggest couples therapy, not really for the relationship but so you can get an insight into what kind of therapy helps her or what her therapist encourages her to do in times of stress/ struggle and you can be a support role if you continue to want to be.
Bless you for loving her, part of my eating disorder stems from feeling unwanted and I’m sure having someone love and care for her enough to reach out to Reddit for advice on how to be there for her in a better way really does mean the world to her.

Ask A Manager has handled [a similar question](https://www.askamanager.org/2014/03/my-assistant-keeps-commenting-on-my-appearance-i-seem-too-shy-in-interviews-and-more.html), about someone’s assistant commenting on her appearance, and this was her advice:

&gt; Be direct and straightforward. The next time she makes one of these comments, say, “Jane, I appreciate your concern, but I’d rather not discuss my appearance. Thank you!” If it continues after that, you can either continue repeat that as needed, or you can talk to her privately about the pattern. If you do the latter, I’d say something like, “I really appreciate how much easier you make my job. There’s something I’ve noticed, though, that you might not realize you’re doing. You’ve been commenting a lot on my appearance lately. I know it comes from a kind place, but I’d rather not discuss my appearance (or my diet) at work. I’m not comfortable with it, and I’d like to keep the focus on my work.”

Your coworkers are being really inappropriate, and even if you didn’t have a medical condition, they’d be out of line for saying these things. ",krzysztof_garon,1535687689.0,2018-08-30 22:54:49,I would start off by talking to one or two of your coworkers who seem understanding people. And say some something like the other commenters mentioned. They probably aren't really aware that it bothers you that much and might feel bad about it once you tell them. Then ideally they will begin to tell the others to cut it out. I wouldn't go directly to HR unless it's just for advice. Try to work this out directly then if all else fails see what HR can do. Good luck!,hellomireaux,1535703311.0,2018-08-31 03:15:11,"You don't owe anyone an explanation.  Gossip is highly contagious in the workplace, so telling one person can be the equivalent of announcing it over the loudspeaker.  Even if you leave it at ""I'm recovering from a medical condition"", people will fill in the blanks for themselves.  A good supervisor would think twice about putting the added stress of more job responsibility or a promotion on someone who shared this information.    

As you said, you're not stupid.  But it can be extremely uncomfortable to be in your position.  When I was in a similar situation, I went to my HR contact and simply said that my coworker's comments about my appearance made me uncomfortable (with something along the lines of ""I would rather have the focus be on my contributions to the team instead of my body"").  They addressed the individual and made an announcement at the next meeting.  That helped curb the comments from other people as well.  Going to the HR rep with specific examples can help convey your message.  

After all that, I want to just note that these types of comments and jokes are often code for ""I'm concerned about you.""  While it doesn't make them any easier to hear, it can explain why some people tend to do it repeatedly.  They might be a little uncomfortable too.

I didn't over emphasize food, just worked with her on how food and your body need each other, but over doing or under can harm your body. Never treating any food as bad, just recognizing having treats vs what your body needs. This was something I did over time in small ways since she was a toddler, not like I created some PowerPoint and showed her when she was older. As a teenager, she is now aware of my eating issues and we talk freely about it. She has told me how happy she was about how I taught her about food. She doesn't see food as an enemy.

One of my favorite quotes, which is technically about making amends with people, also works very well for ED recovery:

""Redemption stories are nice, but I think the reality is more like sweeping the floor. In our bare feet we notice that the floor is dirty, and then we can sweep the floor or not, but either way it will be a new situation tomorrow. We can't treat this as a problem; there is not a solution to it. But a clean floor is nice to walk on anyway, and someday we may even be able to sweep the floor because we respect the dignity of our feet and not because we are afraid of the dirt. Some days, that's why I sweep now."" -Pat the Bunny

An ED is not a separate illness like the flu. It's a cluster of symptoms that come out of your mental condition, and even when you've got it mostly under control or are at a healthy weight, you'll probably still find yourself having signs of it pop up now and then.

You may be at a point where you need to be eating significantly more than what you’re currently eating in order to gain some weight.

I’d definitely try to get in to see a Registered Dietician who specializes in eating disorders they’ll be able to help you get back on track and gain some weight.  It’s not easy but if you stick with it and follow the meal plan as best you can then it’ll be worth it. If you’re not already seeing a therapist that specializes in EDs I’d suggest doing that at the same time too b/c that will really help you take your ED head on and get better. It’s a lot of hard work to beat this disease but you’ll get your life back.

I can easily go a day without eating. After years of psychological conditioning from this, I really have to force myself to eat. It can be very difficult. I've been brought to tears forcing myself to eat before. I take antidepressants to make it easier, but even then... Just the physical act of chewing and swallowing in disturbingly unpleasant at times. So yes, I have poor nutritional habits...

I gained satisfaction from keeping it a secret. If this meant I had to eat to get someone from worrying, it still fit the notion of control and was okay(but I still had rules about specific foods. A single cookie at lunch was okay but a cookie at home wasn't. I had to leave at least a little food on the plate to show I was in control) . When I felt hunger it felt good because I was in control. Weight eventually played a small role but it wasn't a thing of ""I'm not thin enough"" it was more ""I can control this number.""

It may take trying a few different counselors before you find the right fit for you, but please, it is really important that you do talk to someone.

I had an odd ED that doesn't necessarily revolve around calories, but around types of food, numbers of servings, and many other similar aspects. My therapist gave me a challenge to go to a frozen yogurt place (within my growth zone), but to not read the labels and to try (ultimately buy) flavors based on taste, not nutritional content. I had my husband bring my samples so I couldn't even glance at the labels or the flavors. My favorite one surprised me!

My point in this is to say it may take some help from other people, it may involve sampling, and as far as calorie counting goes, I have learned that it doesn't really matter and it was pretty much only using my mental energy.

We tend to think of EDs as manifesting in stereotypical ways: an obsession with being thin, a fear of total calories, etc. I think it can be more helpful to consider some of those fixations as a symptom of larger anxiety issues, as there's so much overlap between obsessive-compulsive thought patterns and disordered eating.  


OP, you come across as an intelligent, self-aware, and highly anxious person. It's good that you're able to recognize these thoughts and patterns, and to note their increasing impact on your life. The thing where you get uncomfortable about eating too many calories in one meal? That sounds like fairly rigid and ritualistic thinking. I would urge you to take advantage of whatever services may be available to you at university in terms of counseling, etc.   


The fact that you are posting this means you know, on some level, that this is worth addressing for the sake of your greater well-being. Please, don't put this off. It may seem intimidating or embarrassing to think about telling someone all this is weighing on your mind. But trust me, it doesn't have to be a big deal -- people seek counseling all the time, for everything from ordinary grief to debilitating anxiety and just basic support with anything difficult they might be dealing with in life.   


Print out this post or write your thoughts in a bulleted list and bring that to your school's counseling center, or to your doctor. It's hard to talk about it in the moment, sometimes -- easier if you have a piece of paper to hand, as back-up in case you need it.

Many people, myself included, have gotten to a better place. Try to just take things one step at a time. Recovery isn't black and white, and it's not a straight progression forward. There are ups and downs, new challenges to face, and it's a steady learning process. I have a friend who says, ""It's all path,"" meaning it's all your journey. As much as you can, keep your focus on healing the deeper issues, less on appearance.

It's courageous and healthy that you are opening up about this. Lifting any shame around struggling can be very healing.

It sounds like you have/had people around you who have contributed to a narrative that boils down to ""you are not enough"" not skinny enough, not pretty enough, not enough weight etc - but you *are* enough. It sounds like this narrative is the dominant force behind it, and believe me when I tell you that you are not alone in it. Women are bombared with impossible standards, and it is no wonder that \~90% or so of eating disorder sufferers are women. These people around you probably have no idea the harm that they have done to you by saying the things that they have. One way that can be helpful is to reach out to other sufferers; there is a certain universality to suffering from eating disorders. You can always relate on some level of experience, and in that there is comfort. Comfort in knowing that it *isn't* just you, and that others have suffered the same way at the mercy of the same kinds of people.

It is really brave of you to reach out to all of us as well, by the way. Writing things like this down into a post can help you to really make sense of the thoughts in your head. It can help you to understand how and why you feel this way. The strategy is always to gradually be able to challenge the thoughts that you have about yourself, and the ones that have been internalized due to other people. 

&gt; Now I stare at other girls on the street with boobs and I hate, hate, hate myself for what I did to, myself. 

You are the victim here, not the perpetrator. Eating disorders consume your whole existence, and they can make you feel like you deserve it somehow, and that you caused it. But you did not cause it, your brain is telling you to do or not do certain things based on what has been learned as a result of other people. This is the web that we have to learn how to untangle. I am happy to talk about this more, or help you to start challenging your thoughts if you like. I mean it though OP, I know that you will be ok, I am happy to talk about it all if you want to.

87,9dgqba,jsweetie2,1536229108.0,2018-09-06 05:18:28,"My parents watched me for years with an eating disorder. Obviously it’s not the same dynamic as a romantic partner, but the one thing I can tell you is that they saw a psychiatrist who told them “She will decide when she needs help and that’s when recovery begins. You can’t force someone to recover if they aren’t ready”. Which I think is pretty true. 

So in the meantime, I’d recommend a few things. Don’t comment on her weight gain/loss; don’t tell her she’s looking healthy (because although this sounds encouraging, actually in ED language it means “ah ok you’re at an average/not thin weight”; stock up on vitamins so if she’s not getting nutrition at least try to give her some essential vits; watch some documentaries on YouTube to fully understand her mindset (if you feel a bit lost) and I guess just be patient. If she really really starts to get sick (I.e. fainting, very low BMI) then that’s another story. In that case you might need to speak to a professional.

All the best! ",Perpetualbleugh,1536229143.0,2018-09-06 05:19:03,"Don't nag her or question her about her eating habits. Don't try and force her to eat or blackmail her into eating. Don't comment on her size or compliment weight loss OR gain.  You can talk to her about her ED if she brings it up. You can gently express your concern and offer support. Depending on the type of ED, simply telling her that you find her beautiful and don't want her to be slimmer won't magically cure the problem so don't be disheartened when it doesn't. 
Try if you can to read up as much information as possible about her SPECIFIC ED but don't bombard her with that info- just keep it to yourself so you can better understand what's going on. 
Most importantly- you can't cure her. And trying to push her towards recovery will simply make here secretive and resentful towards you. Just make sure she always knows you're there for her. An ED can and often is a life long journey for many, and even if/ when they recover, they may still be in remission forever. 

Good luck OP! It's great to see such concern and understanding from the partner of an ED Sufferer. ",covhr,1536229471.0,2018-09-06 05:24:31,"things you can do:
* don't comment on her appearance AT ALL
* eat with her whenever possible. This may mean eating when you're full. Suck it up! 
* don't become the food police. She (hopefully) has a dietitian and therapist who will be monitoring what she eats
* don't judge. She has an illness. If she had diabetes you wouldn't question what was going on. 
* lastly, ask her what she needs from you! When I was married (I am no longer), I needed my partner to do all of the above, plus acknowledge that I was fighting every day. 
",EnviablePhantom,1536239536.0,2018-09-06 08:12:16,"I think the best you can do is let her know you love her and want the best for her. Like the others said, don’t comment on her weight loss (gain as well, but especially the weight loss aspect). Personally, when someone says I look good, or if my boyfriend brings it up, inside my head I end up twisting those words into “I’m losing weight and they like it, so I’ll keep going because it’s making me feel good and others are noticing”. Even though that’s 100% my brain and something I need to work through AND I know my bf is just trying to be sweet, I think it’s best to avoid phrasing compliments like that. 

The vitamins thing is also a great idea - and eating with her. Don’t nag and don’t comment that she barely eats. Instead, maybe try planning a cute dinner so you guys can sit together. I know eating with others is scary for me, but it ends up helping; could be the same thing with her. But most importantly: talk to her and see if there’s anything she needs you to do or be apart of.

After being in denial for years (as in, most of my life), I finally started seeing a therapist who specializes in ED and trauma. I cannot describe the agony, and relief, of speaking with someone who actually understood me. 

My advice is to go to the group. The worst thing that happens is that's not the kind of atmosphere you can work in, and maybe they can refer you to someone for counseling.

My therapist lectures me when I think about all the people who have it worse, and have had it worse, and who ""need help"". She says it's not a competition. The fact of the matter is you are mentally ill, and you need help. There's no magical ""sickness"" number, no way to ""look like"" you have an eating disorder.

90,9cxsmb,misunderstoodsamurai,1536094217.0,2018-09-04 15:50:17,"I remember experiencing this towards the beginning of my recovery process and it was a living hell. I think it’s because your brain has been deprived of certain nutrients and stuff, so when you’re getting excited about eating it’s all good until you eat, when you feel those intense negative feelings that make you rethink what you ate. I think it’s from your brain not being fed those vitamins and whatever to make your brain used to processing them, so suddenly it’s a new thing to your brain again and it’s all overwhelming with a ton of emotions and your brain just doesn’t know what to do. It’s not used to this. It’s not used to the change. But it’s all going to be okay and it DOES pass if you just keep going at it. You’ll get used to the sensations and they’ll change.

I hope that made somewhat sense ",bladesman393,1536157712.0,2018-09-05 09:28:32,"Hi OP, sorry to hear things are difficult at the moment. Some people think that with eating disorders we are never really \*cured\* per se, just permanently in recovery. I am also sorry to hear that your recent difficulties with eating were brought on by trauma. Sometimes problems with eating are a principal point of difficulty, other times they are a byproduct of depression/anxiety etc. Have you been able to speak to someone about the trauma you underwent? If you feel your eating patterns have been triggered more from trauma, then it might be best to seek a way to come to terms with that trauma. If not, support from an organization who helps people with eating disorders could be good?

&gt; But I feel guilty for not working, for being so sick in bed while  everyone around me works and probably wonders why I’m so useless. 

You are not useless, I promise you. Guilt and shame are \*difficult\* codes to rewrite, they tether us to old ways of seeing and being. What you need to be given is the tools to start challenging your thoughts, and not being held prisoner by them. A therapist needs to teach you how to become the Warden, not the prisoner. To start with, you can try challenging some of the things you think about yourself. For example in the quote above, why would anyone think you are useless? Would you look at a friend or family member and judge them to be useless? I know that I wouldn't. The standards we set for ourselves seem to be much higher than those for other people. In this way, sharing our feelings and experiences with others can help us to balance our unrealistic expectations of ourselves, with the support that they have for us.

Over time you can begin to challenge some of the more difficult aspects of the eating disorder. You mentioned you have found it impossible to use the kitchen. I have had this, because I feel lots of shame about eating and preparing food. I started to challenge this recently by baking. I wanted to bake something so that I can have friends round one night to watch the Great British Bake Off. So for me, I am preparing food, but I am doing it for other people so that they can enjoy it. It was tough, because a housemate (who is very nice) came in and said ""oh I have never seen you bake before!"" and I got very nervous. We build these things up in our minds to be so big and so scary that we cannot see a way around them. We need to challenge, or have somebody else challenge these thoughts, or else we will never overcome them. It is all about baby steps, a small challenge here and there, a small change over time, and gradually we can take back some control in our daily routines.

For me, when I feel at the mercy of my eating disorder, I need to reach out to other sufferers. I need to be reminded that the feelings I have are not unique to me, and that they are temporary. You have been in recovery before and you will be again, but please try to reach out to people and talk about how you are feeling. Please feel free to send me a message if you want to chat about anything, we are all in this together after all. Take care, hope to hear back from you soon.

It sounds like your eating behaviours changed quite quickly, and so 2 months is for sure enough time to have seen a significant change in yourself. Some medical advice is quite unhelpful in this regard, specifically with anorexia for example. I have friends of mine who have known they were struggling with anorexia, but their body mass index was not low *enough* and so they were not diagnosed. However their weight had dropped significantly over several months, so any reasonable person could tell that they were on a downward path. The big picture was that my friend was in trouble, but she hadn't lose *enough* weight, which seems like such a missed opportunity for a medical professional to have helped her sooner.  

Overall OP, from what you have said, you have identified a problem, and there is no undermining that whatsoever. Can you seek support from organizations who help people with eating disorders? The way to start recovering is to be able to challenge the behaviours you are noticing. Can you identify why you stick to a specific amount of calories? Do you use an app? A friend once said she had to delete MyFitnessPal because she was becoming obsessed with it. Is there any way you could *not* count calories? 

I wonder also if there are vegan-specific resources you could seek out? Some people are very savvy with finding ways to eat very healthily but still consume the calories they need. Does HCLF mean high carb/low fat? One warning about low fat, is that fat is fine really depending on the type; fat is also an appetite suppressant. You can consume plenty of fat from natural sources like nuts, but ""low fat"" products tend to replace fat with sugar, which can make your body feel like it is lacking something.

Best wishes going forward OP, hope you are able to find a good way to start changing your behaviours. You have identified a series of behaviours that have caused a change in yourself and that is enough. Take care!",daisycharlotte,1536415736.0,2018-09-08 09:08:56,"Please, please seek help right now. I went to the doctor 6 months in after friends breaking down about how worried they were about me. I majorly played it down because I didn’t want them to make me eat so I got no help.

Fast forward 6 incredibly painful years.. eating disorders still complete control my life. They have stolen away my early 20s. It’s stripped me of my confidence, my social life, university grades, job opportunities and the possibility of having a boyfriend. I constantly cycle between months of restriction and then binging, meaning I yo-yo between a UK size 10/12 and 6. 

After finally going on antidepressants this spring, I feel I’m finally open to getting help and therapy and am now on a 8 month waitlist. I wish more than anything in the whole, wide world I could go back in time to that first doctors visit and beg for help. It is never, ever too early to get help. Back then I didn’t want anorexia taken away from me, instead I let it take years of my life away.  Please don’t let that happen to you, because it will just  creep up on you and before long you’ll be in a dark pit where you feel like you can’t get yourself help. The iller you get, the less you’ll feel worthy of help + consumed by the illness. I still hugely struggle with the thought that I’m not ‘bad’ enough to get help. But, you know what, even if doctors were to actually think that- on my positive days, I really believe I’ve been through enough now and I do deserve it.

It is extremely difficult to get out of this on your own. Getting help now could save you a lifetime of misery. Please get help. Good luck x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maybe your ED isn’t causing you severe physical danger at this point (I would argue that if you got that diagnosis after your first visit, you definitely have the associated dangerous psychological distress, and anyway, perhaps you are physically at risk as well and just don’t know it yet), but your weight does not determine your sickness. I could repeat that a million times. 

Having such an adverse reaction to losing your scale and the deep need you feel to get to your goal weight is textbook ED stuff. The idea is that the illness grows as you feed it (as you lose weight) and reinforces all the bad psychological beliefs that go with it. Doing the ED behaviours strengthens the need for the behaviours and you become more and more and more entrenched in toxic thinking patterns.

It keeps telling you that everything will get better once you hit those magic numbers on the scale.

Well, all I can tell you is, I hit mine a while back. Nothing changed. I was still what I considered to be fat. I was still miserable. I still hated how I looked. I was able to wear new, smaller clothes, but I still cried in the changing room when one single jean wouldn’t fit... 
So I set a new goal weight for myself. I realized it will never be enough. I will never be thin enough. Because what I see in the mirror is not a reflection of how I look; it’s a reflection of everything I hate about myself and think is wrong with me. I will always seek out my imperfections and only see what I don’t like about myself. 

At the end of the day it took me a few trips to the dentist, passing out in public numerous times because of malnourishment, and a few other health issues to finally realize what I was doing to myself.

All I’m saying is... don’t let it get to that point if you can stop it now where it’s not that bad. Take care of yourself. Treat yourself like you deserve it; better than this. 

In the end it’s your decision but I really hope you’ll find your way and stay healthy. It’s a slippery slope and I never would’ve imagined that I’d end up where I did when I first started dieting. 

Please just take care of yourself. I wish you all the best. ",Wilk1602,1536942362.0,2018-09-14 11:26:02,"It’s more about finding happiness within yourself and your life. It’s important to remove the association of happiness with the number on the scale. Trust me, if you get to your “goal weight” there will still be unhappiness in your life because how much you weigh will not fix the anxiety and depression. 

You have to stop putting so much importance on a number. That number does not define you. 

And ask yourself this- who are you and how much do you value yourself if you take dieting out of the equation? That’s why you stop. You have to find the answer to that question.

Goal weight should be your set point; the number that if you add or take away a significant number of calories for a few days, it would not shift significantly.  If you are fighting to get to a goal weight, then you are not choosing a number that is healthy for your frame and size.  I would recommend that you talk to an eating disorder-specialized registered dietician (not a ""nutritionist"", but an RD).

As far as diet, just make sure you aren't restricting because that can often lead to a binge. I don't think drastic changes are usually helpful, so aim for small changes.

There are two main things to consider. One is that your body might need more calories than you are giving it and this is just a natural step in your progress. The other is the emotional aspect. Sometimes when we feel overwhelmed, resorting to unhealthy behaviors can feel temporarily comforting. 

In addition to addressing what and how you're eating, be sure to go to the deeper issues. Try not to be judgmental about what you eat.

A non-underweight weight is definitely not an indicator of health or non-sickness when it comes to eating disorders. You recognize that you at least have disordered eating and have for a long long time and that alone is grounds for getting help. Hopefully your therapist isn’t of the opinion that an ED is more or less valid depending on the weight of the sufferer. And if they are, then that’s their mistake and not an indication that you don’t deserve help.

If you feel like your ED is not a problem and simultaneously don’t want to give up control via talking about it, then maybe you’re just not ready to make any changes yet! And that’s okay. It seems that people typically reach out for help when their illness causes them significant distress, moreso than the comfort they are afforded by their ED. But it also seems a little like it might be starting to really adversely affect your life if your significant other is starting to notice and you have expressed the importance of keeping your ED a secret. That secrecy is a hallmark of EDs and tends to cause isolation, lying, alienation from friends/family, etc. Just from experience, EDs have a numbing effect and it’s sometimes hard to see how it’s adversely affecting your life, especially if it’s been going on for a long time and especially if you’re a high functioning sufferer. 

Even just being honest about it with someone can help to break down some mental barriers imposed by an ED. If your therapist can be that person, it might be a really therapeutic, validating experience without any of the pressure to change/immediately recover that often comes with telling a family member or significant other. 

When I started looking into therapy options, I didn’t bother with anyone that didn’t explicitly specialize in eating disorders and it ended up being a very, very good decision. It’s a tricky disorder to treat, so if your current therapist isn’t an ED therapist, maybe you could ask them up refer you to someone who is? That might alleviate your fears about giving up control/secrecy as, for example, any ED therapist knows not to push for change until the client believes they’re ready. Moreover, the odds of an ED therapist inadvertently judging or misunderstanding you/what you need are much lower.

One of the best strategies to address this kind of issue is to work with a team of people. Recovery teams can include a dietitian, a medical doctor, a therapist, and even body workers.  Because you are so new to recovery, it's so important to address the bigger issues before you decide if losing weight is what you really want to do. It can be very tempting to grab the reins too tightly after a period of allowing your body the nourishment it needs. A team can help you determine what's healthy for you at a given time. 

If you are worried about a relapse, that's a good indicator that you're probably not quite ready to try any kind of diet or losing regimen. Your weight should stabilize the longer you are in recovery. Trust your own process and give yourself more time. Keep working on your self esteem and your recovery and try not to focus on your weight right now. Focus more on how you feel and your overall health and well-being. There are some great resources on the HAES website. We can be so hard on ourselves and not see ourselves accurately because of all the outside and internal pressures we face. 

Whatever you decide, try to get support. The initial stages of recovery can be a confusing time. ",Doodlebug75,1537366693.0,2018-09-19 09:18:13,"This is something I’ve been struggling with/concerned about.  Brief background on me:  history of anorexia, solidly in recovery for 15 years.   I gained weight into the obese range for a variety of reasons and stopped exercising regularly.  

I decided I needed to lose weight for my own health.  I was extremely worried about the anorexia voice in my head turning back on - which it did for about a week.  I have a therapist who is really good at what she does for support.  I lucked out with a great personal trainer at my gym -  her emphasis is on building strong, functional muscles.  I have learned more about letting go of being perfect from my trainer than I ever though possible (it’s hard to be perfect at single leg dead lifts with 30 lbs of kettle bell). If I thought I needed a dietitian,  I’d be all in for that too.

Bottom line: it’s totally doable but surround yourself with objective support.  Exercise is huge in terms of feeling good - for me, it’s a time out from the day and I have measurable progress to point to with my workouts. The therapist piece is huge as well:  I have no doubt she would call bullshit if she saw it.  Get a dietitian involved if you need meal planning/macro assistance.

Hope that helps!",ArcadiaXYZ,1537388943.0,2018-09-19 15:29:03,"Same experience, I've been in recovery successfully  since January but tried for the year before. I gained 70lbs.

I'm going to link you a couple of studies as soon as I am on a laptop, but basically, best thing you can do is fox the metabolism issues first trying to raise Bmr, that might mean weight gain / maintenance for 6/8 weeks (time it takes.for the body to adapt) then possibly in my case a low carb diet has been working, slower than it used to, but it works by at least not stimulate insulin as much as carbs, meaning you don't store as much I to fat cells if insulin stays lower",colourscaptivating,1537392165.0,2018-09-19 16:22:45,"You've been in recovery for 2 months.

It's possible that your weight will slowly decrease over that time. If it doesn't, and you still want to lose it, being more firmly recovered will give you a better foundation before you start trying to lose it. Being obese for an extra 6 months isn't going to ruin your health forever, but trying to lose weight too soon after recovery has a big chance of fucking up your mental health more.

I highly doubt gaining 30 lbs puts you in the obese category, and even if it does we know quite confidently as this point that BMI is a bullshit measure for anything useful. If you’re the weight you are and you’re eating intuitively and mindfully, getting the right balance of foods and feel good (ie you don’t feel exhausted, faint, or in pain all the time), then there is absolutely nothing wrong with your weight or diet. Maybe it’s just your set point and that’s where your body wants to be. There is no reason to lose weight and your drive to do so, (like many folks who recover and feel they’ve gained too much, and then fall backwards into weight loss attempts in the name of health(ism),) is just disordered. I would be cautious about speaking to any old nutritionist - I would seek out an ED dietician instead. They have more education and are certified (dietician vs nutritionist) and I would also make sure they’re a Health At Every Size dietician. Diet culture is insanely lucrative and makes its money off of getting people to chase after weight loss under the guise of health, so it wouldn’t surprise me if that’s the advice you were given by one. I can’t stress enough that weight loss is not a health panacea and if anything could negatively affect your health if you’re recovering from an ED.

In the six years that I've been going in and out of recovery with this ED, it has sometimes been the only thing holding me together. I still hold onto that part of me, but because it *can* help with efficiency and flow in daily living, not because I *need* it for everything to be okay.

The biggest turning point for me, was to realise that **none of it matters**, and that came during inpatient when I looked at how much I was panicking about which part of the meal I *should* eat first in the context of digestive health (a mealtime ritual of mine). I decided, ""do the opposite,"" and it scared the shit out of me but I did it, and the world didn't end. I started applying that to other things, like eating different foods, asking for random orders, and just basically changing things up to mess with the routine because I realised **the world will not end if I'm not in control of things all the time**.

There are plenty of ways to use your mind to deal with and justify control and the possible loss of control. For example, whenever I get anxious about anything whether it be weight gain or a job interview, I say, ""Liam, what is the very worst that could happen?"" and not caring so much about death, our common worst fear, I discover, **the very worst thing that could happen is that I'll have to deal with how I feel if \[thing\] does/doesn't happen**. Big deal. Of course I'm scared of my own mind more than anything else, but I *can* handle it, and so can you. Your mind is so powerful, it got you here and it'll get you out of it.

That, to me, is why you want the situation to be perfect. The best remedy is to keep eating often, and never, ever miss meals or your meal plan if you have one. If you are undereating, your body is still thinking it needs to protect whatever it can get, so your brain reads this as ""do not let anyone/thing get in the way of this!"".

With eating disorders, it can be tricky because our minds are so powerful and can trick us into thinking we are doing OK when we are really struggling.

A friend and I were just talking about the fear of gaining weight and how we can try to challenge it by focusing instead on health. One therapist I had challenged me to take the fear and do a ""and then what?"" scenario. For example, I'm afraid of gaining weight, and if I do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will happen. Then ask if the part you filled in is accurate, realistic, or a true phobia. I'm afraid of gaining weight because I will be unlovable. Is this a true statement? No. Where does it come from? etc. It's a good exercise. You keep challenging the thoughts until you get to the deeper issues. 

It's possible to have a combination of disorders or tendencies. If you are purging, there's definitely an element of bulimia, but you can also have anorexic tendencies. It's important to address both. 

You're definitely not fake and can still suffer even when you have good days or even a stretch of good days. These are illnesses that take a toll over time. 

I'm glad you are under the care of an ED team. That's great that you are getting support. Try to trust the process. Do you think you need inpatient treatment? If so, it's so important to reach out to your team. If you need something more immediate, there are eating disorder hotlines you can call. I believe the NEDA website has some resources listed that include more emergency type hotlines. 

The one good thing about being really sick and tired of it all is that it can be a good time to change or even think about change. Sometimes when things seem the darkest is when we are more motivated to take a leap of faith. Hang in there. I hope you can get the support you need. ",siewwan,1538138288.0,2018-09-28 07:38:08,I am an anorexic turned bulimic. It is good that you get help early. It is easier to turn around before you are seriously stuck.

It sounds like you’ve started to be honest with yourself… the next step is to be honest and truthful with your therapist.  You’ve already started the process, now it’s time to dig in and work.  I’m proud of you for taking the first step! Good luck, and I wish you peace on your journey!",bladesman393,1538090879.0,2018-09-27 18:27:59,"Last I checked, 65% of ED sufferers, suffer commingled depression and/or anxiety, so it could be really important to tell your therapist in order for them to be able to provide you the most targetted care, if that makes sense? For me I suffered depression/anxiety but later realised it was an ED, because of my own misguided perceptions of what an ED actually was.

&gt; Sometimes life throws so much at me that **I fall back into my ED  because  it’s what I CAN control**. If I recover...what do I have when  everything  is wrong? 

I am not so sure I get what you mean here OP, I mean, the idea is that if someone is in control then they don't have an ED. Just ask yourself if it is something that you control, and not the other way around...

Overall when it comes to mental illness, I am in favour of telling your therapist everything; they are the one person with whom you can just leave everything on the floor. I suppose I worry that if I miss something important out, it means that they have less to work with. The more complete a picture of you your therapist has, the better the care they can provide you. Sorry things are really tough at the moment, hope you manage to make some forward progress soon.",MalortMistress,1538094847.0,2018-09-27 19:34:07,"I weirdly understand exactly what you mean with the control component. My ED helped my feel like I was still sort of “master of of my domain.” When everything spirals, you still feel like you have control over your own body. However! Tell your therapist this! It sounds like you’re using the ED as a coping mechanism, and a therapist can help you identify what you’re coping with and develop healthier mechanisms. 

You’re taking time and potentially money out of your life might as well get the most out of it! ",iloveyouketchup,1538104583.0,2018-09-27 22:16:23,"hi, so i have had bulimia for 7 years and i have been going to therapists for 5 of those 7 years. therapists are required to keep everything confidential, so it doesn't even necessarily mean that everyone will be ""on alert"" because they don't even have to know. But I think telling your therapist is at least a step in the right direction. I went through 5 years of therapy with just my therapists knowing about my disorder and my parents nor anyone in my life having a clue. (I'm not saying you should follow my example either though...I wish I had told people in my life sooner so I could have started the process of recovery sooner and had support from people who love me). But once you start the process of recovery, you will realize that you don't need your eating disorder when things go wrong. You will discover other methods of coping that aren't detrimental to your health. I think you should definitely tell your therapist to start your journey on the way to recovery...its a hell of a fight, but it is worth it to regain real control of your life.",lizefb,1538108831.0,2018-09-27 23:27:11,"I agree with the others who suggested telling your therapist. Therapy can sometimes show you how to go from wanting to want to get better to actually wanting to get better, if that makes sense, but you have to be honest in order to get there. 

I think one of the others who commented is right that it sounds like you are using the eating disorder as a coping mechanism. Therapy can teach you healthier ways to cope. That way, when you feel overwhelmed you have tools you can use instead of relying on your illness. 

Keep in mind, too, that the more your body is struggling and not getting the proper nutrients, the more it affects your thinking. Recovery can actually help your perspective change, and there's a good chance that your thinking will become more clear. 

I know how scary it can be. It's sort of like giving up a part of yourself in a way, but try to see it more as as regaining your health and reclaiming who you are. Recovery can allow you to participate more fully and engage in life. You get to experience and feel more instead of going through the days feeling numb and distracted. 

I hope you can tell your therapist. You have support here. You're not alone. ",angeryveg,1538125655.0,2018-09-28 04:07:35,"I think this is a very, very tricky situation at times. If you are itching to talk to her one-on-one, but may not be ready for ED treatment, follow up on what her policies are. 

When I was going to therapy in college, my university’s psychiatrist was sworn to refuse continued treatment for my depression/anxiety if I did not agree to ED treatment. ED’s are taken VERY seriously (as they should be), but this was not a corner I was ready to be pushed into at the time. 

Because I needed anti-depressants at the time, I was forced to attend 3 ED  appointments a week at a treatment center. With school, this was extremely burdensome, and I was not mentally ready to let go of my habits (they were so comforting at this time of stress). 

Seeking help is what will save you. It’s courageous and will change your life for the better. This is not to scare you, as treatment is already so terrifying, but to rather inform you about what /could/ happen. Read up on the policies and make sure that your therapist can keep it between the two of you until you are ready for further action.

Best of luck and well wishes to you and your recovery! 💕",doritocombo,1538147148.0,2018-09-28 10:05:48,"I understand that feeling so well. I tried to manage my ED on my own for so long, and yo-yo’d in between wanting to recover and wanting to let myself continue on with my ED. 

This was until I had a breakdown and couldn’t stand the pressure and the self-hatred my ED was fueling. Telling my fiancé I needed help was like taking a secret weight off my shoulders. And I only told him so he could hold me accountable to seek help out. I’ve been seeing my therapist for two months now and even though I’m making slow progress it was done so much good for me. I’m sorry and I don’t mean to make such a self centered comment. Your story is so easy to relate to. 

ED is not a sustainable life style. I recommend getting help, even if you aren’t ready to put your ED behind you completely it’s a good first step. Someone to at least share your feelings and thoughts with is still better than keeping it all bottled up. 

Giving you internet hugs(if you want them). You definitely aren’t alone in your feelings and struggles.

Forcing someone to eat is definitely not the answer. Many times, people with eating disorders feel a loss of control, so trying to exert control over her may actually backfire. 

I would first get some resources through the NEDA website on how you can support her. You might even consider attending an Al-ANON meeting to learn about co-dependency. 

Being honest and apologizing is the way to go. If you can explain that your concern is what caused you to lash out, maybe she will understand that you meant well. Just let her know you care and that you want to help. 

Ask her how you can support her, too. See if she has any ideas on what you can do when you are feeling frustrated. 

Try not to be hard on yourself or on her. This is a difficult illness for everyone involved. It would be really helpful if you can get support as well.

Whether it's a therapist, dietitian, group therapy, or a medical doctor, confiding in someone is the best way to address the issues you are having. 

It's possible that your coping strategy is eating disorder behaviors. This becomes a vicious cycle if your get stressed about money and then resort to unhealthy behaviors. The more you use the unhealthy behaviors, the more stress you're under, and it ultimately doesn't solve the money issues. Having some kind of support through this and learning new ways to handle all kinds of stress will help you in all ways. 

If you are vomiting due to something other than an eating disorder, you should definitely see a medical doctor. 

I hope you can get some support through everything you are going through. It sounds like you have a lot on your shoulders. Sometimes even just talking about it can be a relief.

We are all different genetically. We also differ in how we process emotions and feelings. We are all unique. Trying to compare yourself with someone without knowing their struggles, their history, their genetics can end up making you feel bad about yourself. Your celeb crush might have an eating disorder or might be naturally thin. There's no way for you to know. Try as much as you can to focus more on yourself, how you feel and what your goals outside of beauty are. Your identity is not tied to how you look. It's more about WHO you are, not what you look like. 

I think the other comment about orthorexia is right. This is something to definitely bring up in therapy. Rachael Steil has some good resources on her blog. She dealt with orthorexia and has some good advice about how to move into recovery. 

The key is to try to understand what's under all this distraction, what the rules are all about. A lot of times we create rules in order to distract ourselves from feelings or being uncomfortable or to feel a (false) sense of control. It's an unhealthy way to cope, but you can learn healthier coping strategies.  

Good luck to you. I'm glad you are open and honest about what you're going through. Honesty, both with yourself and with others, is an important key to getting well. ",patchso1967,1538477545.0,2018-10-02 05:52:25,"Most important thing - admit you have a problem. You've done that. 

Second - get professional medical help. Sounds like you've done that. 

So you're heading in the right direction. 

Some suggestions: stop measuring yourself. This won't be easy, so start small and build up. For example, start by measuring yourself only every other day. Dump the BMI calculator from your phone. 

Try to wean yourself off of your crush. Once again, start small. 

Try to work towards what would be considered 'normal eating patterns'. 

Put yourself in someone else's mind, how would they respond to your thoughts?

Most important, keep at the therapy. Mental health problems are notoriously difficult to break out of and tend to take a long time. Keep at it. Best of luck :-)

PS. There are lots of really good self help books available online. Look for one specifically dealing with eating disorders and one where the author has relevant expertise.

When I was in gymnastics, I had a friend and she was built with a lot of muscle. She was shorter than me, but weight more than I did and I think she was technically higher up on the bmi chart. She was not unhealthy just because she weighed more.

For the feeling of eating “unhealthy” foods, I have personally learned that no food in and of itself is unhealthy. It’s the excessive consumption of the food that is the unhealthy action. Our bodies do react to different foods in different ways. I personally eat a lot of carbs in my diet because i’m very picky and struggle with variety. My stomach bloats a lot by the end of the day. But I don’t gain weight. My body changes shape, but my weight stays the same.

By eating what your craving in the moment and not depriving yourself of that item, it helps with the urge to overeat. I used to binge on nutella, but now I have an appropriate amount of nutella whenever I want it to keep myself from thinking and feeling like it’s a forbidden food.

All of the things that you’re feeling is completely normal in recovery. Personally, this month marks a year completely out of treatment (other than op appointments).

Would you refuse inpatient care if you had an illness like cancer? No? Then why would you treat an ED, a serious illness all on its own, any differently?

I strongly hope you reconsider. If you don't, the very least you can do is make your health a priority from home. Go to support groups, therapy, your doctors weekly or as needed.

Like you point out, it’s like gum, right? 

I actually thought it was so clever that I told my mom and she gave me such a look of concern and sadness that was totally different to what I expected. She told me it wasn’t healthy at all and I couldn’t really understand at that time.

Later on, I wrote a message on a calorie counting website I used then and asked if anyone thought it was unhealthy. The most memorable response was this:
“If you have to ask, you probably already know what the answer is.”

Chewing and spitting isn’t going to rupture your stomach or starve you to death like bulimia or anorexia might, but you don’t have to be doing those behaviors to have an eating disorder or for it to be dangerous. 

Chewing and spitting IS an extreme behavior. It means that you obviously are afraid of the act of eating whatever foods you’ve put in your mouth. No, chewing and spitting isn’t normal and it isn’t healthy. 

In fact, I think it means that you’re on the spectrum of disordered eating which isn’t surprising considering that you’re dieting—I know that not all dieters have disordered eating but almost all people with EDs diet or have dieted. 

Go talk to a therapist about this and start seriously looking at your eating habits before they get out of control.

But I’ll also tell you that you’re definitely consuming sugar as you do it. Your body is still intaking sugar and calories. Just not as many. 
So if that’s what makes you feel satisfied in your sweet tooth but helps your brain remain in control of your eating habits, then do you boo!

Yours is one of the least damaging habits there is, but it’s still a habit none the less. ",lizefb,1539446426.0,2018-10-13 11:00:26,"I agree with the other poster who said it is disordered eating. The big problem is that it can lead to worse behaviors and isn't healthy to begin with. Some health concerns are that when you do this, you're still activating stomach acids by the act of chewing, and with no or minimal food to digest, you could potentially cause ulcers or other digestive problems. The other issue is that it can sort of trick your feedback system and make it more difficult for you to be aware of what your body actually needs. 

The bigger question is why you feel you have to deprive yourself of sweets if you generally eat healthy. Is this strictly a focus on weight? Does it have to do with feeling like you don't deserve it? There should be room in any diet for a wide variety of foods. It might be best to work on the underlying issues and your desire to not gain weight or lose weight to understand the drive to engage in this kind of behavior. Perhaps seeing a therapist would be helpful in this area. Also, a good dietitian might be able to help you come up with a healthy meal plan that includes foods you crave. This could help you see that even a healthy diet can include desserts and sugar. 

Chewing and spitting is classified as disordered eating. It's not always as harmful as some of the others, but it can lead to dental and other health problems over time. Try to address why you are doing this. Generally if we have to ask the question, a part of us knows the answer, even if we may not want to face it.  

I hope you can feel more comfortable eating the foods you like. We should never feel like we have to deny ourselves.

Group therapy sounded super intimidating and scary and I refused for YEARS, but really it’s more a class where you learn these DBT skills and have homework on them with other people with problems.

The people who say “lost 7 years of my life” or whatever, are probably the ones who haven’t gotten the self compassion bit down. Which is so hard and takes time. To recover means to practice self compassion. I’m betting “non-ED” people don’t practice it either. An eating disorder is just one flavor of coping mechanism. It forces us to take a deep look inside (scary right?). 

The ability to practice introspection and use that to live life as best I can is a direct result of the work I’ve done battling my own ED.

In the throes of it, there was a lot of numbness and distraction. But it's not like one day I was sick and one day I was suddenly well. 

One of my mentors has a saying that it's all journey. The key is to discover what your eating disorder is telling you and how it serves you. By uncovering the reasons why you use certain behaviors, you can begin to learn new ways to cope with the root issues. So often, the focus is on the symptoms, eating a certain way, following recovery rules etc. The solution is to go deeper than that. 

I don't think recovery stories are always helpful. Your experience is unique, so your set of recovery tools will have to be different than what anyone else uses. There are specifics to address such as self regulation, finding your identity and how you define yourself, healing past trauma, and engaging in community or charity, but these are all vague suggestions that each person can address individually and uniquely. 

Don't give up, though. There is always hope. It's a matter of being willing to keep moving forward even when you feel stuck and tired of it all.

Seeing a therapist or even journaling might give you some insight about what's going on on a emotional level that's driving your desire to take control through weight loss. 

Does your husband know? Perhaps he could be of some support. Therapy is always a good option if you can afford it and have a good one near you.

- don't question what she has eaten, just observe and keep it to yourself

- don't try to impose rules. Ask how she would like to helped. Ask her what her fears are and what small goals she would like to achieve. You might not think that eating a specific food or eating ten grams more of a food is a huge deal, but it really is.

- please don't take away any scales (food or for personal weight).  If you're going to ask about weight, ask open ended questions like ""how do you feel about this?""

There are different eating disorders apart from anorexia / bulimia ; such as psychogenic ED ( which I have) , the latter does not make it seem like you avoid food on purpose but there are deep psychological reasons why your food intake is reduced / consists of patterns.

The excess calories are sort of like room for your body to grow into. Maybe just start slowly getting back into the gym perhaps?

Some residential facilities have VERY MILD lifting programs for people who are getting their calories in and not demonstrating extremely disordered thoughts and ideas about exercise in relation to food.

If you are spending your exercise time with the mindset of ""compensating"" for the calorie increase, then I would advise against exercising. On the other hand, if you are going into it with a performance mindset, I think it can be a great tool for recovery because, at least in my experience, performance improvements only motivated me further. Of course, I would talk with your recovery team first.

&amp;#x200B;

My experience with exercise and recovery has been pretty good overall. I was quite underweight when I started to recover, but I was exercising a lot even before my eating disorder. I'd always enjoyed long-distance running, and thought losing weight would help me get faster (not entirely the reasoning behind my ED but) but I lost a lot of muscle too. I was worried that all of the extra calories when I committed to recovery would be stored as fat, not just for typical body-image reasons but also because I thought it would really slow me down. So I decided I would at least halve my running and start weightlifting. I was recovering alone; I did not have a team advising me, but I wouldn't advise this in general.

&amp;#x200B;

With the program I was following my strength improved super quickly. I at least doubled the weights I could lift within a few months, and I was finally able to do pullups and other calisthenic movements my friends could do but I never could. And I wasn't even lifting for hours every day : I was only lifting three times per week, 1 hour each. The incremental strength gains I saw with each workout pushed me to keep doing what I was doing. It also really eased the process of weight gain, in fact I turned to the mindset of wanting to gain weight. It wasn't immediate but after a few weeks it was there.

&amp;#x200B;

If this kind of mindset describes you, then I would talk with your advisors. And if you do end up lifting with your recovery, I would recommend starting light and focusing on nailing the form. For one thing I do not know the condition of your body right now; it might be so weak that starting with any heavy (feeling) weight could be dangerous. But also because from my own experience, good form is essential for preventing injury. Even if you think your form is good, it might not be. After getting the form down, or as you're building those movement patterns (just make sure to really start light), try out a beginner's LP program.

Dealing with person who has ED is hard, it is one of the darkest things I ever had to deal with.
I would advise getting some professional help, at least for yourself even you cannot make your GF to do it.

If she is not willing to aknowledge her condition, you might have to reconsider whole relationship, as cold as it sounds. I didn't, and we stayed together for 4 years and separated for unrelated reasons. Her condition got better along the way, but it really killed me to deal with it.

Even though she's doing better and I am over the whole relationship, I still get shivers when I think about her ED. It was dark, really fucking dark.

I don't know the details, but if she won't get help and you stay together, it might destroy you. Almost happened to me. I'm not suggesting you should instantly break up with her, but in case she is unwilling to get help after several attempts, you might have to.

I don’t know what you can do or say that will make her think differently, I know my partner could tell me I look fine or fit or sexy and I just won’t believe it. If he told me it was affecting him negatively because I’m hurting myself, I would think about getting help.

Don’t abandon her, give her a bit of time. Of course you need to take care of yourself too and if she refuses help there is no shame in splitting, I had to do this with my alcoholic ex.

For the last couple months up until about 2 weeks ago, I’d been getting sick like clockwork once a week. We’re talking throwing up and unable to even keep water down for a good 12 hours. 

I was completely convinced it was acid reflux. Started taking medication, started sitting up after I eat and propping myself up to sleep at night to help. No dice. After losing about 15 pounds in a month, I went to the doctor and they did a lot of blood work and tests to see if it was an allergy, etc. Nothing here either. 

I’ve battled a stress induced ED before. So I wasn’t 100% shocked when she said she thought it was a mental thing, but I’d become so afraid of the prospect of getting sick that I’d basically stopped eating altogether. We determined that my anxiety was manifesting itself this way and that I’d have to make a conscious effort to quell it. 

I’ve been in outpatient treatment once a week for a couple weeks now and have gone two weeks without getting sick. It’s really really hard, but the first week we started with me trying to consciously not adhere to the rules I’d placed on myself for eating (pills, eating on a certain schedule, certain foods, sitting up for x amount of time after) and to tell myself when I was anxious that “my body knows what to do with food.” 

I know it’s not the same, but I’d suggest maybe seeking out therapy for this to try to retrain your brain on your thoughts about food. It absolutely won’t be easy, but you can do it. Your mind does weird things and can very easily take control. Medication can help, but ultimately I don’t think it will “cure” or alter behavior— just decrease anxiety. 
Good luck!! I know how horrible being afraid to eat is. But you’re going to be okay and you can beat this.

He was a bit weird, but not in a way that made me think anything of it at that age. I went to use the bathroom and after a few moments my bottom was itching. It was irritated. I realised that the entire seat was covered in urine. I felt sick, disgusted. I cleaned myself up as well as I could, but I also wasn't in a position to pop in his bath or shower. I was only over for a few hours so no spare clothes and he was younger than me. I asked him about it and he burst into hysterical laughter. Almost like he planned it. 

To this day, almost 20 years later I still cannot sit at a toilet without wiping it beforehand. No matter what, no matter how clean it looks, I have to wipe it first. I've been living alone for a while now, it's literally just me here. I still need to wipe the seat down. It's a process I don't even think about. It's subconscious. I don't think I'm capable of consciously sitting on a seat if I know I haven't wiped it first. 

All of that because of one incident. 

I don't have any actual advice for you besides the usual stuff of seeking help, just a couple of suggestions. For actual food, right now something is better than nothing. Instead of just water or coffee, try something like powered soup. You can see all the powder for yourself and shift through it for hairs, and any hairs would be floating in the hot water which you could catch on a spoon. You need to condition yourself to know that not everything will have hairs, and this is a good starting point.

Also try stuff that you know won't have been processed in a factory. (this is a case where you'll have to force yourself to use logic even though it's difficult). Fresh fruit and vegetables straight out of the ground aren't going to have hairs. Oranges and bananas have skins on them which protect the fruit inside. No way for a hair to get in.

I also found something disgusting in food, but in a restaurant meal, a few years ago and had a similar reaction to you. The thing that got me eating again was starting with whole food with peels- apples, oranges, squash, cucumber, other fruit and veg with a defined peel that I could see was intact, which meant there was no possibility of something yucky being inside. It helped me get some nutrition while i was working out the phobia. I know your brain is telling you that ANY food might be contaminated, but maybe it might be easier to counter those thoughts little by little, starting with foods you know won't be contaminated, like food with peels.

I'd also recommend a course of cognitive behavioral therapy. It is extremely useful for specific fears like this. It teaches you methods to counter what your brain is telling you about your fear. It's very purposeful, and even a few weeks made an enormous difference for me. It's not like other kinds of therapy, you don't go deep into the history behind the thoughts, you just learn coping methods and how to face your fears without doing more damage.

Can you not get an English translator to help you seek therapy options? ",RedditMayne,1538934021.0,2018-10-07 12:40:21,"I can offer a few thoughts there.

It’s ok to have had a relapse. It happens. What matters now are the choices you make to get through it.

Moving away from home is a big stressor for some people. Starting a new school is another one. Either is enough to trigger a relapse of ED, drinking, self-harming,etc. 

Here are a few recommendations. 

Harm reduction—allow yourself to eat how you want for the rest of the day provided that first you eat something that’s really good for you, (An apple, for example.) The next week, bump it up to two apples, for example—always the first thing of the day and before you have anything else. Stick an apple in your mouth the moment you get out of bed  like some people do with cigarettes. Keep raising that minimum limit, but always allow that option to let yourself  eat what you want thy day after meeting that minimum requirement. (I mix it up: HMR 800 fortified nutrition shake mix packets are my minimums; it’s on Amazon Prime, and there’s a million ways to add sugar-free syrups/powders to them to keep them from being boring.)

If you can make international calls on your phone plan without any financial issues, call a crisis line in your home country when things get to be too much. Try also to get to know other people from your home country at your school or in your town. 

Having worked on a college campus for a few years, I can tell you that the first few weeks are always the hardest for new students. It will pass.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. Go to a movie. Volunteer to walk a dog at a local animal shelter if animals make you happy.",houston_veronica,1538941524.0,2018-10-07 14:45:24,"I'm so sorry you feel this unwell, and as someone who truly understands the horror of AN, I can completely get why you're doing these things. There's so much crap flying around in your life right now. 

The first thing: breathe. Please breathe and stop.blaming.yourself.  You have the #1 most deadly mental illness, so show yourself some grace and allow yourself to quiet that voice that is angry for falling prey to this insidious illness.

&amp;#x200B;

Second: do not give one second of thought to foods that are ""good"" vs. ""bad"" - eat what you can, eat plenty of it, and most of all, get the ever-important fats and proteins your body is screaming to have. That will HELP your brain. I promise, things are so dismal because you are starved. The only answer is to eat - there is no distraction, no good activity, nothing that can fulfill what eating RIGHT NOW will do.  I know it's hard, I just put on a lot of weight to restore from what was once skeletal.

Life is so much better when you realize that:

1. Your mindset is truly warped when starved. Even if you can focus on school, concepts, whatever...you are not seeing reality in how you view yourself, your portions, and what it means to be mindful in your exercise.
2. Exercise is not required to be healthful or slim; movement is a good thing, but you can be literally any size with or without exercise. Stop compulsively forcing yourself to do something that is just furthering your fear. 
3. Exposure to your fears is the only thing that will help you beat them; it's scary to eat a proper amount, it is scary to not exercise, and it is scary to not ""identify"" as ED'd. But when you finally try these things, you will see that you were afraid of completely nonsensical things. Eating properly is a need for life, and you will NOT GET FAT. I promise.

Ask her this question instead of a bunch of strangers on the internet. Every ED is different and different people are triggered by different things. Expressing to her that you think she's beautiful at any weight, don't think her gaining weight is a problem, etc, could have the inverse effect that you're hoping for.

&gt; I have a background in Psychology and I...

Resist every subtle urge you have to try and diagnose her. Since you don't know whether or not she even has an ED (her behavior _does_ sound like disordered eating, FWIW), you could mention that you think food and eating preoccupy her enough that it's worth talking to someone. Her working through it on her own with a professional would be most optimal. Then, once she knows where she's at, you can support her however she needs.

It definitely sounds like an undiagnosed ED to me. It's really unfortunate that she's in denial about this, because that makes everything so much more difficult. I'm struggling with an ED relapse right now and I can't even imagine what it would be like for my partner if I weren't able to be honest about the problem and if I wasn't actively working to fix it. It's hard enough as it is. 

I think I'd be really straightforward here and tell her, ""I'm really concerned that you don't eat enough. It makes me worried a lot of the time, and that has a negative effect on our relationship."" Focus on how it is for you rather than on her behavior. How it makes you feel when she only eats one bite at dinner or when she panics because she feels she's eaten too much. 

Learning that this disorder makes things challenging for the people we love can be really eye-opening. When you're actively engaged in an ED you're kind of trapped in your own bubble. It feels like you're only hurting yourself. It was hugely helpful to me to realize that I was hurting my loved ones; it's still one of the few things that motivates me to do well with eating even on my toughest days.

I would say we are in kind of a similar situation.
I stopped calorie counting around the time I started Uni, 3yrs ago.
Restrictions were a bit trickier for me though.
I had and still have a problem telling a restriction from a health decision. (I really like healthy foods, but also like candy)
For example, I wouldn't eat candy, a lot of bread or put sugar in my coffee because it's not healthy. Yeah right. Most of the time, I knew deep down that it's an old anorexia habit and that I'm scared of gaining weight.
With time I figured I have to listen to my body. Eat a lot of whole foods, vegetables, fruit, meat and STOP with the restrictions.
When I would restrict candy, I would spiral into obsessions again. I would count how many days I haven't consumed sugar, if I did, how much, I would have CRAZY cravings etc. And then I would have a relapse and eat a lot of candy in one or two days. I physically couldn't stop myself. I was really stressed and nervous.
I had to stop thinking about food in a mathematical way. I am still in the process of it, but I feel easier. My mind is more at ease and I don't get crazy cravings. 
I don't know if I can give advice really, but this is what gets me through life right now.
Everybody says this, but, accept your body. Veeeery slow process, you won't feel like you're making progress, but trust me, it's the foundation of everything. Your will to get better is the most valuable thing you have.
Also, eat home cooked meals with friends/family. You can prepare something, your friends can, or your grandma...whatever. Food is not the enemy, it can be fun and a sign of appreaciation for a person you are cooking for.
I have 2 best friends with whom I often eat together. Eating home cooked meals in company helps me a lot. Especially soups. They are nice and warm.
I try to recognise disordered eating habits and eliminate them. Easier said than done. But if you know deep down what you're doing is not healthy: recognise it, ask for help and don't beat yourself up for it too much. The most important thing is that you're aware of your situation and not afraid to ask for help.

During last year I often felt that getting back to anorexia would be an easier solution for me, but it's just your stupid brain playing tricks on you.
When that happens I always remind myself of this:
When I was anorexic I was miserable. Weak. Tired.
And the worst of all. Sick.
It took me a lot of time to think about EDs as sicknesses.
When you have the flu, you probably don't go around like you're healthy, right?
So, when you have an ED,you need to be extra nice to yourself and nurture your body. Remind yourself of that.


P.s.
Everyone, please correct me if I'm wrong! I don't want to give bad advice to someone in a delicate situation!!!",AlcatK,1539869708.0,2018-10-18 08:35:08,This is some of the best/ most resonating advice I've read on here. Thank you.,Bo-FoSho,1539902777.0,2018-10-18 17:46:17,"If you think you can recover on your own, of course that’s an option. But asking for help, support and professional guidance is something I would really recommend. Maybe an outpatient program if you qualify and have the insurance. Same thing with getting a dietician and therapist, 100% ones specializing in ED’s. (As a less intensive option) One of the biggest things for me was having a meal plan, where I had someone tell me the correct amount of protein, grains, etc that I needed to eat for each meal, and then just eating it. After, I would be so full too. It was triggering, so I would always nap afterwards so I didn’t have to deal with it, until I was able to not feel full. Couple that with the mental work you need to do of getting yourself to feel deserving of recovery, and tackling the reasons you fell into your ED were the second hardest, but it’s so important. Some things that really helped me were taking labels off of food, or eating places that I couldn’t see the calories. And then positively affirming myself for not looking and just living. Just allow yourself to NOURISH your body, and enjoy the taste of the food that you like. The reason I was able to kickstart this is from being impatient, where I ate in a cafeteria and had no way of looking at calories. Taking tags off my clothes was another thing. You seem steps ahead given the fact that you’re willing, ready and able to kick this thing in the ass. Honestly, you should be SO proud of yourself, and realize that the fact that you want to do this for yourself is the most amazing thing you can do.

A therapist  should be the one who challenges and holds you accountable, while a partner stands by you through those challenges. 

Maybe take some time to think about what support looks like to you.  That way, if he asks how he can help, you'll have a ready answer.

&amp;#x200B;",heartshapedsprinkles,1539789506.0,2018-10-17 10:18:26,"My story is a little different, in that I was unaware of my ED for the first 8 years of my relationship, as it was my ""normal"" for most of my life. Diet culture also helped to mask my ED. The truth is, we'd been together long enough that deep down I think he already knew, in a sense.

This past year it started to get worse, and that was when I had my own realization that I had an ED. I kept it to myself for a few months, hiding the parts I was more ashamed of from him. He's perceptive though, and caught on rather quickly, and began to (gently, and kindly) express his concern.

I had been able to ""rationalize"" it to him for a bit, but I finally had a moment where I realized it was getting progressively worse, and that I wasn't getting better on my own.

So, we were home together one weekday evening and had just finished dinner, and we were cuddling on the couch together watching a show. That meal was a struggle for me, so I finally decided, ""You know what? Screw it. Hiding it isn't helping me, and he's going to find out eventually."" 

So, I turned to him and told him just that. I prefaced it by letting him know it was something very difficult for me to talk about because I was incredibly ashamed of it, and that I had been fearful to talk to him about it because of *my* own shame; I made sure he knew he had done nothing to make me feel that way. I told him that I'd done lots of my own research, and that I was pretty sure I had an ED that was getting worse. I had looked up a nearby therapist that specializes in EDs, and told him I was going to make an intake appointment with her.

I was very honest with him about the whole thing, and I laid out my plans to tackle my ED with professional help. I told him that I want to be healthy, and I was willing to put in the work to get there. (There were tears in my part for sure, so I made sure to keep a few tissues handy!) He has been incredibly sympathetic, understanding, and invaluable when it comes to my other physical/mental health issues, and he continues to do the same with this one. 

After the dust settled and I became more comfortable talking about it with him, we started trying to figure out ways for him to help me at home. I think part of the struggle for him initially was that he didn't know HOW to help, and together we're coming up with things he's able to do to help me. I think feeling helpless is something a lot of neurotypical partners go through when they're with someone who isn't ""normal,"" and helping them help you can make them feel like they're able to do something for the person they love.

Because he loves me, y'know? He fell in love with me while I had an ED (along with a veritable laundry list of other health problems), and that didn't make me any less worthy of his love. Just like you're not any less worthy of love and support! :) And we met and fell for each other in a way similar to y'all; we both knew within just a few weeks that we were going to go the distance.

I hope that helps! I wish you luck in telling your partner about this. One thing that helps me is thinking that, if the situation was reversed, would I want him to tell me? And the answer is always yes.",anjalivalentine1,1539804025.0,2018-10-17 14:20:25,"I told my current boyfriend about my eating disorder pretty much a few weeks into dating, though in our case we had been friends for years before dating which made the conversation easier. It actually helped a lot having his support when I got into treatment a few months later. If you really do feel like this is the dude for you, being honest (even when it's difficult) is always best. Real relationships are about accepting you as you (and vice versa), not some other idealized version of you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also learned in treatment that ED's thrive their best off of secrecy/the resulting shame or disgust you feel with yourself. If I had to guess, that's probably why you make progress in secret, only to end up going back to the cycle. ",curlyqchicago,1539967409.0,2018-10-19 11:43:29,"Hi. I was 25 when I told my SO. It was the most painful and traumatic event in my life so far and eventually the most relieving and helpful.

You have already received helpful comments so I will try to be concise. 

*&gt;  I’m ridden with so much shame, disgust, embarrassment and hate for  myself because I feel like a huge disappointment and fuck up. I want to  be normal so badly for him and everyday I’m trying to make progress  secretly, and I do, but then the cycle just continues and spirals  downward aga*in. 

This is 100% how I felt. Those feelings of shame pumped through my body in 24 hour intervals.

**Here's my story:**

I trickle-truthed him. Dropped some truth bombs every now and then but reassured him it was okay. He knew some things; polished truths, mostly due to my denial, mostly because I wasn't ready to show him the full picture. I would cry over bread or chicken or what have you and he would rub my back and nod his head silently. I would feel relief when I told him and then sharp shame and raw regret an hour later. I thought that meant I was being honest with him-- I told him the chicken strips gave me anxiety-- what else is there to say?? 

Then we moved in together. Suddenly, I could not hide the habits and bumbling denial I had. My moods were more apparent. My staring at walls and empty plates were loud and clear. I'd be upset over 1/4 cup couscous and need him to comfort me.

He asked me to see a therapist. He sobbed when he pleaded with me. I had never seen him cry. I waited 10 months to see a therapist (why didn't he schedule it for me?! He knew this was hard for me?!). After 14 years of ED, I saw one. I felt better. I told him. I apologized for putting him through hell, for making him be my intermittent therapist. I realized how much the ED is destroying my life. And his.

He, the love of my life, then broke up with me. He said it was too late. He had been resenting me for months. The image of me he had had been ruined. He was sick of my moods, sick of my inability to tell him what I was thinking about, my crying, my problems etc. The feeling I had when he said those words will never leave me. Shame, regret. Confusion.

I had to face 14 years of trauma, of existential displacement, of anxiety, of depression, of everything. I don't even know how to explain the tangents upon tangents my eating disorder affected in my life. It affected me physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, sexually, my hobbies, my personality, my career, my family, my friends, how I go to the bathroom, how I sleep, how I feel good, how I feel bad, everything. Why did I expect my relationship to be okay? I expected him to fix me. He made me feel better. 

Him leaving me opened up my eyes to my denial. I was bathing in it. I scrubbed myself with denial every day for years. I never had to deal with my eating disorder because I was so good at hiding it from everyone. I couldn't with him. And it tore me apart. 

We just had our 4 year anniversary. We had to work through a lot of things. I had to work on myself. I've had to see therapists and be honest with him. I had to be honest with myself. He had to see the real me, flaws and all, and still come back and say he loves me. We haven't had a fight in more than \~2 years. 

I am more recovered, happy, free, and relieved than I ever thought possible. Him breaking up with me saved me.

**How I would tell him:**

There is no good way in telling someone this. I would suggest being 100% honest. 100% your feelings. 100% ""I'm scared this will affect your perception of me"" 100% ""I feel so shameful"" 100% ""I need to see a therapist and I am working on it"". I think the news would be received better if you had a plan (i.e., therapy) and not so much dumping baggage onto his lap and framing it like ""take or leave it, bub"". 

I think you're afraid he will lose trust in you but you don't trust him to take the news well. Trust takes time, unfortunately. It took me over a year to trust my BF didn't think I was a disgusting asshole with an ED. Him standing beside me over the years made me trust him. His actions did. Trusting someone takes a leap of faith, I think. So allow yourself to trust he will be okay with the news. You can't tell him and automatically go into depression/ED autopilot thoughts of ""I'm worthless and he is lying to me"". 

Maybe write a letter? I'm 28 now and think about if I had to date someone new....how would I do it? I would have to rip the band-aid off. Writing helps me say everything i want. I guess you have to allow your partner the autonomy to digest this information, understand it, and still come out on the other side. Allow him space to understand what you are saying. Allow him to ask questions. Allow him to be frustrated at first. But communication is 90% of the battle, I think.

I try to think if I was on the other side of this. I would want to know my partner is trying. That's all. Trying to take steps in getting better. I was so deep in denial I didn't realize I was drowning. Hindsight is 20/20.

Ehhhhh that wasn't concise at all. Sorry. Good luck. Shame and regret hides in shadows. Remember that. Shine light onto the problem. I promise you there is another side to life and bulimia. I promise. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your psychiatrist is DEFINITELY not trained in Eating Disorders nor in Trauma therapy if she is dismissing you like that. Sadly, she missed the memo that ED affects people at every weight and size, not just those who are under or over where the scale ""should"" be. She may not think she is causing any harm to you, but she is. She is invalidating you and making you second guess your instinct. And I believe your instinct is spot on--this is a recipe for relapse. 

You may want to look into finding someone who is trained in Eating Disorders, not just a general psychiatrist. Look for trauma therapists, if you have insurance try using their database to locate someone. You can try the https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/ website to see if they can be of some assistance as well.
Another option would be to find a Registered Dietitian who specializes in Eating Disorders. They are harder to get covered by insurance, but are invaluable.

To answer your question:

1. There are calorie calculators ([https://www.freedieting.com/calorie-calculator](https://www.freedieting.com/calorie-calculator))to figure out how many calories you need to stay alive. Eat below this number, you lose weight. Eat above it, you gain. I'm not trying to be condescending but some people actually don't know this. 
2. Make an account on something such as [myfitnesspal.com](https://myfitnesspal.com) and log your food. Select 'maintain weight' when making your profile...given that he's not already underweight
3. If you wanna find out if your under, alright, or overweight, go to 
4. Log your foods everyday to give him a visual representation of how he's not gaining weight, while also making sure he doesn't lose any, if under-eating is/becomes an issue. 
5. Always put therapy on the table. Therapy for this is usually a dietician and mental health counselor together, both of which are far better equipped than you or I to sort out the underlying issues causing this.

I think many people hold the idea “it’s not me, I can’t help it, Im sick.” That’s still you though, no matter how much you want to dissociate from your body and pretend like it’s someone else. And OWNING your story and actions is the hardest part. “You” aren’t what you want to be, you aren’t just the feel-good parts of yourself, you are what you do, all of it.

I did this to myself. I hurt myself. I caused my own prolonged suffering. It ultimately doesn’t matter if it was a result of mental illness, the cause does not negate the material consequences of my actions. And now I get it and now I can move forward.

— “Guilt is not productive, it’s self-pity. Change is the most effective and honorable apology.”

This realization was a relief and freed me from obsessing over being a burden. As long as I am trying to be better, there is no guilt or at least I can push through it.

—“Feelings aren’t actions.”
I mean this in several ways. Wanting to recover is not an action. Lamenting your situation is not action. Getting a task completed is an action.

My second meaning is that, in a mind like mine which is obsessive, feelings and urges can be overwhelming. But they are just information, they can’t make me do anything. I can feel overwhelming guilt at wanting a cookie, but reminding myself that guilt isn’t productive and that feeling that urge doesn’t mean I’m going to eat the cookie is comforting enough to help me move past the scenario.

I agree with the other poster who suggested seeing a dietitian and, if possible, a therapist. 

Because you mention control, it's hard to determine if what you consider a binge truly is one or if it just feels like one and is actually what your body needs, especially if you're strict with your diet throughout the week. Most binges are driven by both physical and emotional needs, though some people will lean more one way or the other. If you're not getting the right nutrition, not just calories, your body may be craving food in general by the end of the week. This is where a dietitian can be helpful. The two of you should be able to create a loos meal plan that will help you feel more nourished throughout the week. This might also help with the excessive fatigue you mention. 

It seems like you are very hard on yourself. You are taking on a lot, so working on healthy ways to handle the added stress in your life would be helpful, too. 

Relapses are normal in recovery but they are really learning experiences, a red flag to let you know that something needs to be addressed, and the fact that you are aware of something not feeling right to you is a good sign. You reached out before things got worse, so give yourself credit for committing to your recovery. It's not easy to ask for help and be honest about what is going on in your life, and you have the courage to do so. That's something that will ultimately help you as you continue to heal. 

I hope you can get the support you need. Make sure to be gentle with yourself. ",bladesman393,1540423984.0,2018-10-24 18:33:04,"This is a long post, so I hope you don't mind me picking out some quotes and responding to individual bits, I think you deserve a long answer :)

&gt; So I am currently experiencing some relapsing problems with binge eating, 

It might not sound like much, but I prefer to think of the times when we regress a bit as ""lapses"" and lapses do not necessarily mean relapse. If you believe you have relapsed from the get go, you might give it more power than it truly has.

&gt; but the situation I am in now doesnt really let me control as much as I'd like to so I am here now..... 

Can you elaborate on this? The 3 core factors in recovery are Hope, Control and Opportunity, so I am curious about what you are not currently able to control. Is it that you physically cannot control something, or that you are struggling to control something because of how you feel?

&gt; I tend to have one day in the week where I allow myself to eat what I  want, not for the whole day, but sometimes I start eating something and  it continues and continues. I let myself do it at least once because it  gives me satisfaction just being able to be chilled out and eating while  watching a show 

This is good, it is important to not forbid anything, as forbidden foods can leads to urges that become impossible to control, but if you allow yourself to have things you want you are less likely to exaggerate with them.

&gt; I am really worried and I'd really appreciate some help from those who  have recovered because I don't know if these relapses are normal 

Lapses are totally normal. There are two types of people who have control over their eating disorder; those who have recovered and those who are in recovery. I tend to lean more towards being permanently in recovery, this makes the lapses more acceptable, because we cannot be perfect all of the time... Is there any chance you can move closer to your Uni? That is a really long commute, if this is at all possible I am sure it would give you more time to be able to go to the gym. Also, how much time left on your Master's? If it is until the end of the academic year, then maybe its ok, because afterwards you won't have the same long commute and you can have more time for you.

I don't want to diminish what you have said OP, but I feel like you are worrying too much about this perhaps. You feel like you *should* be doing better, but maybe you are just doing the best that you can. You have a long commute and lots of social activities, so I believe you are making the best of your situation. If however you feel that things are really bad, see what things you can change in order to be able to focus on you. Perhaps find a gym close to your Uni so you can go before or after classes and then come home after? Best of luck with the master's, take care :)

Eventually, I was only eating 1 small meal a day, max. At the beginning of my sophomore year, I went in for my physical and my doctor freaked out about my weight and insisted I make an appointment with the dietitian at student health. Shortly before that, I'd started taking antidepressants and going to therapy, which definitely helped me feel better. My dietitian (who I still see once a month a year later) has been instrumental in helping me reframe my thoughts around eating and figure out how to provide myself with adequate fuel while only eating dining hall food. 

Even if you don't have an ED, I would check and see if your student health clinic has a dietitian who can help you figure out why you aren't eating and what eating plans you can make to give yourself enough calories.

Is there a way he can learn how to be more supportive instead of dictating what you ""should"" do? 

Humans in general like to move. It's a scary place to be in when you're unsure if you can exercise in a healthy way, but recovery isn't big black and white thinking. It's all about the gray areas. Being healthy isn't eat and don't exercise or exercise and restrict. It's something in between. If you are at a healthy weight, he might be concerned that you are not happy where you are and talk about losing weight. Try to make the exercise about feeling good, not weigh loss. Maybe start with something like yoga instead of running, too. It's a little less strenuous but still allows you to move and get some exercise. 

He might see how easily it can be for those of us with eating disorders to go from being healthy to sliding into unhealthy territory. Maybe you could work with someone who can help you come up with an eating and exercise program that would be sensible and healthy. 

The most important thing you addressed is getting support. We all need some feedback and guidance now and then. Isolating or relying too heavily on one person doesn't give you an accurate look at how things are, and for those of us who often have a distorted view of ourselves, getting support is essential. 

Maybe you could look into free support groups or find a dietitian you could work with. Ultimately, this is your decision. It's nice that your boyfriend wants you to be well, but wellness includes your mental health and well as your physical health. ",kyyypa,1540265173.0,2018-10-22 22:26:13,"I second what a previous commenter said about your boyfriend not supporting you when he tries to dictate how you should behave/labeling what those behaviors mean for you, and how a huge part of recovery is finding that balance for yourself where you're engaging in movement activities and eating foods that you enjoy, *without* ED symptoms.

My brain is feeling all over the place right now and I can't tell if this is coherent right now, but I'll try! Feel free to DM me if you'd like additional support or to talk about anything ED-related.

I have struggled with an ED since 2011, but felt mostly recovered (no engaging in symptoms, just occasional ED-like thoughts) since 2016. Recently however, my life situation changed to where I don't have friends or family where I live (nor my partner unfortunately, so a similar situation to you). Since my partner moved, I have been working really hard at eating more comfortably for me than I was when he was in charge of meals (due to scheduling/time/he loves to cook), exercising most days to elevate my mood and do something I genuinely enjoy, and all the while *not* ceding power to ED thoughts triggered by these sorts of activities. It's a work in progress, but for me personally, weight loss specifically can never be a goal that will be healthy for me, no matter how I feel about my weight. Coming to that realization, for me specifically, was very powerful, and helped me to construct goals that encourage me to enjoy the things that I love but not make it about weight. For example, one goal I have is to dance every day (except Sunday), because I love to dance so much! It also is a cardio exercise that engages the whole body -- which is nice for movement -- but the goal around wanting to dance every day (whether 5 or 30 mins) is not centered on weight loss at all.

My partner has also gone through various ""methods of support"" in the past six or so years we've been together, and some looked like what you're describing with your boyfriend and felt really quite negative to experience. I have personally found that the most helpful thing was directing him to resources on supporting a partner/significant other with an ED (or more generally ""enabling"" vs supporting/empowering), making sure he talked with his own therapist/support system about it if he was able, and when I could vocalize explicitly what *was* and *wasn't* helpful for my recovery (which I wasn't always able to articulate), being sure to let him know. Things like, ""I know you mean well, but it does not help me when you say things like X. Here is a way you *can* help me, or something that is helpful for me to hear when I want to do Y"", seemed to resonate with him and made me feel more supported. I think it's important that you let your boyfriend know how you feel (if you're able) and remind him that he does not get to determine what *is* and *isn't* healthy behavior for you.

Wishing you all the best -- it's totally OK if this comment doesn't land well with what you're experiencing or isn't ""right"" for your situation, but we're here on this thread for you to turn to and you're not alone in this. ",bladesman393,1540301793.0,2018-10-23 08:36:33,"I'm glad you made this post OP, it is important to have some kind of separation between Church and State so to speak, and by that I mean not having your sole support be your partner. Partners care a lot, but the problem with that is it can lead them to try to **do** too much. When I trained to support people suffering with EDs, I learned about the two kind of supporters, the Rescuer and the Insight Creator. The rescuer will do everything they can for you, be it monitoring food for you, or supporting you at every turn. This is what a partner does, but if that is the only support then you might depend a lot on them. I met a woman recently who had her ED under control because her husband helps with food and makes sure that she eats and so on, but he has had to move away for a job and now she is struggling. The Insight Creator will try to give you the tools to help yourself, without overstepping boundaries. The Insight Creator gets you to think about things you can do to manage things day to day. Therapists, dietitians for example are Insight Creators.

Have you had much experience with therapy? Do you think it might help? Do you have an underlying cause for eating difficulties that you think could be improved with therapy? What is your social life like, do you have many friends you can do enjoyable activities with? If not, websites like [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) can be really good for finding things close to you that you might enjoy. However you look at it, overeating or undereating are both a form of self medication for feelings of unease. Sometimes it goes on so long we don't even know why we do it, because we have built it into another piece of who we are. Ultimately the control has to come from you, and so it is important that you start to do more things that are just for you, and I hope that in time this helps you find some peace.

It's important to use ""I"" statements. ""It concerns me when you talk about losing weight,"" or ""I'm worried that you have been losing weight.""

About a year ago we had a big fight over just this... she kept confiding to me in how depressed she was, crying every day, etc. I wasn’t handling it the best, I kept pushing her to get help. She told me that when she talks to me it’s not because she’s asking for advice so she doesn’t want to hear any. 

This was the last time I brought up paying for CBT (I have a well paying career, she’s in school still). When she refused I was frustrated and told her that I don’t know why she’s telling me all this but then refusing to get help for it (trying tough love). It didn’t go well. At that point she essentially stopping talking to me, we were superficially friends but no longer texting or confiding. That only ended when she broke up with her 10 year boyfriend after he cheated with multiple people - that was the trigger point for this entire new eating problem.

Since all this my approach has usually been to acknowledging her pain, then try to steer the conversation to make her laugh. I don’t feel like I can have a conversation any deeper than saying “that sucks buddy”... it doesn’t seem to be allowed.

Again, trusting the process is important. Leaving the nutritional plan to them will allow you to take care of yourself and work on the road to recovery. 

Keep us posted on how you do, your story matters. Good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They can assess the level of care and support that you need. A lot of it can feel like mechanical eating and sometimes depending on your ED history, normal hunger cues can be out of whack and you actually have to start eating regularly again for a while for those hunger cues to come back. 

It may also help to meal and snack prep on Sundays for the whole week. There are a lot of portable snack options available. 

Also, I am not sure if you are having digestive issues or slow stomach emptying, feeling bloated, stomach painb, acid reflux, feeling full very quickly etc, but they gave me Reglan in the hospital before meals and it really helped.

I luckily didn't injure myself permanently with overexercising, just had to take a break from working out to heal, but I caused myself some serious gastrointestinal issues to the point that I have to take medication 3 times a day to not be in pain. I've got another friend who lost her gallbladder from her ED.

There are times when I feel frustrated and angry at what I've done to myself. What's helped me a bit is to remember the way I was before my ED: I always knew, in the back of my head, that I ""should be"" dieting, that I ""should be"" eating X calories a day, that I could start fasting and lose weight if I wanted to. I was like a time bomb.

So the way I see it, the shit I went through with my ED was worth it if I can use it to get those thoughts out of my head, to get the obsession with weight loss and calories out of my life for good. It could have been much worse for me than some stomach problems. Use your injuries as a reminder to never go back to the place you were at with the ED.",lizefb,1541129481.0,2018-11-01 22:31:21,"I can definitely relate to the pain issues. 

One thing that one of my mentors once told me is that you can't go back, so the best option is to take a look at where you are and then, from there, try to realistically imagine where you want to be. It's easy to get stuck in the past, and moving forward doesn't mean shutting your past completely off. Try to focus on the here and now, though, even if it means describing the pain you feel. Working through the emotions of frustration, sadness, and anger will help you accept where you are now. It's about having compassion for yourself and both acknowledging and healing the past, not just ignoring it to move forward. There's a good chance you have to allow yourself to grieve. 

Have hope, though. You might not be able to go back to where you were, but you can create a new and different future. Writing about your goals and getting in touch with other aspects of yourself can be healing and help prevent you from going down the spiral of regret. 

My heart goes out to you. It is not easy to be limited when movement has once been a big part of your life. Keep talking about it and reaching out when you need. Allow yourself to grieve but don't get lost in it, even if it means setting aside a certain amount of time each day so you can face the rest of the day unburdened. Allow the emotions, and then do your best to engage in other thoughts and activities.

If you leave  a legacy to a UK charity in your will it benefit from charity exemption - so it's not subject to Inheritance Tax. If you leave it to a foreign charitable or non-profitable body it will be taxed at the prevailing rate (40% / 36% currently, bugger knows what it will be at the point) before they get their money. I recommend speaking to a highly qualified lawyer (emphasis on the highly qualified - look for someone specialised in Wills and Trusts, but a large firm that handles international tax as well, so will be pricier as well I'm afraid). Discuss setting up a charitable trust to leave the money to (the lawyers can advise on different types of trust, with different types of powers of appointment) - that way the trustees have some discretion and leeway to choose the specific beneficiary (research centre - can be more than one) to get the money, so you avoid the issue of trying to choose one that will still be around when you die and you get the charity tax exemption on death because it's going to a UK charity organisation. There are other tax issues to consider, because different types of trusts have tax charges when money enters and leaves the trusts and anniversary charges every X years etc, but I'm not sure how they work with charitable trusts.

Like someone mentioned above, disordered eating examples give a less offensive glimpse into how a relationship with food/exercise can be without a shame factor to those with ED. I went to an ED rehab facility when I was 17(currently 27) and it wasn’t by choice. I’m blessed beyond reason that I was sent there because it saved my life. I was taught life tools that I still implement in my life today. It’s beyond food/image/exercise...addiction boils down to pain, anger, and control issues. When I was active with ED, I was a broken spirit. Restriction, bingeing and purging was my toxic way of having some control in a life that had a lot of shattered pieces. 

What’s tricky with an eating disorder, just like any other addiction, it’s up to the individual to seek help and WANT to make a change. Most individuals know that their addiction is controlling, yet are in denial of how deep they are in it. If someone in the audience is under ED’s spell, this topic may make them uncomfortable but I do believe it’s a topic that should be addressed. Nobody should ever feel that they are not worthy of living life to the fullest because of a number on the scale or a size of clothing. 

Every person in the audience, at some point has had disordered eating behavior. I’m not saying everyone has an eating disorder. To those who don’t understand ED, it makes it more relatable. To those who do, this approach doesn’t single them out. 

One topic I think you should address is that we ALL need positive affirmations. The society we live in is so quick to rip authentic confidence to shreds. Insecurity is an easy bug to catch when one lives in a constant state of compare and contrast. Social media has definitely damaged our view of what is real and what is polished to be seemingly flawless. Nobody is perfect and everyone has something they don’t like about themselves. That’s where the positive affirmations come in. We are not our flesh!! We are all beautifully crafted and the only thing that needs to change is our perspective of what beauty or health is defined by. The skinniest person in the room could be the most malnourished, an overweight individual could have thyroid issues. We can’t judge on exterior factors.

Instead of trying to change the shape of my body, I embraced my strengths and let my strong legs be the way they were meant to be. They carry me up the hills, but they also turned me into one of the fastest downhill cross country skiers on the circuit.

I WOULDN’T be if I was trying to change the parts of me that make me fast. I also started to grow in my relationships, with my friends and with my boyfriends. I finally loved myself, so I could open up and just be me, and I had the power to love others more deeply and feel more connected.

I’m sorry you are battling ED thoughts..good news is...you are undefeated by ED as long as you continue to seek recovery. I wish I could tell you that once you’ve come to a positive acceptance of your self worth that those thoughts go away forever..but  like any addictive behaviors, these thoughts can linger in the dark depths of our emotional departments. I’ve come to accept that some days are better than others. I was once told that life in recovery with ED is similar to taking a tiger out of its cage, walking it around, and then putting it back in the cage. Meaning, you absolutely have control of this beast. The negative body image thoughts have to be tamed and looked into deeper when they arise so that you can grow in recovery. If you let the tiger take control, it will rip you into shreds. 

I also went to an ED facility about 10 years ago and it opened my eyes to how deep this addiction flows. I recommend reading Anorexics and Bulimics Anonymous or Life Without Ed if you haven’t already. Very inspirational reads. When you have these ED thoughts are you going through a stressful period of time or not confronting emotions/pain? 

If you don’t keep a journal of your daily journey, I recommend starting one. It will help to see where you are in this process and what could be triggering you.

Weight fluctuates, our bodies change. We can’t compare ourselves to our past selves because it doesn’t do our current situation any good. You definitely don’t need to compare your current weight to when you were sick because that version of you was never intended to be. If you are healthy, embrace it. Love yourself. Quit being so harsh on your beautiful existence. You are loved beyond your flesh.

At some level, nearly all humans crave attention, but developing an eating disorder usually is not a way for someone to attention-seek. In other words, attention-seeking isn't typically a symptom of eating disorders, unless there is also another underlying mental disorder. 

That said, it may seem like your friend is thriving off attention, but that would be a secondary symptom to the real issues that are driving the illness. 

It's hard to know how to address this kind of question, but I would start by learning as much as you can about eating disorders. Take a look at the resources and videos on the NEDA website to get a better understanding about the causes and treatment of eating disorders before you attempt to help anyone. Set appropriate and healthy boundaries for yourself, and try not to judge or speculate about the causes of someone else's illness. 

I hope your friend can get the support and care she needs. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without knowing your health history or dietary needs, it would be very difficult to offer suggestions about what and how much to eat, but a dietitian can guide you in the right direction. In very general guidelines, make sure you are getting protein, carbohydrates and fats in every meal. A balance will help keep your energy levels at an optimum level. Add snacks between meals. If you're at school, you can bring easy to carry snacks with you to eat between classes.

If she can make it 2-3 days, 3 weeks will be much easier. You should check out r/fasting


I don't think any of your reasoning against her doing this is logical. And why does it matter to her right to do this, that it triggers you, when it shouldn't? 
I don't understand why you're trying to stop her. ",sugarcoatedpotato,1541767867.0,2018-11-09 06:51:07,"First of all, fasting this long in an instant is often going to fail. For normal it is incredibly difficult to keep on. The first week you're going to feel super great, energetic, the adrenaline kicks in. Because your body is hungry af, and wants you to go get/hunt something to eat. This effect is seen as a pro for fasting, because people believe it HAS to be beneficial. That's also the reason why they usually are stubborn about any arguments against it. 

But you are correct, you do not ""cleanse"" your body with fasting, your liver + kidneys do this for you. The stress you put it into is extremely high. 
If she is really comitted to this and says she is completely capable of doing it, you cannot really hold her back, I guess. If you were strugglying with an eating disorder before, you could try and explain to her why this makes you worried and maybe,... maybe she gets it. 

My experience is that people couldn't care less about rational statements and the emotions of others. At this point, your are just focused on yourself, and when you want something, you want it now. As less work as possible. The less disciplin and care it needs, the better. ",sugarcoatedpotato,1541768479.0,2018-11-09 07:01:19,"The thing is, fasting is terrible for the health of your body. And she is right with her arguments against it. If you do only care about loosing weight - good, go on. But don't give that advice to people who struggled with disordered eating before, because that could turn out terrible. In case of anorexia e.g. your brain reacts different to starvation. Whilst normal people get stressed out of hunger and thrive to fix it on the long run, an anorexic would feel that ""high"" you have at the beginning of a fast always, everday from not eating.

I agree with the others that your body's organs don't ""detox"" by fasting. There's no real biological reason for anyone to fast for that long a period. It's not a healthy way to lose weight, and there isn't convincing evidence that it actually helps with permanent weight loss. If she has a specific medical need, short-term fasting under the care of a physician might be advised, but fasting is almost never necessary. 

You're right that drastic fad-type diets or fasts like this won't work. If she hasn't addressed the emotional and psychological reasons behind her disordered eating, no diet or fast is likely to solve the issues. And worse, without knowing her health history, she could be engaging in a behavior that could potentially cause her harm. I would never recommend fasting unless it's under the guidance and care of a credible doctor, and you're not likely to find one who would suggest fasting on water only for that long a period. This kind of long-term fasting could cause issues with her metabolism and can cause some kind of short-term malnutrition in anyone, no matter what her size. 

I hope your sister can get the help she needs. I don'y think there's a lot you can do but be honest with her and express your concerns. ",Dustette,1541785788.0,2018-11-09 11:49:48,"If you get mad, she will just have reason to be aggressive/defensive. Instead on focusing on her unhealthy eating habits, disordered eating, detoxing etc... just ask her about how she is. Is she happy in life? regardless of her body. If she was thin and detoxed, how would that change her life? What kind of permanent change is she trying to achieve by changing her eating?   
I know very little about you and your family and the dynamics of your sister's life but that to me screams ""pay attention to my eating habits so you don't see what is ACTUALLY bad and falling apart in my life"" It's probably a way for her too to channel her issues into something tangible: it's nice to be able to understand something like my issue is that my body doesn't fit into smaller sized clothes rather than something complicated like...

Intuitive eating is a book as well and that has helped me with BED. Brain over binge can also be a great book but it also puts pressure on you to control impulses. You gotta find what works for you, and one thing that I never thought was my problem ended up being my biggest trigger: do not restrict. Don't ever tell yourself you cannot eat or should eat less because you binged, or that you have to wait until noon and not 11am to eat or that you'll eat less of this or that for dinner or whatever... it will snowball. Stop all rules on eating, and just eat. You might gain weight at first, but you'll reach food freedom and life will be SO much better. I started by eating all the things that was on my ""no"" list for years and I did gain a few pounds but I my happiness level has tripled, at least.  
Self-Compassion by Kristin Neff is also an amazing amazing book. I never had a therapist and doing online community work has helped tremendously, especially Recovery Warriors by Jessica Flint. She's got great podcasts too, and a program called ""School of recovery""   
A lot of eating disorders are triggered by loneliness. If you don't have a lot of friends locally (I don't) start talking to people trying to recover too on instagram or facebook, now they're my support and it feels amazing to have people who understand exactly the thoughts others without an ED think are so irrational.

Those with ARFID eat around less than 20 foods overall. Eating foods that one with ARFID can’t tolerate will trigger feelings of anxiety and will most likely lead to gagging, retching, and/or vomiting. ARFID is developed after a traumatic event in a young child. I’ve had ARFID ever since my traumatic birth - however we didn’t know about it because it is such a new diagnosis. The later it is treated, the harder it is to overcome; when treated as a child it can be easy to completely get rid of it or have minor effects throughout that child’s life, but as a a person gets older, there feelings around food are constantly being reinforced, causing a greater challenge to overcome ARFID. Along with the direct food issues comes hyposensitivity, symptoms of OCD and/or autism (but not great enough to be diagnosed with those), and usually General Anxiety Disorder.

Ask her how you can support her. 

Go to the NEDA website and read about ways loved ones can be of help. 

Be sure you are getting the support you need as well, because dealing with and supporting someone with an eating disorder can be difficult.

At home there should be open communication. Since it’s already out in the open she should know that she can come and talk to you about what’s bothering her, but you also need to be able to communicate with her in a constructive way. A school counselor can help with exercises and things you can do together to build trust and openness. 

This is really important with the holidays coming up since they are so focused around eating. This time of year is stressful anyway so your whole family needs to have ways of dealing with this stress so it won’t turn into a huge bubble that bursts into a fight. An activity I used to do with my family was playing board games. I wish we would have done that more because you’re interacting with each other, unlike when you’re watching tv or a movie, and it’s not centered around eating. Finding ways to bond without food being present (like at all) would help her a lot. Personally, I get anxious spending time with my family because I know that the event will be centered around food. It sucks, and I just want to spend time with them without having to worry about eating.

At the time, my disabled little sister was battling leukemia and I wanted to be a better role model for her. Ask her what you can do in the meantime, my mom simply asked me “what can I do to make you feel better right now?” For me, mine stemmed from my anxiety and past experiences I had. You can only go to therapy once or twice a week, it’s really about making everyday better. Sometimes it’s just about going to a movie and keeping her mind off of things. If she has any interests that she wants to pursue, make time in her schedule to focus on things that keep her happy (music, dancing, etc.).  Focus on self-care for her, like bath bombs and face masks.  Skincare became HUGE in my recovery since it was physical stimuli. My mom just holding my hand through it and focusing on the little things really helped me through it. In terms of normalizing and having a healthy relationship with food, eating mostly vegan really helped me because I was proud of what I was putting in my body since I knew it made a positive impact on the environment and I never felt bloated or gross after, even if it was dairy free Ben &amp; Jerry’s. I started cycling and getting fresh air and that helped too. But everyone is different, find out what she loves and envelop her in that. And when she wants to talk, give her a hug and tell her that you’re proud of her. Focus on positive reinforcement. ED recovery takes a long time, it’s like addiction.

They can help you navigate communication with your daughter during this time.  Plus, it's a great way to be a role model for healthy habits and give her a sense of solidarity.  

In the meantime, the most powerful thing you can do right now is just be a listening ear.  I know that the temptation to swoop in and save your daughter is extremely strong.  But behaviors find a way, and until she's ready to actively change, they're not going to stop.

Bulimia is a shameful and dark place.  Nobody wakes up one day and just decides to be there.  Like any other destructive coping mechanism, it fills a void that can't be fixed by physically stopping the behavior.  The first step in the process of healing is simply learning to articulate the thoughts and feelings around the behaviors.  Maybe invite her to start that process with something along these lines:

""I love you and don't want you to suffer alone.  I don't know what it's like, but I would like to try and understand what you're going through.  If you're willing to share some of that struggle, I just want to listen.""

To this day I have fear foods, but i sometimes try to go out of my comfort zone (not everyday because it can stress you out) and eat something I'm kind of scared to eat.

In the end, I found that in the end the best method for me was just to shut my thoughts down. If I tried to “challenge” them as advised, I just ended up in a never-ending tunnel of thinking, and it was really awkward in social situations for me to just go silent whenever food was available. Now, whenever I go to eat something and the little anorexic part of my brain starts up, I just ignore it and distract myself until I forget about it. It gets easier every time, and now I can grab like four brownies at a time and when I feel guilty I go and watch Netflix or something so I can live my damn life. But just remember that it’s always better to eat, life’s too short to get an eating disorder and have to spend months getting doctors off your back so you can get back to normal life.  Hope this helps!",brook-k,1543856365.0,2018-12-03 10:59:25,"This. All excellent advice. I also depended a lot on my internal ITS FINE dialogue in recovery. That, and the mental separation of me from the eating disorder. I was a whole person before the ED, I’d be a whole person when it was gone, contrary to what anorexia had led me to believe. 

OP, I read the quote once that said “feed yourself and fight the illness instead of feeding the illness and fighting yourself.” It really resonated, maybe it will for you as well. 

I highly suggest you reflect not only only what eating behaviors snowballed into this quandary, but also what you might be using the disordered eating to cope with. Restrictive eaters typically exert unnatural control over their intake to counter a sense of fear/helplessness they were dealing with. Sometimes the idea of discipline in eating leads to a distorted idea of what that means about you as a person as well. Ie. “I can control myself around food, therefore I am strong”, or “I can loose weight (or in your case, eat clean)  when others struggle, therefore I am capable”.  It’s hard to stop a behavior you’ve come think is indicative of your worthiness. Plus, when you’re consumed by food planning/nutrition concerns, all the rest of life’s problems and concerns tend to fade into the background. Having that to focus on means not facing the rest. Using restriction to distract me from real life and postpone facing my real issues was a major purpose for my ED. 

In our diet obsessed culture it’s hard to make a conscious choice to be more relaxed. Society tells us that thinness and restrictive eating are virtues. If those things are what make us strong and desirable, what does that mean for us to give them up? That’s why practice makes perfect. Sorry this got really long winded, but essentially I very much agree that you should counter the orthorexia voice with your true self, and don’t take no for an answer. Life’s too short to be afraid of pasta or hate yourself over a bagel. Do something today that your future you will thank you for. Choose self care, freedom and recovery! I believe in you.",a-weema-wehhh,1554911816.0,2019-04-10 10:56:56,"hey, honestly I think making small changes regularly is the best way to do things. you said bread is a food you fear, maybe try buying a brand of bread you feel mildly uncomfortable with instead of going straight for something that will make you feel incredibly guilty then you could have it as a sandwich filled with foods you do feel ‘safe’ with, don’t pressure yourself to finish it the first time but set a small goal. maybe in the next few days/next week try something slightly more challenging. that way you won’t overwhelm yourself with a huge change but you can slowly work towards making the list of foods you can eat bigger again. If you feel you can’t do it alone, then I’d suggest potentially seeing someone about your fears.

I’ve found having a serving of granola with almonds and Greek yogurt - or microwave oatmeal with peanut butter and some dairy fat (milk/yogurt) on the side.

I realized the people I love and care about don’t give 2 shits about what I look like. I realized that being Ultra skinny and fit won’t get me closer to all of my goals in life- academically, professionally, and personally.

My eating disorder gets -loud- at night and I often find myself with a devil and an angel on my shoulders, so to speak. I am similar where I'll ""allow"" a piece of cake, then have an extra bite and FREAK out. Now, I used to immediately turn to a binge because I already fucked up, so why not keep eating and start again tomorrow. So, I completely understand how frustrating this is and the only people that get it are people that have experienced it. I have friends and family that say, ""Just eat like a normal person,"" without realizing just how difficult it is to break out of this process. While I am not yet fully mentally healed from my ED, I am fully weight-restored and have learned how to cope with various things. Here's what has worked for me: 

* With overeating: there's a learning curve here. I can look at a bunch of broccoli or a piece of chicken and tell you EXACTLY how many calories are in that particular serving. I know, to a concerning degree, what exactly one serving of ""healthy"" foods looks like and I know how to tell when my body is satiated when I eat those things. \*However\* I have no goddamn idea how many calories are in a piece of cake, for example, because I NEVER allowed myself to eat stuff like that; so, now that I am trying to recover and eat more intuitively/eat things I wouldn't normally eat, I have no damn idea what a proper serving is or what a proper feeling of satiety is in regard to foods that aren't my ""safe"" foods. Offer yourself an enormous amount of grace. This takes work. 
* Something that I have tried to work on is how I talk about eating food. A big word in the ED community is ""allow."" I ""allowed"" myself to have cake. That automatically sends a message to the brain that this is a treat, something you do not get often. For me, that was an excuse to binge. ""Because I don't let myself have this often, I am going to eat ALL of it."" Nowadays, instead of saying, ""I allowed myself to have some cake,"" I say, ""I had some cake."" Even if you don't believe it, even if you still think to yourself, 'I allowed it,' say ""I had some cake"" out loud. Make it a point to stop saying you've allowed yourself to have something. In this diet-obsessed culture, it's easy to assume that that's a normal mindset to have. You allow yourself a treat because you did XYZ at the gym or had a bad day or it's your birthday. Word choice matters and plays a huge role in one's relationship with food. 
* A trick that has REALLY helped me with the binge, restrict, binge cycle is to tell myself as I am eating a ""fear food"" that I can have this food tomorrow too if I'd like. One of my big issues with overeating was the feeling that I HAD to finish all of the ""bad"" food that day so I could start anew the next day; so I could restrict accordingly to offset all of the ""bad"" food. There was NO way I was going to ""allow"" myself to have cake Monday night AND Tuesday night. It all HAD to be eaten on Monday night. What has helped me is looking at what I like to refer to as my ""alternate universe."" Let's say I have a cookie and then decide, well, I never eat cookies and will NOT allow myself to have any tomorrow so I should eat four more to get this out of my system. In my ""alternate universe,"" I have one or two cookies, save the rest to eat throughout the week, and picture myself enjoying a cookie with tea the following night with no stomach pains or bloating from binging. It was such a big moment for me when I realized that calorically-speaking, it's the SAME amount of calories; but they're spaced out throughout the week and I am able to enjoy one cookie a day versus forcing down five in one sitting just because I HAD to ""eat clean"" the rest of the week. I'm not saying you should base all of this off of calories, but that was a huge eye-opener for me when I realized that instead of eating myself sick and then punishing myself, I could actually enjoy this food all week long without all of the garbage feelings that come from overeating. I've found that by unfencing my days and allowing them to join together as one, I don't have such a black and white approach to my eating and that, the following day, sometimes I don't want another cookie after all. I tried so hard the other day to WANT to eat the rest of the cake I put away after having a small slice the previous night; all I wanted were some blackberries. It's a very cool feeling when you finally allow yourself to trust your body. 

Sorry that this is SO long! I just know how much of a mental battle this can be. The biggest hurdle is stopping the restriction after a night of overeating. That is step one. It's a difficult step to take, but the trick I mentioned above has really really helped me overall.

Eating disorders are like alcoholism in that even when you recover from it, it never ‘goes away’. An alcoholic always has to be careful after recovery. But yes, it is absolutely possible to improve and be well if you seek the help and do the homework.

You can try the online chat on The Butterfly Foundation website for help. I’m not sure what country you’re based in, so I’m not sure what government funded help is available to you.

I know all too well how much like alcoholism this is. I’m reading Brain Over Binge, which bases its whole idea of recovery being likened to an alcoholics’ methods. I can attest to it being just like that.
I’m also working on a book called The Food Addiction Recovery Workbook. All these books have felt very helpful. I just have so much trouble with staying focused on my goals because of my fluctuating (And seemingly no-polar) mentalities.

“You need to visualise the life you want for yourself and put small steps in place to get there. You need to be in it for the long haul.”
I do this repeatedly. After rock bottom, somehow I muster up strength to end this as a problem for me and I get super determined. A week or two later, stress and anxiety has tarnished that determination and by week three, I’m usually spiraling into another low point again. I’m DESPERATE to end this vicious cycle once and for all.

“You need to get food resource books and listen and learn from those who have recovered. “
Brain Over Binge, The Gifts of Imperfection, and The Food Addiction Recovery Workbook have been my reads so far. I haven’t finished them all yet, but I need to. I tend to stop reading them once I’ve grasped their main point, then I think I’m good from there. I’ve got to stop that mentality (along with so many others).

“You need to think about what recovery looks like and means for you.”

When I’m about to fail as in right before I hit rock bottom and wave the white flag? If that’s what you mean, it’s really hard to recall because of the surge of a million horrible thoughts. But most of it consists of my conscious mind far off in the distance (almost a whisper at this point) telling myself where I’m headed, and I can stop it all any moment if I just listen to sense and take control of my actions. Another part of my scoffs at that and instantly shoots it down. “I can’t do that. I’m in too deep. I have to have this NOW. Even if I stop myself I won’t feel any better after passing that fast food place and going home empty handed. I’ll just be even more stressed and depressed that I got no relief from this consuming anxiety. I’ll just be grouchy and snap at Cris (my husband)...” My list of reasons TO DO IT crowd out and drown the voice of reason. I cave and end up with the same results anyway: extremely depressed and suicidal, anxiety to where I can breathe, feeling like failure and an idiot for falling for all this once again. Anger that I fell for that voice for the millionth time when I KNOW it’s wrong.

Off the top of my head, that seems to be the process every time I fail and spiral downward (usually AFTER I’ve lost control of my actions and decisions).",gucci-flipflop,1542127966.0,2018-11-13 10:52:46,"I used to be overweight and struggled IMMENSELY with binge eating. Over time, my eating issues have gone in many different directions, but this was by far the worst, emotionally speaking. Of course, everyone is different, but I will tell you what worked for me.

When I was about 17-19, I went through a lot of changes. My mother had divorced my father when I was 15 and had been dating younger men for a few years. She eventually met a 27 year old Canadian guy who she married, who soon decided that they would be moving 400 miles away (while I was still in high school/living with them, soon to graduate). I felt very lost and alone. I had a part time job and rent was low enough at the time that I could afford a hood ass apartment with a friend, but I felt that I still needed my mom and that she was abandoning me. Maybe I was slow to develop - I know a lot of 18 year olds are 100% emotionally and financially independent, but my mother had me when she was very young and always resembled a best friend and almost a sister more-so than a mother. 

The reason I tell you this story is because it plays a huge part in my weight and eating habits. When I was feeling down and alone, food was there. No one else might have been, but I could go to the store and but $45 worth of food, sit down and eat it all. Of course afterwards I'd feel so suicidal and even more terrible about myself and my life, and I'd try to restrict, but I couldn't seem to get away from the comfort that eating food brought me. Literally the only way I was able to remove myself from this mindset was seeking counseling. I was shy, nervous, and closed off. I didn't really tell them specifically about my eating habits (although I should I have) - I just told them about my life situation, what I was going through, and so on. I was given coping mechanisms that slowly worked in time with a lot of determination and willpower. 

So, in my opinions... You have to be ready for change and genuinely want it. You have to be willing to open up to a professional, as embarrassing as it may feel. You HAVE to be willing to ACCEPT YOURSELF IN THE PRESENT - this might be the hardest part. If you're trying to better anything about yourself, there is a tendency to think ""well I will have the courage and energy once xyz is in place, or I'll love myself once I lose 10lb"". You have to do the LOVING yourself part first. It's not an easy task. For me, it was a lot of reading self help books and watching Lisa A. Romano videos on youtube - unwinding any childhood or adult traumas you have faced. It's a long term project - don't expect recovery to happen overnight. Dedicate yourself to healing YOU - the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.

I still struggle with my body image but I can genuinely say I love myself and take care of myself now. I'm at a normal weight and no longer go on binges. I practice the skills I learned in CBT to avoid these urges - mostly replacing them with healthier habits. It took me 7 years to get to this point. Don't get discouraged. &lt;3",discreetTrex,1542137389.0,2018-11-13 13:29:49,"I wanted to add that it's worth seeing if you can get into an eating disorder center for therapy and nutrition.

And when you fail over and over again you reinforce the belief that you can't change.

Thank you so very much. ❤️,slowbloominglotus,1542144319.0,2018-11-13 15:25:19,"First off, I am so glad that you’re in a much better place now and can love and care for yourself after going through such a terrible background.

I have been going to counseling/behavioral therapy for almost 3 years now. It has definitely helped me to learn about myself, and be kinder to myself. I obviously still struggle with it though.
I also started seeing a psychiatrist recently to help me figure out a drug regimen that will relieve the extreme anxiety I deal with regularly, thanks to PTSD from being raised in a confining religious cult.

I admit, I struggle with the idea of “loving myself”, and really understanding what that means, or looks like when it’s being done properly. I’ve been working hard to stop snide remarks towards myself in my mind, and have come a long way. I’m constantly trying to look at myself in the mirror and accept what I see, yet also explain to myself why the things I don’t like that I see exist in the first place. I’ve always felt it important to be real with yourself and not just brainwash your mind into “you’re beautiful” “you’re gorgeous” “you’re a goddess”. Frankly that just pisses me off. So what exactly do I need to be saying to myself, I guess, is the question I’m stuck on.

Another thing I’m stuck on - genuinely wanting to change, and being willing to change. 
There is no doubt in my mind that I want all this to change. I want to be healthier mentally and physically, more than ANYTHING. But my actions and failures all these years I think have led me to believe that I don’t believe that it’s possible for me. I don’t take the prospect seriously. I don’t know how else to undo that mentality besides proving myself wrong, but that requires being successful at the change - which is the entire problem, and what I haven’t been able to do. So I feel as if I’m chasing my tail in that respect.

I’ve been making myself go to social events to hang with friends - even if it means having mini panic attacks upon leaving those parties, I held in so much anxiety from just being there. I’ve made a lot more friends than I’ve ever had in my life. I’ve made some positive changes - but I feel like they’re fringe problems. I need to figure out the CORE problems that are keeping me trapped in this cycle.

I have done the same. I see a dietician and a psych, both ED specialists who work together.

Are you actually bipolar? If so you need a diagnosis and treatment.

Yes, recovery is ongoing work. You can't stop. It took years to embed these thoughts in your head and it will take years of constant work to undo it. But think of the consequences if you don't. Putting in the hard work now is better than turning around in 10 years wishing you had. I know it's hard.

'“You need to think about what recovery looks like and means for you.” I’m actually curious as to what you mean by this, and I urge you to please explain to me what it does mean.'

What I mean by that is this. I wanted a successful career. I work in a competitive field. I wanted to move cities and have a social life. An eating disorder is fundamentally incompatible with these longterm goals. How can I succeed at work if disordered eating dominates my life and I am sick and fatigued? How can I thrive and have a meaningful job and also be ravaged by a disorder. Maybe I can get away with it short term but over time the disorder will destroy me. And my career. And my goals. I had to want a happy, successful life more than the disorder. Recovery to me looked like travel and a rich career and solid friendships. How can I accept invitations to dinners and brunches from new friends while ravaged by an eating disorder? How can I explore new wine bars and cafes while ravaged by an eating disorder? Again, an ed was fundamentally incompatible longterm with the life I wanted for myself.

I had to work hard to imagine myself happy. Me happy is hobbies and success at work, dancing and rock climbing and long walks on hot summer nights and paddle boarding. Without fear of what others think of me. When I am ravaged by an ED I stop all of these things, don't have the strength. It is incompatible with the life I wanted for myself.

Even today there are days and weeks where I hate myself too much to en gage in my own life. So, quick smart, it's back to the doctor and dietician and psych. I act fast. If I notice myself staying in bed and sad and unable to get motivated that's the first sign for me to act, rather than continue to stay in bed and think about food.

It's hard. I've been fighting 16 years. But yes I am so much better, yes my life is fulfilling [despite the relapses] and yes it has been worth it. I wish you the same, I wish you freedom from this. It's possible.

PS- For me deleting all social media [even reddit sometimes] and not reading comment sections of articles about diet and lifestyle has been essential. Stuff that shit from people who don't understand.

I’m 31 and started being really recovered this year.
I always thought recovery just meant to stop bingeing: no more disordered eating + weight loss. Win-win, right? Well the problem is that telling yourself to stop bingeing is restrictive thinking and leads to... bingeing! I’ve read brain over binge and it helped for a couple weeks and then back at square one. I’ve had my BED turn into orthorexia + exercise bulimia and I thought I was recovering because I lost a lot of weight but actually I just shifted it.
It’s hard to hear but recovery IS NOT ABOUT WEIGHT! You can be obese, happy and recovered.  
I ended up doing an online outpatient program. I’ve mentioned it on here before: the school of recovery by Jessica Flint. You deal with what actually is going on on a deeper level. I’ve had a fairly happy life and I never thought therapy would help me because I couldn’t afford it and I never thought I actually had a “problem” causing my ED. These types of programs are transformative.
What recovered me was letting go of a specific weight to attain, it’s ok to not look like a model and to eat MORE (seems counter intuitive for BED but zero restriction is necessary) while going through recovery. A lifetime of ED never got me long-term thinness, so why not take 3 years to work on recovery to eventually get to a healthy weight without guilt, punishment and tears being involved? 
You gotta find what works for you but Instagram accounts that are supportive have helped me a lot: those about body positivity, intuitive eating and ED recovery. You can PM me if you want to chat more!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It sounds like she went though something major that needs to be addressed. Often dealing with the triggers that eventually led to the unhealthy behaviors will help a person realize the connection. It sounds like she needs more intensive help if she's eating so little and actively restricting. 

Unfortunately, there isn't a lot you can do. You can direct her and those who want to help to resources on the NEDA website or talk to her directly, but if she is in denial, it will be difficult to get her to listen. You can express your concerns and let others in your family know you are worried, too. If she would be willing to go to a therapist, that would be ideal. At this stage, a professional would be the best option, but it all depends on her and her willingness to accept help. People in the throes of the illness can be very stubborn and defensive when others approach them with concerns. There's a fear of letting of of the illness that has become a coping tool, an unhealthy one. 

I agree with the other poster who suggested talking to other relatives to decide on the appropriate steps. Make sure you are taking care of yourself. You might look into Al-anon or read about codependency so that you  don't let her be a drain on you emotionally. 

I'm sorry you are dealing with this. It's a tough situation to be in when you want to help but don't know how. She is an adult, so you can't force her to get help. That's a hard place to be in, but you can create safe boundaries and still support her. ",caitoh13,1542051015.0,2018-11-12 13:30:15,"Unfortunately, diet culture does this to all of us. Often, the compulsion to count starts off as ""health monitoring"" and grows into disordered patterns and compulsions. I had this problem for over 13 years. Do the best you can to articulate your concern to her; leave body-positive literature around the house for her to ""find."" If she wants the help, she will get it. These habits and thought patterns are so instilled in us and sometimes prove incredibly difficult to break. I am a recovering exercise bulimic, compulsive dieter, codependent and alcoholic, and they all played into each other. Anorexia is actually a correlate anxiety disorder, so unless your mom is visibly anxious when it comes to food and eating in front of others, among other symptoms, I'd say this is diet culture run rampant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some good resources for you are the NEDA website, as well as Recovery Warriors. Maybe take a listen to some episodes of the Food Psych Podcast with your mom, to test her out as far as body acceptance and image. Additionally, I write blogs about my recovery that she or you can read when you're ready :)

Disordered eating habits can pop up under a lot of different conditions though. Body image and weight issues are the most common, but plenty of other problems can be at the root of it as well. Anxiety, depression, and yes, phobias. Please try to find a local professional, your GP, or gk directly to a hospital- if youve gone long enough without eating properly, you likely need immediate medical attention and I highly encourage you to get it. 

I know that deep down you know rationally, by not eating, you are making yourself sick. A medical professional can help at least get you physically back on track. They are doctors, and it's okay to place your trust in them. There is nothing to fear from that, so take things a step at a time. But thats the first step.

Our brains are extremely complicated, and if you think about it, it makes sense that a large part of our consciousness would be consistently concerned about food. Are you experiencing anxiety in other parts of your life?
Have you considered eating more fats &amp; lipids? High-fat diets can calm the roving beast that is our lizard-brains working overtime to ensure our “survival.” 
There is nothing wrong with you. 
There is a solution. 
I struggle with this, also. What works is eating a little more than I “think” I need, and then exercising. My thoughts are that I am feeding my body and then putting that energy to use. My body checks those things off it’s to-do list. Food source available? Check. Exercise in response to anxiety or nervousness? Check. Self can relax knowing it has food and then outrun the bear, metaphorically speaking. 
Anxiety from modern life does not translate to our primal neurology and response systems.
Also, if you can, lift weights 🙂
Even just push-ups. Over time you will psychologically learn that food sources are stable and can be generally depended upon, freeing up your focus to see something else. ",paleblueiris,1543017284.0,2018-11-23 17:54:44,"You're not alone in that. I know exactly where you're coming from, but I wouldn't agree at all that thinking about food means you're hungry. I've had the same issue earlier in my recovery though and still do now sometimes.

It's good to set out a list of distractions for yourself so that you have something to turn to when these thoughts are nagging at you, and over time you'll most likely find yourself needing them less. These can be anything you want really, like chewing gum, going for a walk (which gets you out of the house and away from food and might also improve how you feel physically while having a meal settling in your stomach), reading, watching TV, drawing, listening to music or chatting with someone or whatever you enjoy.


As for a more long-term solution, I would try taking up mindfulness/meditation because it improves your ability to control your own thoughts and direct your attention to what you really want to focus on. This is especially relevant to your struggle with staying in the moment as it helps you to be mentally present and able to stop your thoughts from wandering off. There's a specific mindfulness practice which involves training your brain to focus on the situation at hand by choosing an object, sound or sensation and concentrating hard on it for several minutes or longer and drawing your attention back to it each time you get distracted. The idea is to strengthen your brain's ability to divert your attention from unwanted thoughts and distractions. In my experience, this had been so helpful for shutting down negative thoughts. This includes thoughts about food and criticism of my body. It's a skill that you have to build gradually but I reckon it would be helpful for you.

It totally makes you feel like there’s something wrong with you but it’s super normal! Because your body has gone through starvation it is trying to keep you alive for the next time it does. The more you trust you body that will start to taper off. My dietitian and councillor both told me that the more you feed your body that will go away.

""Hard"" doesn't mean impossible! I went through extreme restriction for 4 years (the entirety of high school) and began binging and purging as a result soon after. It continued through my freshman year of college, but I am on an upswing. However, these same thoughts burden me occasionally.  
When these ""food thoughts"" flood my mind I panic - and I think that is the problem. Yes, of course, I try distraction techniques like journaling, reading, focusing on something else, going for a run, etc. but first and foremost I panic. I think ""Oh no! I'm thinking about food again! This isn't good, that almost guarantees I'm going to overeat. I need to stop thinking about food immediately or I'm doomed""  
Maybe your initial reaction isn't so intense, but you get what I'm saying. Recently, I've found that if I just chill out a little bit when the thoughts first arrive, it really helps! As humans, we often tend to get hyper-focused on things that cause us any distress because we want to solve it ASAP or diffuse the situation. However, when we use this method to combat constant food thoughts it creates more distress, more focus, more distress, more focus, etc. (Do you see the pattern?) 

So, to sum this whole thing up: when you get the food thought, don't push it away. Accept it, welcome it! I know that sounds totally opposite of what you'd think, but I promise it helps. It takes away the panic and fear and allows you to focus. Think: ""Ok, I am thinking about food right now. Why? Am I truly hungry? It's ok to think about food, the thoughts will pass as long as my hunger is truly satisfied."" This type of mentality shift has helped me a lot. I wish you the best of luck.

I think this can be a difficult situation for even those who have never had an eating disorder. 

I try to remind myself that comparing outsides doesn't tell you anything about what's going on internally. In other words, the way someone looks doesn't give you an accurate representation of what their life is like. 

It's hard, but try to keep your focus on yourself and how you feel. Keep your attention on how what you are doing affects your health. It would be great if you could share what you went through with a personal trainer. I would hope that anyone in that profession would be understanding. 

As far as your body and its limitations, it sounds like you are already doing a good job of doing what you can to stay active but honor what your body can handle. That's all any of us can really do. Try to acknowledge how far you have already come, especially given all you have had to endure. 

I don't know if anything I've said is all that helpful, but I want you to know that I'm thinking of you and feel like you brought up an important issue that so many of us deal with.

&amp;#x200B;",themissingpen,1542774943.0,2018-11-20 22:35:43,"Hi, OP here. I started out going to physical therapy, with medical professionals that don't usually comment on your body in those ways. I've met physical therapists that do, which is beyond annoying (diet culture is just so pervasive, and as I'm sure you know, it's at least a little triggering whether it's complimentary or critical).

&amp;#x200B;

I want to get into the habit of going to a gym (esp. for after PT), and since I'm unfamiliar with gym equipment/exercises (plus the whole epilepsy thing), I thought I should get a trainer. I've only had one consultation, and there was just too much talk about changing the appearance of my body. Like that is the main reason many people work out nowadays, and trainers are just focusing on that. The people I know that go to gyms are doing it for largely aesthetic reasons, and their conversations are all along those lines. It feels like I'm trying to escape a black hole. I guess I don't know how to (1)  find a truly qualified personal trainer, and (2) broach the subjects of both ED and chronic illness to a stranger like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I do struggle with not comparing my body with others', and you're very right that looking at people shows very little about them. Hell, I have an invisible illness and yet I'm still fixated on appearances. A big part of my ED and self-harm was about making my pain visible, physical, ""more real"" or ""more valid"" in addition to control.

Thanks a ton for your validating words. It's been really hard lately.

*What is essential is invisible to the eye - The Little Prince*",lizefb,1542775768.0,2018-11-20 22:49:28,"I can relate to this so much. A good friend and mentor of mine and I often talk about how hard it is to go to a gym and not compare yourself to others. I found that going to the rec center was better since most people there are really going just for the health benefits, not to necessarily look a certain way. Even still, I have to remind myself that I'm there to focus on myself and my workout, not others or the mirror. 
For trainers, you can find some reviews on Yelp. I think it helps to have a reference, so you might ask around to see if anyone (friends, family, doctors etc.) has any suggestions. Years ago, I worked with a trainer, and I was glad that he responded in a very compassionate way when I told him about my past and my eating disorder. I think it's important to tell a trainer, so that they can better understand your needs and limits. 
It's really frustrating that so much of our society is focused on looking a certain way. It's in our culture and so unhealthy. 
I'm glad you are in a better place and moving in the right direction. It sounds like you have a good grasp on some of the causes of your eating disorder and how to better deal with your illness.

It is weird how shallow this society is... and I can see it, and logically know it, but I don't really feel it.

Definitely it takes work to first accept and then appreciate and eventually love yourself. I think it's something a lot of us struggle with. Exercises like looking in the mirror and repeating positive affirmations are good, not just to help potentially change your thinking, but to help identify and analyze your reaction. If you have a negative reaction, ask yourself why and then where the discounting of a positive affirmation is coming from. 

A rec center is a large facility basically like a gym but more community oriented. They're more geared to the average person, not so much pro athletes or body builders. 

Aww! I love the little prince. That quote in particular is so beautiful, especially in the author's original language.  &lt;3

I was just about to get rid of my scale and full-length mirror, but I was also wondering if that meant I'd have to avoid mirrors for the rest of my life. Or maybe if I take a break first, I'll be able to come back to a mirror in a more rational way. Hmm...

I actually never found those positive affirmation or body-love things very helpful. I'm more in the body-neutral, rational, health-focused camp. That might be a good exercise to try though (sounds exhausting though lol).

I'm all for getting rid of the scale. I did that, and it really helped. Avoiding mirrors isn't as easy. The best way to handle either is to know that a number and what we see doesn't reflect who we really are. That's easier said, of course. Applying it in life is more difficult.

I’ve been struggling with an ED relapse after 4 good years... I’ve had a couple bad months. Do you want to be accountability buddies? I want to be healthy and stop binging/purging.. maybe we could text each other when we’re feeling weak and check in w each other nightly or something until we feel we’re in better places. Message me if you’re interested,vanillamousex7,1543260004.0,2018-11-26 13:20:04,"I understand how you feel, and I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I was diagnosed with a chronic illness two years ago, and went (am going) through the same thoughts! I feel this lack of control over my body has been one of the most triggering events I've had since my recovery (about 10 years ago, with some relapses)

&amp;#x200B;

I decided about 6 months ago to start an anti inflammatory eating lifestyle to help control flare ups and pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a good and bad thing. I'd say mostly good, though.

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with food is the best it's ever been. I feel like I'm nourishing and caring for my body when I eat, and although I sometimes don't consume enough calories.. I'm definitely not slipping that far back into old habits. Also, I've seen a difference with chronic pain, and that for me is the most important thing!

&amp;#x200B;

The bad thing about it is that I've lost A LOT of weight. This is the thinnest I've been in a very long time. I don't weigh myself, as it's too triggering, but my psychiatrist said I'm definitely not underweight, just on the lower side and I need to be careful. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's triggering to hear all of your friend and family talk about how ""thin"" you got. It reminds me of my eating disordered self.. and that's challenging for me 

&amp;#x200B;

The way I control it is by checking in with myself, and being real to myself, and others I feel comfortable talking to. If that little eating disorder voice gets into my head, I fight it. I remember how miserable life was when I was sick. I talk it out with close friends, who remind me how far I've come. I stay away from other triggers as best as I can and focus on the good in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a terrible feeling, to have little control over your body due to illness. It's isolating. You do have control, though. Remind yourself that. You are the one who holds all the power, and you are going to continue living a healthy recovered life! 

&amp;#x200B;

..and if you ever need anyone to talk to, I'm always happy to help! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It must be a pretty hard situation to live for both of you and I am so sorry to read this.

I would strongly advise you to get other people's support when it comes to suggesting your girlfriend to see a therapist or to go to the hospital. I imagine how hard it is for you to see her suffer like this, but it is really important that you keep your ""boyfriend"" place... In my opinion! When you start realizing there is something wrong with the way you relate to food, it is very hard to accept that you actually have an eating disorder, or any specific condition. And I find that the partner is not the person to talk about it, at least as a long-term solution. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is indeed problematic that her friends associate body appearance with eating disorder. As soon as your girlfriend is obsessed with food, whether she is binge-eating, vomiting all her food or abstains herself from eating at all, she DOES have an ED. 

But it is not for you tell her or to handle the situation, or at least you really should try no to do it on your own. Otherwise, the risk is that she will end up avoiding you, even if she shared about her condition with you at the first place. If HER friends are not the best people to talk about this to her, is there someone more ""neutral"", like relatives, or other friends, who could convey the message without making it too emotionnally problematic? 

&amp;#x200B;

It is so great and loving that you worry about your loved one, just don't put too much pressure on yourself to ""make her"" do things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish both of you lots of courage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Don't feel guilty about doing something like that one time, especially recognising it as an unhealthy thing.

What happens is you learn that you have this little life hack that lets you stop feeling bloated and gross when you ate too much - but then you let yourself eat too much more often because you know you can throw it up.... THEN you try to stop and you are used to eating huge portions of food. Trust me it won’t make you skinny, it won’t make you happy at all. The best advice I can give (if you have just eaten too much) is to just go lay down on a couch and let it pass, watch a movie, distract yourself because you will feel better in less than an hour.

Disordered eating can be very isolating, it’s like you’re constantly having a really mean conversation with yourself. For this reason I highly recommend speaking to a therapist for techniques on repairing your relationship with your food and with yourself. The first step for me was knowing my worth well enough to say, I shouldn’t be subjecting myself to feeling this way.  Therapy helped  me get to the point where fighting the urge became more satisfying than succumbing to it and, eventually, purging stopped becoming an instinct. I am way happier now than I ever was purging. I believe in you, OP. You’re stronger than you think.

Much hugs and love. ",kitty_kuddles,1543334366.0,2018-11-27 09:59:26,"Hey girl, congrats on the promotion! 

You deserve to celebrate. 

Take it from someone who has been there: it may feel like by doing this you’re gaining back some control, but you’re not. I agree that you should seek therapy, most importantly because this behaviour very easily can become a full blown disorder. If you ask me, you already display disordered thinking surrounding your relationship with food, and that in itself is a huge red flag. It can be a slippery slope and it is difficult to crawl back out once you slip down. 

My advice: seek therapy, but if you can’t afford that, give yourself time and treat your body better. If you’re feeling out of control, take control of yourself in a positive way, exercise, make a meal plan, but most importantly don’t punish yourself for eating something bad. It is ok. You will not explode if you have cake or pizza once in a while. If it’s not once in a while, change that. But don’t punish yourself, it is not fair. You can do this! 

Use this experience as a kick in the pants to go do something positive for your body, join a class, buy some new weights or something if you can’t afford a class (workout bands are frighteningly cheap and can be highly effective!!), just take it as a signal that something in your life is missing and fill the hole with positive health and body support. You can do it!

One thing that I used to tell myself that works is that Rome wasn’t built in a day: if you want something (anything) worth having that is done, beautifully and skillfully, you cannot do this by taking short cuts, you cannot do this by destroying your body. You can ONLY do this by working hard, and giving yourself TIME for the process to work. ED’s are destructive, they are the opposite of positive self-growth. They do not make us beautiful, less bloated, or happy with ourselves. They serve to destroy every thing we have and care about.

I have also gone through stages where I don’t throw up at all but this disorder becomes a part of you and it becomes hard to stop completely.

Since you've only done it once I would say you have more than enough opportunities to change your thinking and seek counseling from someone about how to improve your relationship with food. Instead of purging, try exploring sustainable healthy eating habits which from time to time make you feel comfortable enough to indulge in some of the foods you crave.

One of the dieticians was an ex athlete, so she understood why I wanted to get fit. But I'll never forget now how she asked ""Do you think you might be getting ahead of yourself?"".

I couldn't even sacrifice 2 months of intentional maintenance for the long term outcome of recover. Well, i didn't succeed in treatment and had to wait 7 months to start again (next week actually).

But that never happened. I've spent 7 months just experiencing symptoms and I'm the exact same weight. Maybe a little heavier.

Now that treatment is approaching so soon I am having huge desires to lose weight and turn down treatment due to the maintenance requirement. I really don't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

Look as many say, yes it is very likely that she likes the attention it gives. In some cases this is our way to be asking for love, for attention, to feel we are cared for, because we have not developed better ways to ask for this, and because we are in a lot of pain internally. I am not sure what is the best approach, it is very individual, if to cut the attention stream or to food her with it. So far I feel you are flooding her so if that is not working, maybe the other way is better.  


Also, be patience, we know we are hurting others and we hate ourselfs even more because of that and it just makes it worse on ourselfs.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, as much as you want help for her, you also need help to endure this process, because is painful, get yourself (if you are not already) your own therapist, maybe one for your parents. You need to be fine to be able to help her. If not you will be in pain and maybe get frustrated and make the issue worse. Like in an airplane, you get your oxygen mask before putting it to others.

I wonder if you could encourage your parents to distance themselves from her a bit — change of environment can be very helpful. Is there an apartment complex or something near home she could move into if finances aren’t an issue? She’s an adult and it’s within your parents’ rights to make her leave their house. It would certainly suck at first and probably leave them with a lot of guilt but I think it would help a lot.

If you’re focusing on losing weight still do your best not to bring it up around her. When she changes the subject to body talk, change it again. AN thrives on comments about food and exercise and weight, so it helps to focus on other things.

See if you can get her involved in a project that has nothing to do with exercise or food. Art, gardening, video games, books, whatever. It’s important for her to have distractions.

Encourage her to keep going to therapy and to see a physician. Is medication an option? It helps some people a lot.

That said, distance yourself too. Don’t make her problems yours but be empathetic. This disease is horrible and sometimes it makes the people who have it intolerable and selfish. That’s up to her to see. Let her know you love her and you are there to support her when she takes steps to improve herself. It sounds like you’ve done a lot of this already. You’re a great sibling and she’s lucky to have you.

Finally, most importantly, put yourself first. You might want to see a therapist yourself to get some professional input. Hang in there. You’re doing great!",emt139,1544196982.0,2018-12-07 09:36:22,"Thanks for this. I’m the OP and this is exactly the way I see it.

I just want to preface this advice with I don’t intend to sound harsh.  It can be hard to interpret tone.

Eating disorders are a family problem.  

Everyone needs help, not just your sister.  Unfortunately, just like no one can force your sister to get help; no one can force your parents to see they are part of the dysfunction (by enabling sister).  They also need to seek out their own professional help.

The most you can do is suggest everyone seek out their own individual therapist (and maybe a family session if it will be helpful).  You can also lead by example—focus on your own well-being, and refuse to get involved or discuss her problem unless people say, “I am ready to seek help.”

I was blinded by so many things when I was ill but now one of my biggest regrets is what I put my family through while I was starving myself. 


It’s very caring of you to worry about your sister and your parents. One thing in my experience with anorexia that seemed to be overlooked by everyone around me  was that it is a mental illness with compulsions and distorted thoughts, not just a starving body. If you read my mind from back then you’d have thought I was crazy because my brain wasn’t functioning normally.


Anorexia is a disorder with a lot of roots in anxiety and trauma. Sometimes starving oneself is seen as a coping strategy to deal with those feelings. Often times this anxiety and trauma is  associated with family problems, over controlling parents, and abuse. How is your sister’s relationship with your parents? Are they strict or overbearing? How does she feel about continuing to live with them as an adult? Does she make her own choices or have a lot of freedom? These are some of the problems that will have to be addressed for her to feel like she has some control over her life.

If you truly want to help your sister and your family recover, I’d suggest family therapy first, even if it’s just your parents attending. The therapist may be able to help your parents come up with strategies to help your sister and perhaps help them change some of their own behaviors that have played a part in your sister’s illness. Maybe if she sees progress, the hope will motivate her to accept help. ",,,,,,,,,,,,

I have put myself and my body through some horrific episodes. I have been there and wish that you or anyone else struggling with this history and habit does not have to go through it, again. It’s such an energy drain 😕
I know it’s hard to reach out when that feeling hits. Feel free to message me if I can lend some support. I’ve been dealing with that form of self-abuse for 14 years. In fact, the longest I’ve gone without BP is probably the past few months. I had to start eating (a reasonable amount, nothing too small but also not nothing) and start incorporating more fats and proteins while eliminating flour and sugar before my cravings and compulsions entered a realm of which I could control.

But it sounds like one of the hard parts for you happens when you're at the store. Can you ask someone to pick up groceries for you? Or try sticking to a set list with one or two treats that are single-portion sized?

For me, it's also a volume thing. So I'll buy healthier foods (popcorn, steamed veggies, sweet potatoes, etc.) that I can ""binge"" on without actually ""binging.""

It helps that I'm a hypochondriac. Not that I'd wish that on anyone, but eventually I stopped binge-purging because was terrified about the damage it was doing to my throat and interacting with my other health issues.

Anyway, I have an idea of what you're going through, and feel free to DM me if you want someone to talk to. :)",rachihc,1544108169.0,2018-12-06 08:56:09,"I am in the same state (in my ED recovery) than you.

In your position I would 1st make a list of groceries that fits my budget for the month (if the rise is permanent or unstable). Maybe ask a friend to eat at their place before going shopping (if possible, you can reciprocate dinner later maybe?) so I wont go hungry and buy only BS instead of sticking to my list.

 And if you still want/need to binge, don't panic, you are taking meds that mess with your appetite, fasting also makes you want to binge, so be kind to yourself.  I would buy at least some to treat myself, because damn, that is a long fast and a lot of stress, treat yourself.

Probably the best advice anyone can give is that eating disorders are about deeper issues, not looks or food directly. Reaching out to a therapist or a group of people can be helpful. 

Eating disorders are extremely complex. If you like, I'm offering a free copy of my eating disorder recovery handbook. I mention it here, because it gets into some exercises you can try around body image and self-esteem.

It might be easier to focus on one issue at a time. Often when you address one like smoking, it becomes easier to tackle the next one. With both, though, it really helps to have support. All addiction recovery is more successful when the individual struggling has a team or network of support. 

 If you would like a free copy of my recovery handbook, you can go to [https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/730896 …](https://t.co/eWS4f6FZY8) create a free account and use the coupon code BE46L for the Eating Disorder Recovery Handbook. The coupon code is good until Dec 27th, 2018. 

Otherwise, try not to be hard on yourself. The more you can learn to have compassion for yourself, the easier it will be to move toward recovery.

Working out can also counter some of the eating and it makes your brain happy. I don't have time to work out right now so I focus on the food side. I make small goals.

Please don't give up altogether on the idea of getting better. It can happen — it's very difficult, yes, but worth it.

Also, I know it feels a little bit good to have comments on how thin you are, but unfortunately, it's just positive reinforcement for your ED. Some of the things I started training myself to say in those situations were things like: ""I'm actually trying to put on some weight"" (even if it wasn't true at the time), ""I'd like to be at a healthier weight, actually,"" ""I know, but I'm not really enjoying it,"" or stuff like that.

 I’m sure these people making comments are probably not aware of why you’re so thin, so just respond by saying you exercise a lot or something.

Try as much as you can to honor your cravings and know that you will reach some kind of nice balance where the hunger is no longer so intense. 

For me, it was best to do both, honor the cravings but still make sure to get some nutrient dense foods (good fats, protein, mineral-dense foods) into my daily diet as well.

The hormones that regulate hunger and cravings are so messed up that they will be all over the place right now.

I’m on my first day of recovery too and how I’ve decided to tackle it is to create a very strict meal plan. This means I don’t have to make decisions about food constantly, which reduces anxiety, and so I won’t feel that my eating is out of control and has no limits.

I have often come out of months of restrictive eating and it has turned into binging because I can’t control my hunger. This time round, with a meal plan of a healthy amount of calories im feeling a lot more positive.

You’re young/ I’m not saying you’re not wise, bevause your struggle surely has changed you in ways but I would highly highly suggest either IOP or IP therapy. 

Being the age you are it’s very necessary to be in a structured program in order to heal. If you can discuss this with a parent or guardian or doctor please do. I didn’t give it my all, ignored when my family tried to get me help, figured I would just deal with it as it came and over a decade later it’s just still so hard. It feels good to make some leaps and bounds towards healing but when they aren’t consistent and with relapses right over the hill, sometimes we all need more help than we can give ourselves. 

My advice, get help while you’re young. Before you’re 26 years old with horrible low vitamin D levels that they can barley fix. I have hernias from fasting that turned into purging- which can only be fixed with surgeries. Pulling muscles and getting strains just from basic exercise at 21 years old because your body will start to deteriorate from ... by that point 8 years of damage. It starts to pile up over time. 
You’re going to want to focus on classes and careers and it is so much harder to do that when you are counting meals and calories and weight in between exams and internships. It’s nearly impossible.

Obviously, I can't diagnose you, but there are a few worrisome remarks in your post, things that sound more like someone restricting than someone who's simply carefree about food and weight. 

I also agree with the other poster who said that your appetite might be affected by your mental state. It can also be affected by restricting or a cycle of restricting/binging. 

I'm glad your weight seems to be in the healthy range, but true health includes both physical and mental wellness. At minimum, I would talk to a counselor or therapist. It might be that this is normal and maybe even healthy for you, but it would be better to figure that out with the guidance of a professional or a team of professionals.

Cheers!",GalaticHippo,1544399389.0,2018-12-09 17:49:49,"You'll want to speak about your lifestyle habits with a medical professional. But to get a general idea, there are quizzes online you can take to test your eating disorder risk level. 

I have binge eating disorder, and it doesn't sound like you have that. BED is when you binge uncontrollably 1 or more times a week for a period of 3 months or longer. Hiding food, lying about food and being unable to stop eating once you start even if it is making you physically sick are all things BED sufferers may experience. 

It sounds like you may struggle with slight disordered eating, such as overeating. I would also look into body dismorphia, which is a disorder where your image of yourself is greatly different than how you really are. For example a really fit person always feeling like they are fat so they excessively restrict calories and over exercise.  

Ultimately you should discuss this with a doctor. If you are concerned your food habits and nutrition are not healthy, you should seek out a registered dietitian or nutritionist. Please be wary of ""nutrition coaches"" and personal trainers, as those are professions that are not regulated by law, and often can give information that can worsen or cause eating disorders or disordered eating. 

Source: I have a degree in nutrition science.

I used to get compliments on things like my abs and chest a lot, but I never liked being complimented because it was just a reminder that they don't understand how I actually want to look and how I *should* look. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried seeing doctors, psychiatrists, and there are no therapists that specialize in eating disorders near me that I can afford. The best thing you could do is find a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. 

I'm no medical professional by any means so take my advice with a grain of salt, but I think you have to really dig deep and take an honest look at yourself. Make a list of your negative emotions and behaviors that are associated with food, exercise, and most importantly, your body image. Try and separate your sense of self-worth from your body image. How would you feel if someone told you can't work out for a month? If the first thing that pops up to your head is your body image, than you have a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard, but doable to overcome something like this, because it's like trying to convince yourself that the sky is actually red. You have a belief that working out will make you look a certain way, and that looking a certain way will make you feel better about yourself, and rejecting this belief is like rejecting that the sky is blue. So how do you go about changing your beliefs? You have to do it deliberately. You have to actively think and tell yourself ""No, OP, I can go this weekend without working out and it *will* be ok."" The obsessive side is in control, but there is a way to stop that obsessive person. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a book I got that is meant for therapists to help their patient with self-esteem, but in a way eating disorders are closely tied with self-esteem. Basically, there's a method in which the patient personifies their bad thoughts as a person, and their good, rational thoughts as another person. 

You can call the person who thinks negative thoughts something like ""the critic,"" and the person who thinks healthy thoughts, ""healthy coach.""

&amp;#x200B;

The critic is the person that thinks and says things like  ""OP you can't miss a day of exercise or else you will get fat."" ""OP you could honestly look better if you just exercised more."" ""OP they're complimenting your appearance but it doesn't mean shit because you could still look better."" 

&amp;#x200B;

The healthy coach is the person you want to listen to and abide by. The healthy coach will say things like ""OP it's okay to take a few days off exercising,"" ""OP you look good, it's ok to take some pride in how you currently look,"" ""OP it's okay to go on that trip and miss a week of exercise."" 

&amp;#x200B;

The goal is to model your thought patterns to be like what healthy coach says. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, you have to ask yourself why the critic tells you these negative things. If the critic tells you something like ""OP what are you doing you can't miss a day of exercise or else you will get fat! Don't you hate being fat??""

You also have to ask yourself why he is telling you this. For me, it would be because the critic is trying to protect me from feeling worthless. The critic is trying to make me feel better about myself by making sure I look a certain way, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Therapy is really the key here, because therapy helps you identify the flaws in your thought processes and restructures it in a much healthier way.

She makes a point to say that it's nothing to do with her weight or looks, but that it's a coping mechanism for her depression (though not exactly in such blatant terms).

A lot of us who develop restrictive eating issues do so because we originally wanted a coping mechanism and a sense of control over something in our lives when so much in our life was so out of our control. Restriction, especially fasting, absolutely gives a lot of us that 'high'. Fasting increases my spirituality 10-fold purely because I feel so good. And once I get back into fasting regularly, the less I want to eat. I hate my body and hate gaining weight, all that. Fasting for me isn't just about weight loss. I feel far better and my defunct body doesn't hurt from trying to digest food. Fasting itself, for whatever reason someone does it, is definitely addicting.

&gt;According to the DSM-5 criteria, to be diagnosed as having ARFID a person must display:

&gt;An Eating or Feeding disturbance as manifested by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs associated with one (or more) of the following:

&gt;1. Significant loss of weight (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children).
&gt;2. Significant nutritional deficiency
&gt;3. Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements
&gt;4. Marked interference with psychosocial functioning

&gt;The behavior is not better explained by lack of available food or by an associated culturally sanctioned practice.

&gt;The behavior does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way one’s body weight or shape is experienced.

&gt;The eating disturbance is not attributed to a medical condition, or better explained by another mental health disorder. When is does occur in the presence of another condition/disorder, the behavior exceeds what is usually associated, and warrants additional clinical attention.

Obviously since we are not doctors we can't diagnose you with anything, but I think it's worth bringing this up with a doctor.

I wish I could tell you what to do, but unfortunately both an interpersonal relationship and an eating disorder are highly intricate things, and I can’t get enough information about any of you from a reddit post to form a definite opinion... 

I will say this, however. If I were you, I would be very hesitant to re-enter into a relationship with her. It’s obvious that you both love and care for each other, but the thing is, your ex needs to recover for herself, not for you or your relationship. She has to come to terms with the fact that she needs help (a therapist is a brilliant way to start!). I fear that she’s become co-dependent on your relationship, which isn’t sustainable, and also puts a huge (and unfair) responsibility on your shoulders, since it’s very easy to feel that “fuck, I’m unhappy, but if I leave her, she’ll relapse.” 

Where to go from here, I don’t know. If I were you, I definitely encourage her to seek treatment or perhaps see her therapist more often/find a new one. Whatever it takes to build up her sense of self-worth so she can take strides to recover. 

I’m also generally speaking not a big fan of ultimatums (i.e. “if we get back together again, you have to seek treatment”) as they can create tension, as well as unnecessary and unhelpful pressure (she might also feel compelled to lie about her progress, which is, you know, obviously bad). Still, it’s a possibility to keep in mind depending on your current situation and relation. 

I would never say that a person with an eating disorder is undateable; I hope that’s not how I come across. But I will say that dating someone who isn’t taking strides to recover from something that is making them fiercely unhappy (as your ex sounds) and which is simultaneously killing them slowly? That’s fucking hard if not nigh-on impossible.

Best of luck to the both of you - I know this isn’t easy. And lastly - trust your judgement/gut. You know your situation the best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idk how old are you, but once a person here posted about their friends calling their mom, and they was pretty pissed off. Some times it is really needed, I understand, but as that person said, it is better to talk directly before reaching to parents. Quite often parents are the reason we fall into EDs. It is very delicate to address the topic for both sides.   


Advice I can give you is : 

1 be there for her to listen, and try your best to avoid any judgement. I try to ask first if the person wants a feedback before giving it, maybe this can work for you. 

 2 reassure her that you are there, that you care and will help her, (we usually are insecure and afraid to loose our loved ones).

 3 try to look up for a couch, counselor or therapist, sometimes we are open to get help, but the process of finding it can be exhausting or we cant put the effort.

 4 Do not push too much and be patience, to get better we need to want to get better, and to be to insistent can be counterproductive sometimes. Ups and downs are totally normal, some days are good and some are bad.

Telling a counselor and making it this big thing might make your friend feel like you've betrayed her trust, and furthermore the intervention by a person she barely knows could just make her more anxious and cause her to recede further into her disorder. Personally, the few friends I know who were ""ratted out"" to the counselors regarding their mental illness loathed it and felt really patronized by the attitudes and actions of the counselors. Honestly, her mom knows (which is the most important) and you should just act as a shoulder to cry on. Let her know you love her and want to support her, but don't confront her about her eating behaviors - that will likely make her defensive and cause her to engage in more hidden disordered behavior (like purging).",AlcatK,1545234346.0,2018-12-19 09:45:46,"Of course this is a possibility as well.

From the sounds of it, she's in deep and confronting her is an extremely tough subject. I have been confronted many, many times and it always ended badly for everyone. It was always offensive because someone with an eating disorder prides themselves on self control. You'd be insulting her and she would view it as sabotage if you encourage her to eat more. This might sound counter-intuitive but you should invite her to a yoga class or a workout class. She needs to have a model of health based on strength and comradery. Tell her YOU want to get stronger and you think it would be fun if she joins you. She will meet some healthy role models hopefully. I notice when women focus on strength they begin to view food as fuel and not an enemy. I'm sure she is very tired since she isn't eating. When you're at the class ask the other women for some protein fueled power recipes and bring them in to work for lunch with enough to share (""Oh Kathy suggested this--you should try a bite!""). My advice is this: focus on modeling healthful behavior. Invite her along to join in under the guise of you being shy or needing a supportive friend to keep at your goal.

That said, from my experience as someone with an eating disorder, the further along and more severe it gets, the more noticeable it is to other people. I have received concerned comments from coworkers. I've been told that I need to eat, and that it's unhealthy to skip meals etc. But here's the thing - *I know that*. 

I know it's unhealthy, but I can't and won't stop until I am thin enough.  Telling me that I'm harming my body doesn't work. I am fully aware at the harm it is doing to my health - for all of the externally visible symptoms, there are twice as many internal symptoms that others aren't privy to. It doesn't dissuade me. Losing weight trumps all else.

I also end up using concerned comments to extrapolate my progress from. I have body dysmorphia, so in my eyes I am disgustingly fat. Yet, if others are concerned for my health, I must be getting thinner. Maybe I'm even ""thin"". I must be somewhat thin, if I look unhealthy enough to elicit their concern.  It fuels me to restrict harder. 

Sorry my response isn't optimistic. **I'll reiterate once more that this is just MY experience being in your coworker's position.** 

My only advice is to be her friend. Show her you care about her as a person. A lot of the time, EDs are fueled by feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing. If that's the case for her, maybe one day she won't feel the need to restrict calories to feel ""worthy of love and respect"".

If she *doesn't* have a disorder this can be extremely awkward. The first step is being absolutely positive there's a problem. 

You said she gets disgusted at the idea of unhealthy food, maybe ask her where to go for a healthy lunch. You could tell her you're looking at changing your diet and know she's a health food fan so you're interested in her input. Make plans with her to hang out outside of work ahead of time, this way when she recommends a place you can suggest going there when you get together. If she suddenly bails you can safely assume there's a problem. If you want to be doubly sure you can make plans to hang out again and then when you get together suggest going to said place for lunch and see what happens.

When you do bring it up,I would preface it with something along the lines of ""I'd like to talk to you/ask you about something personal but don't know if it would be crossing a line, is that ok?"" if she says yes you can explain you're just worried because you never see her eat. You're just concerned about her well-being and want to make sure she's ok and if she isn't you want to make sure she knows you're there to listen or help or support her if she ever needs that otherwise you just want to express your concern as a friend and let her know you see her.

Now don’t take that as you should ignore it, but possibly go about it differently. Being a good friend and continuing to invite her places or talk with her really is the best thing to do. As I’m sure we all know,
It’s not about the food

You don't have to talk to me, but I just want you to know, if you ever need to talk, or just want to go out and do something fun, I'm here for you"" IF you feel that that's something that you can take on. You, of course, have to put yourself first and wouldn't want to take on too much, however, if you think that you can handle being a friend to her, should she want it, I would go that way. You want to stay away from any language relating to her eating habits, how she's looking, weight loss, etc., and also stay away from giving advice without being asked.

Some of us have characteristic neurophysiology that gives us psychological rewards when we restrict calories. This makes us vulnerable to restrictive eating disorders. [Decoding Anorexia: How Breakthroughs in Science Offer Hope for Eating Disorders by Carrie Arnold](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17054418-decoding-anorexia) is an excellent overview. There are similar characteristics in people who are vulnerable to opioid addictions. Most people will do fine with a perscription for percocet after surgery, but it can destroy other people's lives. Those who've recovered from addiction can never again take a single dose except under careful medical supervision.

Yes, there have been some studies showing benefits of intermittent fasting. Many have been done on animal subjects, but some on humans. As with any study, the benefits are only applicable to people who are in the representative population, and the benefits are overblown in articles for lay people. The primary purpose of such articles is to get as many people to read as possible. 

If you've had a restrictive eating disorder you are *not* in the representative population. You are instead like the person who has been clean for a long time and who can't safely accept that prescription for Percocet. Do not risk falling back into your disorder. Do something else that has been shown to improve your health. Meditate, exercise (if you're cleared to do so), get more sleep. Just don't take the risk of restricting.

I have depression, anxiety, am dealing with childhood trauma, and have ADHD. I'm able to deal with all the other shit pretty """"""easily"""" now but the anorexia is the one that takes the most fucking work. I can deal with the other stuff because this is not literally in my face and also necessary for my survival. 

I think I've just passed 12 years with my eating disorder and the only thing I can tell you is that if you keep trying to choose recovery it will get better, and it will get easier. 

Now I think that sometimes, maybe, ""choosing recovery"" is not the most helpful way to frame it all the time. For me, personally, I struggle/d with perfectionism. With the benefit of hindsight, I can see that because ""recovery"" is ambiguous, but also quite loaded, my ED had corrupted the idea of ""choosing recovery"", making it rigid, presenting me with a false dichotomy, and therefore making it something I could easily fail at which fueled the freaking ED. What helped me was thinking about it as having the option to choose ""not the eating disorder"". Maybe this is the same thing as choosing recovery, but this reframing helped me immeasurably because ""choosing recovery"" felt like a standard I had to meet, and sometimes I just couldn't do it. Otoh choosing ""not the eating disorder"" meant that whatever I was capable of doing to genuinely help myself was a win, even if it wasn't ""perfect"""", and I just really needed that sometimes. This way of thinking about the choices you have is absolutely not immune to ED Corruption either, unfortunately, and it was hard as fuck but it felt more manageable. A lot of the time I didn't really know how to choose recovery, but with my psychologist helping me with self reflection I was able to identify things the ED would choose for me and I could (try to) choose not that. If you have someone to talk to, a friend, a relative, if you're at school there could be a counselling service, or somewhere online/over the phone, even just writing things down in a journal, I would strongly recommend you find a way to verbalise/externalise ED thought patterns so you can develop a framework of things you want to say ""no"" to. All those seemingly small (but also hard af) ""not the ED"" choices will add up. 

Even now, I have my ups and downs, but I've been doing pretty great at managing my ED and have been for a while, but I'm like... ""Am I recovered? What even is that? Am I choosing it right now?!"". Idk. I don't think I'll ever know for sure but I have come to terms with that, and whenever the ED turns up the volume in my life I know that even though I don't have a framework of ""normal"" I can rely on, I can and will always try to choose not the eating disorder and that feels very empowering for me. 

___ 

When I first started treatment, honestly my ED got way worse. They way I like to think about it is that there was this battle going on in my brain. Before I started treatment my ED was just cruising along controlling the fuck out of my life I honestly had NO idea I was sick. Like, I basically have total memory loss from the time between getting sick and starting treatment. Treatment was the first point I actually recognised my ED, and even though I didn't initially recognise it as bad cos I was balls deep in it, it was still a point where a challenge was made to the total control it had over my life, and it made the ED ramp up. 

The next few years were a torturous rollercoaster. Idk why but the idea of ""turning up/down the volume"" is smth I groove on. Initially, there was one soundtrack to my life and it was the ED ""casually"" drowning out anything else. Then treatment flipped a switch and in my brain it was this chaotic flipping between the ED going full ball, and actual me being like ""yo this song sucks"", then the ED fighting back like ""no it doesn't reeee"". I know it's fucked, but I remember thinking it was easier to just have the old ED song playing drowning out my life but, again, with hindsight I can see that this chaotic flipping was so fucking important in terms of recovering because it meant I was resisting even though it honestly didn't feel like it at the time. It just felt shit tbh, but I can see that it was important. It was exhausting, and it went on for a few years, but over that time the ED song maybe wasn't as loud, or maybe it didn't come on for so long, and then I found I had more and more agency over what tunes I was jamming to. The ED song is still on my playlist, I think it always will be but it's at 0 most of the time. If it comes on I can turn it back down.

Uh I've kinda rambled on and on, sorry. I hope any of this is remotely helpful to you. You got this, you can choose not the ED, this is corny as fuck lol but I hope you find your jams. I really, really mean it when I say you can pm me if you want to rant or need someone to talk to.

First, I'm not a professional, but I study nutrition and have a history of battling eating disorders. It seems that his eating and exercising habits, once disordered, have entered into a full-blown eating disorder, that can seriously put him at several health risks. Fasting is starvation. There is nothing that is detoxing about starvation. Our bodies are equipped with organs and systems that efficiently ""detox"" the body. The liver, pancreas, intestines, and kidneys are very good at performing this job. ""Bad foods"" or ""poisonous foods"" are made up of the same nutrients as ""healthy foods"": carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals. ""Bad foods"" may have more fat or sugars in them, but they break down the same way as an apple or milk would. There is room for ""bad foods"" in our diet, in accompaniment with ""healthy foods"". It's just about creating a balance and variety in the diet. It sounds like your boyfriend heavily buys into food quackery and his body is a victim of the false claims that he reads about. I'm curious what are the contents of the hunger suppression supplements he takes?

All this being said (sorry for the long-windedness), as his partner, it is your job to voice your worries and confront this problem honestly and candidly. The fact that it is infiltrating your relationship and the way YOU eat is not okay and needs to be addressed before you fall victim of an eating disorder. I would do some research. Read scholarly articles that address the problems with fasting, and the issues with diet culture. I suggest listening to Christy Harrison's podcast ""Food Psych"" as a way to gain some insight. Good luck.",number1wifey,1545938162.0,2018-12-27 13:16:02,"Fasting is a great way to lose weight and there are a lot of emerging studies on its benefits. HOWEVER, where your bfs habits start to be concerning is the idea of food as “poison”, and the purging after holiday meals is extremely disordered. Some people can fast and approach dieting without problems, just like some people can drink daily and not develop alcoholism, and some people are prone to developing disordered eating. It sounds like your boyfriend is the latter. At this point he is focused on the results he’s seeing in the mirror and probably doesn’t want to hear your opinion, but you can let him know you are worried and that you think he should do more research on the long term damage to his health he could be doing. The number one thing you should focus on here is yourself.  If he is lecturing you on “eating poison”, let him know “I see food as nutrition, there’s no good or bad food, there’s only food. And this is what I choose, I’m healthy, and I think it’s a slippery slope to start thinking that way”. And then enjoy your food!

I know people are big into Intermittent Fasting, which let’s face it is just a way to reduce calorific intake per week, and therefore losing weight. This does not sound like IF though, it does sound like starvation and overexercise.

Its hard to get someone to realise that though, because he is so sure that what he is doing is right... What I would say is that if he tries to police the way *you* eat, you should stand your ground and push back. If you can point out to him that what he is saying makes no sense, maybe he will understand that he has to eat normally. You could try to explain to him how dangerous crash dieting is, there’s all kinds of problems that can happen if the body sustains that stress for too long. I think the key lies in trying to find out *why* he has begun to do this, and if you can broach the subject, mention to him the things you mention here, how he has changed and not acting the same as before.

- asking your doctor for a blood test to see if there’s a hormonal problem or a deficiency, like anemia
- if you’re in a state with medical marijuana, asking about that as a way to boost your appetite

You're eating according to your hunger cues, and that's a really good thing. Though I'm curious why you say you're against gaining weight.

Like other people have said, though, you might want to make sure that there isn't anything making your appetite artificially low. Maybe you're stressed or your hormone levels are off.

I've mostly recovered from my ED, but now I have a similar issue to you, where I just don't feel like eating sometimes because I'm focused on other stuff or not that hungry.

That being said, part of recovery means striving to be normal as an eater. It's okay that you are doing this now, because you must eat and do whatever is necessary to put that as your TOP priority; but, in the long term, it's potentially damaging to isolate yourself, and as someone who has been to professional treatment, we are taught to keep our eyes on our own plates (i.e. not worry about what others do/don't eat) and to redirect and reframe our own thoughts when there are comments or discussions that are not healthful for us to internalize. You cannot possibly eliminate ALL the diet talk, the food obsession, the constant triggers of the world - you have to adjust your own thinking, and also learn to cope with the distress. 

One of the best methods to do this is to practice dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). I learned a lot about it at my treatment, and it has changed my life and is so practical. It's a combo of CBT and mindfulness inspired by eastern philosophies. One of the focuses is ""distress tolerance"". Please check that out (Google) or read any of Marsha Linehan's books/materials.

But also more importantly do therapy, if you can. Thoughts of ED are the most difficult part, gaining weight, is easier than the emotional gains. Maybe keep a journal where you can write down those bad and good feelings and later on just look at them in the paper and try to manage them (I say try because it can be a loong journey).

 Don't mind what people are saiyng just listen to yourself and find a good therapist, you shouldn't go through this alone. If you ever want to talk do not hesitate to write to me :) ",rachihc,1546601491.0,2019-01-04 05:31:31,"Hi. This is why I am angry at society fatphobia, people will ignore ED and mental health, to praise weight loss.  
But I am glad you want to do something about this.   
I would also encourage you to go to a professional, ASAP. Both a therapist and a nutritionist, I hope you can cover the costs. Recovering physical health is not very difficult, but for most of us the mental part is the real struggle, so a therapist is important.  
Meanwhile, to eat more, carry with you always some food, peanuts, seeds, cheese, cookies, anything small but really high in calories and that you enjoy. Give them a bite every hour or so, try small meals through the day and increase portion size slowly. Maybe avoid spicy food, that is something I still need to avoid. And try to always stick to high calorie foods until you are able to adjust the volume, as much as you are comfortable of course.   
I would also suggest to get a MultiVitamin/mineral, calories are not the only problem, but lack of micronutrients can have a big impact in your overall health and feeling, this comes at no weight cost, so feel safe.   
",thrownaway9905,1546785434.0,2019-01-06 08:37:14,"My advice involves a few things, none of which are easy to hold yourself to. But I promise it is worth it. 

1. Find a therapist, preferably one who specializes in EDs.
2. Find a psychiatrist, preferably one who specializes in EDs. Ideally you want your therapist and psychiatrist to become your treatment team-- please sign the release form which will allow them to communicate about you. 
3. Fuck BMI. Any good ED specialist, any good physical trainer, and IMHO any doctor who uses BMI as a valid measure of health is not worth your time. It is an outdated model that doesnt factor in muscle mass, bone density, individual frame size, or any number of factors. 
4. Throw away the scale, or at least the batteries. If you cant because other people in your house use it, insist it be stored under the sink or in a closet when not in use. 

It's cliche, but weight is just a number. People often think ""oh, if only I weighed just XYZ pounds, I would be happy."" Except the number never makes you genuinely happy, especially for those living with an ED. 

You need to learn to focus on how you feel, and what helps you feel happier. This is where the Psychologist/Psychiatrist team can most help. They'll help you learn about yourself and why you *really* engage in ED behaviors, and help you learn *healthy* methods to manage those struggles.

I THINK it could be anxiety, because while I have plenty of money, I HATE spending it. Even on necessary stuff like food.

The number one important thing is to make sure you’re eating enough to feel energized and healthy, even if that amount is less than most people. Just be sure to be honest with yourself.

You're her new SO, not her therapist, however, there are ways to support her. 

One of the best things you can do is to go to the NEDA website and read about ways you can both support her and feel supported in how you choose to help her. It's really important that you don't get lost in her illness. 

You're on the right track with trying to get to the root issues. She might not be ready to face her past in its entirety, but it's a start to recognize that her disordered behaviors are a coping strategy, one that's ultimately very harmful and potentially deadly. It would help if she could work with a professional to find new, healthier ways to cope with stress and help heal her past trauma. 

I hope both of you can find a way to get her some support. If her mom won't acknowledge the severity of her illness, she might have to try to find resources through the NEDA website, blogs and books (Tabitha Farrar, Rachael Steil, &amp; me-Lize Brittin) Carmen Cool's website, the HAES website, and/or youtube videos.

Last year my boyfriend and his mom decided to completely give up carbs (and not even in a keto way lol), which had them reading labels of everything and getting on each other every time they ate a carb. I couldn’t even be around them because it triggered me so much. I would consider myself to be in recovery for about 3 years now, but I still have mini relapses and days where my patterns return. Watching them obsess over carbs (while still eating them which was very reminiscent of my binging), was just too much to handle because they had no idea what it was like to have such a severe problem when it came to obsessive control over food. To them it was almost a joke. To me it was not. 

I think it’s just something about watching so many people come together at the beginning of the year and obsess over things that we struggle with every day. It almost makes a mockery of these real problems. Everyone’s obsessed over their holiday weight but in a few weeks it won’t be a thought. I’m still obsessing over my holiday weight from 5 years ago lmao (not really but you get my point).  

My advice to you would be to just stay focused on your own goals and recovery. I know it’s much easier said than done, but all the hoopla will be over soon. People temporarily obsessing over their bodies and health and fitness doesn’t in any way diminish the hard work you have put in. And you can sit comfortably knowing that you have truly put in the work to be healthy again. Let people obsess over their calories and work out every single day. It won’t last long and they will never know the struggle of having to force yourself to *not* count calories, and just eat a regular meal. You’re strong OP!!

I was teaching/counseling a group of high schoolers one summer for a theater arts camp, and they were getting ready to put on a set of one-act plays. While getting costumed, one young girl burst into tears because a dress the costumer pulled for her (where she guessed on the size) was too small. The young lady never shared with us, but she had just gotten out of an inpatient program for an ED a month prior. Having gone through it myself, I spoke to her to let her know she wasn’t alone and got her approval to speak to the costumer about her so we could work to find another costume. When I let the costumer know about the situation, she immediately recoiled in horror and said “oh, i never knew, I was just guessing what would fit her! If I had known that I would have only pulled XL dresses and bigger sizes!”

In the costumer’s brain, it’d be less triggering for the young lady to be dressed in roomy or oversized clothes than to be given something that may fit or possibly be too tight. When you received the xl clothes, this may have been what was going on in your moms head. It’s not the size she sees you as, it may be her way to try and minimize potential body shame/bad feelings. 


Unfortunately, that’s not always how these actions get read, and while there may have been good intentions, they’ll never know that without you speaking up. Yes, it’s awkward and painful and uncomfortable, but have you tried to share your perspective over this? Our family can’t read minds, and aren’t as observant as we want them to be, especially when we’re struggling. Our ED brains put up an extra wall, an extra code for our family to decipher. If we want to progress positively, we need to do some of the legwork for them.

We all break down emotionally from time to time (I actually had a pretty bad emotional breakdown yesterday). What matters is how we handle those emotions. 

As far as food goes.  I am not happy with how modern English speaking culture views food and diet. Distributors focus purely on palatability (how a food tastes), making these foods that you can eat a lot of.  Which is fine, food should be delicious! But when you forego satiation, whats when insanity (eating disorders) sets in. Health is a feeling, a hormonal state in your endocrine system as a way for your body to communicate to your brain.   It's up to the individual to learn about everything they are putting in their body in detail.  Paper value nutrients are not necessarily bio available to the body.

I have clothes ranging from XS to XL myself, even though I've been the same height/weight for my entire adult life.

Or, if she's unaware, you could discreetly ask if she has a receipt, as the item you received was the wrong size. At least in my family, all receipts are kept with the expectation that at least some clothes will be a bit off in size. On the other hand, if you dont think she'd respond well to either, toss it in the donation bin. That might feel rude or dishonest, but your.mental health is a top priority- if even looking at it is detrimental to your recovery, it's not worth keeping. 

Try not to view it as a sign of how people view you. It takes some active positive thinking, but unless your MIL is typically passive aggressive or otherwise rude, then accept that it was likely unintended and not representative of how people see you. I don't know how far you've come in your recovery but the fact that you've acknowledged your problem and are able to talk or vent about these kinds of things (even if anonymously) is a step in the right direction. I'm no good at offering advice, but I do believe in you OP, and I hope you have a wonderful remaining holiday season. ",xorobinhood,1546111755.0,2018-12-29 13:29:15,"I experienced an emotional setback this Christmas. My dad and brother have always poked fun at me and usually it is completely innocuous. But the tides changed when they started poking fun at the triggers I have with food and my rituals around it. I confronted them last night and they literally laughed in my face. I texted my mom who usually is a good sounding board and mediator.  But when I turned to her for support she said ""You can't even act like an adult and just take things in-stride."" I thought I was being an adult by confronting them directly and then asking for support when they treated me poorly. I now just feel like this stuff is too big for them. My dad and brother are who they are and my mom is at her max with dealing with me. She has tried to coach my dad and brother on how to handle my triggers but they just wont listen. 

Now I'm left with an overload of anxiety and feeling like I've been abandoned again. I'm just going to have to lie to them and say things are ok even when they're not. I wanted them to be partners in my recovery but they appear unable. At least I live 5 hours away and only see them every few months.

For a little backstory: I am 31 and have been dealing with EDs since I was 12.  I “came out” with it at 17 to my family to my doctor &amp; to my friends.  When I was 22, my mother bought me all of these clothes from old navy for Christmas.  They were maternity clothes (I was not pregnant).  I was devastated.  My mother, unaware and insensitive to how this could impact me just said “oh I just liked the clothes and they made me think of you”.  Meanwhile I’m thinking “so you think I’m so fat, I can’t even wear regular clothes”. My whole recovery has been spattered with people who just do not understand that these things are extremely powerful for those that think like we do.  It isn’t even about “how they see us” because they don’t even think of it.  With your MIL it could be as simple as XL is a blanket size that could fit most people so she wouldn’t have to worry it “wouldn’t fit you”.  It could also be something stupid like “oversized is trendy so that’s cute”.  You’re not alone and it’s hard.  Keep going, keep reaching out.  You’ll be ok.

328,aeu6vc,freshcutbasil,1547209370.0,2019-01-11 06:22:50,"I can totally relate to this. You are absolutely not dumb. Binging and purging is a terrible cycle we can get caught up in. It wastes so much food and it makes us feel like shit and yet we continue to do it. It’s also hard to not be taken seriously when you do have disordered eating and yet are a healthier weight. I am also considered a somewhat healthy weight, if not borderline overweight (I workout daily and have muscle) and I am also struggling with binging and purging but I’ve never been formally diagnosed.

For me, cereal foods and ice cream were some of my big triggers and I would just eat copious amounts and purge. Once I was on my own I knew I had to not allow myself to buy those foods. I also did not eat them when they were available other places. This helped me a lot. Just remove the temptation. I also am trying so hard everyday to eat intuitively and eat for performance. This has been by far the hardest for me but has been so rewarding the days I can do it. I really lack self control and trying to consistently track my calories has personally helped me. There would be days I would be eating 3000 calories. It made me realize how out of control it was. Now I personally shoot for 2100 with a certain macro breakdown. There are still some 3000+ calorie days but progress isn’t streamline and I try again the next day. I know some people can get obsessive with tracking calories so it’s not for everyone. Also I calculated this calorie goal according to my energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate and it makes sense for me. I’m telling you because it’s a realistic number for me and please don’t compare it to what number may be healthy for you. Eating my calorie goal and certain macro breakdown has definitely helped me so much in lifting heavier in the gym and being able to go on longer runs. It’s helped my recovery time and how my muscles feel overall. I haven’t weighed myself since I started eating more intuitively but I can see positive results in the way my clothes fit me. I feel more confident and feel like my mood has generally improved.

Im not qualified really to tell you what to do but this is my story and what’s helped me. However, if you want my advice, it’s to tell you to please listen to what your body needs and don’t let yourself go on autopilot and binge. Binging will always lead to you wanting to then purge. It’s so incredibly hard but if you eat good food and listen to your body, then when you go on your next run, maybe it won’t suck as much because you’ll be energized to do a good run. Maybe check out Natacha Oceane on YouTube? She’s also struggled with eating and while shes more restrictive and a cleaner eater than I’ll ever be, I think her recovery story is relatable and she has good advice. Good luck on your journey! ",555Milan,1547219662.0,2019-01-11 09:14:22,"Thank you so much for replying to my post. I'm glad you have tips and advice that are helpful for you and they might be helpful for me too. I hope you won't mind if I ask you a few questions about your recovery. 

Would you mind it if you didn't go to the gym for a week or more? Or just skip a workout day? It's important to know what your motives are for exercise. That's what I learned during therapy: question your actions that might involve a disordered relationship with food and your body-image. What is 'eating clean' according to you? Why are cereal foods and ice cream triggers for you to binge-eat? You can't avoid and fear those foods forever, because the cycle of purging and binging will continue. Instead of eating huge amounts of ice-cream and cereal in one go, try to eat a normal-sized bowl of cereal (for example).

I avoid checking out 'fitness inspirations' even though they *claim* they have recovered from an eating disorder, because I know it is one of my biggest triggers. 

One of the most important lessons I have learned about eating disorders: 

**You cannot recover from an eating disorder without anyone's help.** 

I experienced this myself and, believe me, you will try to sugarcoat and believe all the BS of an eating disorder you think is good for you. I hope you can reach out to people that will take you seriously and support you, because you cannot recover from this alone. I wish you good luck with your recovery. ",lemon_vampire,1547220499.0,2019-01-11 09:28:19,"Hi, I'm a binge eater in a more advanced stage of recovery.  What helps is to stop holding back as much.  If you are constantly trying to suffer with your diet and exercise and it stops becoming enjoyable, your body and mind will rebel.    

I don't know how you feel about food and cooking, but I strongly suggest beginning to educate yourself on cooking, food quality (beyond ""healthy"" and ""unhealthy""!), satiety vs palatability and how to make satiating foods palatable.  You love food, we all do deep down.  But we grew up in a society that demonized certain foods. Food isn't good or evil.  It's more important for it to be satisfying or not so satisfying.  It's okay to think about food.  Think about the French, the Italian and the Spanish.  They love food, their entire culture is revolved around it.   

&amp;#x200B;

Think about FAT SOLUBLE nutrients. Sometimes 2 foods that are the same actually have different nutrient values depending on quality (example: commercial eggs vs pasture raised eggs, one is way more nutrient dense)

Don't get me wrong, I can cook and enjoy my favourite meals, regardless how 'healthy', 'unhealthy' or 'clean' it is. I have been taught by a therapist and dietitian what eating normally is, for example the difference between eating candy in moderation and binge-eating. But sweets and treats seem to trigger a 'black-and-white' mindset: ""you *must* eat a lot of chocolate or don't eat it"". I know how to deal with binge-eating, but sometimes I fall off the wagon.",freshcutbasil,1547224561.0,2019-01-11 10:36:01,"I go to the gym to feel stronger and to get more toned. It’s a destressor to go to the gym. It helps me unwind from work and give me some me time. If I skip a day or a week, I could do it and enjoy some other activities I like but going to the gym honestly helps keep me from wanting to stay in bed all day. I’m active because I need those feel good endorphins. I can feel myself being less happy and more negative when I don’t exercise. On the flip side though, if I’ve gone only 2 days in a row and am feeling a rest day when I wake up, I take it. Even if my friends invite me to go with. It may be helpful to know I’ve never had a unhealthy relationship with the gym. I’ve never felt like I was good at lifting weights or had good form and this makes me want to avoid it but I go anyway because I enjoy it. I’ll look in the mirror and think negatively about myself but then I focus on contracting my muscles fully every set and making my numbers go up on the weights and those things makes me feel proud. But honestly I can hardly stand those “fitspo” Instagram accounts. It makes me so annoyed to see them pop up and most are trying to sell cleanses and detoxes which are all garbage. I go for the workout videos and how to improve my form and then I click away. 

As for clean eating, Natacha eats these amazing meals which are balanced between protein, carbs, and fats, normal portions, but especially high in fresh fruits and vegetables and lean meats, especially high in fish. I love my chocolate too much to eat like her! But I guess I could say it’s great she eats that “clean” it’s just not realistic for me. If something is too restrictive I’ll derail from my progress. I feel like trying a normal sized bowl of ice cream seems just...impossible. I totally go into overdrive and keep coming back to the tub or I’ll just sit with the tub and eat it all in one sitting. It’s just such a compulsion. Maybe I’ll try going to Culver’s and order a one scoop bowl. I’ll try it out and see because you’re right it’s not something I should avoid for forever. 

I think you’re right. Nobody should do it alone. I don’t know why I’m trying to. I guess I tried to study to become a dietitian to sort of teach myself what’s healthy but that doesn’t really replace an actual therapist. Thank you for your thoughtful response. I have a lot to think about!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would be inappropriate to humiliate and insult her back, however- though I would discourage it in general. You're correct in that it's not healthy. If she was an older student (at an age that should absolutely know better), you could maybe have a mature conversation with her, or simply avoid her to the best of your ability. Perhaps another teacher or administrator could speak to her about her behavior. I imagine if she said it to you, she's said it to other students too- let them catch her in the moment.

As another commenter said, how much it gets to you is up to you. We can't always help how we feel- *initially*. But sometimes we do have to take control of how we process those feelings. You've been sick, and now your better. Remind yourself that health is a process, and it's not determined only by a mirror or a number on the scale. Take a few minutes each day to reflect on how far you've come from your lowest point. One comment or setback shouldn't be enough to undo all of that, so don't let it. You're so much stronger than that. Take things just one day at a time, and focus strongly on your progress- forget your weight, just focus on all of your health- emotional, mental, and physical. Your body is amazing already for overcoming years of disordered eating and a 1.5 month-long illness. Now it's time to recuperate. Her comment doesn't matter because you are still recovering and rebuilding, and with a bit of time and care, you will be okay. You're at day one of it, and you have a little ways to go, but you can get there. 

I want to also add that if you are not in therapy, go see a professional. If you are, tell her about this experience and how you've been feeling. If nothing else, venting to a professional will help you process it more easily. Health is a process, and ED recovery is an even longer one.

It’s easier said than done, no doubt. Sometimes you just have to dig down realllly deep and tell yourself that you will be okay and you will take steps to be better.

Its helpful to see their daily posts of encouragement :)",BooksThings,1546963483.0,2019-01-08 10:04:43,"I struggle with the same problem.  

I’ve had ED’s since high school, and it seems like, at each stage of my life, I experience a different one.  Beginning of high school was anorexia after I struggled with being overweight during my pre-teen years.  Then I went through a weird obsession where I would only eat certain foods and not others.  That lasted for years.  Then I went through a super strict restriction phase, coupled with 1 day a month of binging..that led to where I’m at now.  Now, I go through these cycles where I restrict, then I binge.  Then I restrict, then I binge, again.  I’m, currently, working through this ED that has lasted for about 4 years now.  

But..one thing I’ve learned is how psychological it all is.  (No shit, right? Took me that long to learn that? Lol). I was reading this article a while back that was about this experiment that was done  years ago.  I can’t remember the time frame that it took place.  Anyways, they took some volunteers.  All of these volunteers were at a reasonably healthy weight and didn’t have an unhealthy relationship with food.  And overtime, they slowly started decreasing their calorie intake until they were eating like, maybe, an apple a day.  Then they observed the weight loss and behavior these people exhibited during the calorie restriction.  It lasted for about a few months, if I remember correctly.  Obviously the subjects were struggling and having a hard time.  Then, once they observed enough, they started slowly adding more calories back to their diet and eventually they were eating regular meals again.  When the experiment was over, the subjects were never the same again.  A lot of them became obsessed with food, would over eat, and would even hoard food because they never wanted to experience that feeling of starvation, again.  The conclusion they came to was that when people experience starvation it does something to them psychologically.  They have this irrational fear that they may experience starvation again so they  stock up on food, eat bigger meals, and just  overall develop an unhealthy relationship with food, to kind of prevent themselves from experiencing starvation.  Basically, it causes this imbalance where the brain is sending signals to rest of the body to eat as much  food as possible in order to prevent starvation.  

That’s where dieting comes into play.  Because it, more or less, supports why people fall off of a diet if they restrict too much or why people who don’t eat enough for a long of period then start eating too much.  What happens is you are tricking your body into thinking it’s in starvation mode, so it’s trying to kick start itself into survival mode.  Then the mental illness kicks in because it then becomes this habit you can’t break.  Then it becomes a cycle and so on and so on.  

That is what I think a lot of people are dealing with when they have a binging ED.  ",lemon_vampire,1546963842.0,2019-01-08 10:10:42,"What is your current diet like now?  Like what is an example of a typical day of eating for you?

Let me rephrase that...dieting has a 95% failure rate. This failure plays into the diet industry's pocket because it plays on desperation all masked with claims of scientific evidence. But what happens is that the 95% of the people who fail feel horrible, binge, and then try a new and ""improved"" diet.  It's about retraining your mind and being tuned into your body. Even the suggestion of eating more fruits, veggies, and taking apple cider vinegar puts rules on yourself. The last thing you need is restriction and rules...they all contribute to the binge cycle. Start learning how to honor yourself and not worry about the weight...that will come in time as you heal.

My eating disorder began at 15. It wasn't until 31 years later, $1,000s (possibly  $10,000s) of dollars on binging and weight loss products, a screwed up metabolism, and severe depression was I able to free the chains of ED. If only I would have been able to learn more before middle age I wouldn't have to do so much work.

Severely restrictive diets often lead to a period of reactionary hunger, where your brain/body just doesn't trust that its next meal is coming. It's hoarding to prepare for the next famine, as another user described. I went through something similar, and went from a bmi of 16 to 24 in four months. It was terrifying and uncomfortable, but eventually the need to eat everything in sight started to wane. I've been maintaining for a month, and am considering a *slight* restriction to lose a few pounds very, very slowly. I know it sucks to hear, but you may want to honor your hunger for a period and see if it subsides. Please check out Tabitha Farrar's website, she does a much better job of explaining this process.

2. If you haven't already, seeing a therapist can be really helpful. Just tell your normal doctor that you'd like to see a therapist and they'll provide you with the resources you need to connect with someone. Don't settle for anyone that you don't completely trust.
3. Eating three actual, full meals a day helped me so much to not binge, and to my complete and utter astonishment I didn't gain weight. I always would skip breakfast and go as long as I could without eating, have a tiny lunch around 1:00, and then at night eat an enormous dinner or go on a full binge and my weight was all over the place because of it... ever since I've started having breakfast, lunch and dinner (no intermittent fasting, a little calorie counting but nothing manic) my eating and energy levels are so much more stable. I wasn't able to get to the point until I took the battery out of my scale. This flat doesn't work if I'm weighing myself every day. My husband gives me the battery back every Sunday morning and I check then. 
4. I totally get feeling like you're nothing without your eating disorder, and loving the release of a binge/purge/laxative session (you feel great but also like garbage?). Next time a 50 calorie overage makes you feel like you may as well make it 5000, take a couple deep breaths and wash your dishes or paint your nails or something. If you still want to after that, that's fine &lt;3

I'm a rollercoaster with my eating disorder. One week I'll be so consumed by it, the next I'll be like ""Fuck this. I need to recover. My body needs me."" And I'll start to go through the process of recovering, eating whole meals, and some snacks in between, laying off the exercise. Before I know it, a week has gone by, and I truly start to miss the thrill of the disordered eating. I miss the feeling of an empty stomach, of going to bed hungry, if waking up famished. I miss feeling like there's something wrong with me, that I'm sick, I miss people telling me to eat more. It is so immensely hard not to fall back into disordered eating habits.
And if I'm honest, I'm at a period right now where I have pushed recovery aside--postponed it--for the sake of feeling those highs again.
But I want to end this comment on a positive note, so I'll tell you what things helped me desire recovery during the few times that I did desire it: 
1.) Wanting to have energy and strength more than I wanted those highs. Specifically, I wanted to be able to dance again, go for runs, without feeling dizzy or knee pain. 
2.) Wanting to have a normal relationship with food. Specifically, the thought of having a normal breakfast like everyone else in the world was so exciting to me. I love pancakes. And eggs and waffles. Sometimes food truly appealed to me more than my disorder.
3.) Wanting to experience food WITH people. The idea of going to out to lunch, or brunch with friends, eating a normal amount, and then not feeling guilty about it--THAT was appealing. That was appealing enough to put my disorder on pause. To be able to eat, finish, and not give it anymore thought, just carrying on with the day, is such an enjoyable experience.

There are so many other reasons that push me to recover (and I know WILL eventually cause my complete recovery), but I don't want to keep rambling on. Ask away if you need more encouragement. Much love.

And try not to punish yourself for listening to your body. If you have a binge, leave it in the past. Try to take each day at a time and nourish yourself every day. I know it's easier said than done. It takes all my willpower to still eat enough the day after a binge.

Under-eating can also cause bingeing, so if you aren't eating enough throughout the month that could be causing those episodes, too. Especially since you're working out, you might need to eat more to catch up with your increased metabolism. Could be something to consider. 

I would say definitely bring this up with your doctor, and maybe catch yourself a therapist too. I sense you feel out of control and stressed about this, and a therapist can give you better tools to deal with your cravings than denying yourself of food for days.

",curlyqchicago,1547770682.0,2019-01-17 18:18:02,"It took my awhile to tell my BF. If you want a relationship with him, you needed to tell him. Anything else would be deceit. I think you made the correct decision and step in the right direction. 

At first mind was supportive. Then he tried to therapist me. Then asked me to get help. Then got upset when I refused help. Then he stopped asking. Then he dumped me. 

He was the first person I ever opened up to and it made me insanely uncomfortable. Like squirm in my seat, stuttering, shut my eyes and pinch my skin, uncomfortable. I was in denial. Took me 14 years to tell anyone. 

You need to set boundaries and expectations. Like you said, you cannot treat him like therapist. You cannot rely on him to make you feel better all the time. You cannot tell him youre starving and expect him not to react. He will react and he has every right. 

My boyfriend and I are still together. After he dumped me, it was my wake up call that I handled everything poorly. 

Now, we have rules. I see a therapist. He understands he will only ever be a listening ear for me. He never gets mad but he will get anxious for me. And I have to understand I cannot control how he feels. He will talk me through acute anxiety meltdowns (“i ate too much ice cream and im starting to freak the fuck out”) and tell me it is okay and hug me. But then I need to put on my big girl pants and solve it too (go for a walk, schedule therapy, breathe, take a bath). 

A lot of this wouldnt have been possible without trust. I trust he does not judge me. I trust he means well. I trust he loves me unconditionally. 

When we were in our first 1-2 years together, I didnt trust him. I thought, “If I eat this 3/4 cup of rice in front of him, he will think I am ok or not sick and making it up”. So Id get weird. But it was all in my head. Or Id lie to him because I didnt want to be a burden. But thats your self-loathing talking. Because if it was him, would you think he is a burden? No, because you care about him. 

Telling my BF was hands doen the best decision I have ever made. He has been pivotal in my recovery. But it takes two to tango. 

Good luck, please feel free to PM me. ",Sheepsquatched,1547775334.0,2019-01-17 19:35:34,"Not sure if this will help.

My bf has always had an idea with my issues regarding food. I find that I'm able to eat more when I'm around him. He started reading a lot about ED and ways to help. He's a very positive person in my life and helps build me up which usually calms me negative thoughts and makes me not feel guilty for eating. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's hard especially when you have no control over it but being able to be fed positivity from my bf has really helped me. I also would encourage him to read up more on ED",stopitma,1547776866.0,2019-01-17 20:01:06,"It's good that he is expressing his feelings and trying to be supportive ,but it sounds like he has a lot to learn still. You could ask him to read a bit about eating disorders to try to understand, and so that he can be a source of support during your recovery. Him being angry isn't a good reaction.

I'm a little bit lucky because my current (sort of) partner worked at a center for eating disorders for two years, and he knows not to press issues. He points it out when I'm doing something problematic, and he offers to share food with me but doesn't press it if I say no. He doesn't comment if I change my mind and end up having some anyway. And he's always opening to listening. He also knows that I'm in charge of my own recovery.

I would say, encourage your boyfriend to learn more about eating disorders, and re-iterate that it is not his responsibility to make you better. Maybe compare it to depression and anxiety, since they are more common mental illnesses and he may know more about that. ",ADDDGAF,1548016653.0,2019-01-20 14:37:33,"Interesting read.

&amp;#x200B;

She explained to me when I met her she was having a really hard time with her eating disorder and had gotten into a few car accidents. Now, that I'm coming out of post concussion it seems as though as she has strayed and I'm not sure if she relapsed or what but I want to be there for her and that's how I know I'm crazy about her.

People have said to run from those with EDs but I believe with a lot of love and support it can be healed or is it lifelong?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;",curlyqchicago,1548029925.0,2019-01-20 18:18:45,"&gt; People have said to run from those with EDs but I believe with a lot of love and support it can be healed or is it lifelong? 

I think it is no different than loving an alcoholic, heroin user, or other drug-user. That's a question you'll have to answer for yourself. I also think it depends on whether the person suffering is actively trying to get better or not. I think it depends on how ""bad"" the eating disorder is and continues to be--- is the alcoholic on their 5th DUI, 3rd jail term, and in liver failure? Or is the alcoholic recognizing it is a problem and working on it? If you would put up with the first example, that's your decision but is that any way to live? Again, only you can answer that.

 People tend to romanticize eating disorders; individuals believe they can just convince someone with an eating disorder that they're beautiful and it will all be okay.

The reality is that eating disorders don't care what you think. Eating disorders don't care about your love or support because it isn't about you- it's about what the person suffering believes about themselves. And most eating disorders are lifelong in the way addicts are always addicts. 

How far you will go to support and love someone is your decision. When I was at my worst, I dug food out of garbage cans, threw up in my room and hid it in closets, ran for hours in the middle of the night, stole food, hid food, lied to everyone I knew, acted like a child, had temper-tantrums when I couldn't get my way with food, beat myself up physically with bats, always angry, always mad, always crying, always on edge, had no spine, never stood up for myself..........the list goes on. I was so consumed with self-hatred that I convinced myself that my boyfriend was a loser for liking me. I turned against him because my brain thought, "" I am SO ugly and the fact that he likes me only tells me he is a loser too"". It consumed me. Now that I'm ""better"", I only do five or so of those things from the list. Would you be willing to put up with some of those things?

Also, now that I'm ""better"" than before, I'm completely different that before. My personality, habits, hobbies, thoughts, and opinions are totally different than when I was suffering. You may not like the person after recovery, either. 

How long you can manage to be someone else's caretaker is your business. How much your put up with is your decision. But know you are mostly powerless, nothing you say will make the eating disorder go away, and your opinions may go unheard. 

Good luck.

Same problem though: zero appetite when I’m not high. Absolutely no drive to eat. I’ll go two full days sober without considering a bite of food. It’s destroying my recovery from my ED and it’s making it impossible to cut back on smoking. 

My only solution so far is to drink Ensure Plus shakes and Soylent. NAKED/Bolthouse smoothies are good, too. I’ll do two Ensure (700cals), one Soylent (400cals), chocolate milks (300cals), and a smoothie (200cals) and even if I don’t feel like my recovery is getting better, I won’t lose weight that way. 

After a week or so without smoking, your natural appetite will come back (even if it’s small). When you’re high a lot, you adjust to the crazy munchies and they begin to feel like the norm. Even people without eating disorders struggle with temporary anorexia during tolerance breaks, we just suffer more because we already struggle with the problem.

Try and map out what you used to eat before the event, roughly. Then plan to reach that intake again, little by little, a little more every day. Going from fasting to normal can be challenging and nausea can sometimes be a natural response after fasting, so you can force yourself to eat small amounts at first and let your body re-adjust.  Also, since there is often a mental component, try not to obsess over it, find an activity that you can pair with eating like watching a movie you like or listening to a book, and see if that helps with opening up your stomach when you're not worrying over the meal itself. Finally, if you feel like you have a ""mental block"" and can't force yourself even for small amounts, you definitely need to ask for help with your mental well being. Take care of yourself.

1. As often as possible, I cook my own food. That gives me a sense of control over what I'm putting in my body, which makes it *much* easier to eat.

2. I find other places in my life where I can feel a sense of control. Art, exercise, cleaning my room are all helpful. If your room is already clean, maybe rearrange the furniture?

3. I talk to a therapist about what happened to cause such a severe stress response, and about the response itself. If you're a college student, your school almost certainly has free counseling available.

A plant based diet is not deficient in any nutrients, the only exception of this is B12 but that is a form of bacteria that humans were exposed to in ample amounts when living closer to nature and not in a sterilized environment that we live in today. A lot of foods are fortified with B12 and even animal products are fortified with B12 so as you can see it’s not something that is readily available without supplementation. Although, I would recommend incorporating more fats in your diet especially omega 3s (nuts, seeds, avocado, coconut) because including these in your meals will help you assimilate the fat soluble vitamins in all other vegetables. Not that you don’t assimilate them without but it will be more conducive to the digestion of the majority that you are consuming. 

But the fact that you are binging should be addressed through ample nutrient and caloric intake. Eat until you are full and not restrict through the idea of optimal meal time(late at night or anything like that). Even if you are not consuming animal products that shouldn’t be a problem. I know the depth that I was into veganism, I had no craving for meat or any animal product. My tastebuds had changed to the point that it is repulsive to me to eat meat. But even if you are vegan, you don’t need to have to avoid any plant based foods. If you are hungry, eat, and repeat. You need to allow yourself the permission to follow your hunger and not question it or justify it. If an animal is out in the wild and it comes across food, does it just say it’s going to eat a snack and just consume a little bit and call it good? Or does it eat until it feels like it’s finished eating? Our bodies are smart and have nutrient and caloric sensors that are sending that signal to the brain to let it know that it is full. Some thoughts to keep in mind though are the fact that there are hormones that drive our hunger and satiation, those are ghrelin and leptin. If you aren’t getting adequate sleep then your body is trying to keep up on energy balance so if it’s not getting energy through sleep then it will seek it elsewhere. 

The biggest take away! Follow your intuition, it won’t lead you astray. Hearing that you are vegan sends me the message that you are on a good path. You don’t need to make it a huge deal outside of eating a plant based diet. Eat the rainbow, get your fats, and b12 in. You don’t need to fret about eating a conditioned idea of what’s “appropriate”. Think about what you can learn from an animal in their natural state. Listen to your body and eat!",Rotorr89,1547519423.0,2019-01-14 20:30:23,"I think it really really depends on a lot. Your exercise regime, your goal in working out (weight gain weight loss etc) 

I know for me, when I worked out later in the day close to evening my biggest intake would happen before bed.  If your body needs food always give it. Besides your burning at a higher rate for about an hour after your work out. 

Maybe be conscious of WHAT you’re in taking because eating a lot isn’t necessarily bad but it could be if it’s like sugar, a lot of bread etc. 

If you feel absolutely hungry opt for snacks. 

I follow a fb page called smashly nutrition that’s great and her vids have helped me gauge what a healthy diet even is.  

",lemon_vampire,1547520231.0,2019-01-14 20:43:51,"You forgot about cholesterol.  The thing our brain is made out of.  How do you get that in a plant based diet?  You say proper sleep helps, but our brain is in charge of our sleep cycle. 

Your advice is vague.  ""Eat until you are full"" could mean anything if you have a compulsive binge eating disorder. Binge eating disorders, like anorexia and bulimia, are MENTAL disorders.  

Where do you get brain building material on a vegan diet?  A brain is made of cholesterol. If you have ever seen a real brain in person you would see that it's made of fatty cholesterol.  I used google, I cant find a vegan source of cholesterol.  Those awful unsustainably imported, inflammatory fats you recommend are nothing but triggers for my BED (peanut butter is to me like whiskey is to an alcoholic).

 

Without ethics, veganism has no foundation.  Lets talk about ethics, since the health aspect of veganism is debatable at best.

&amp;#x200B;

More importantly: what makes you think you're really recovered from your eating disorder if you still wont allow yourself to eat an entire kingdom?",malyszkao,1547524804.0,2019-01-14 22:00:04,"If you look into the medical literature you can see how dietary cholesterol is the leading contributing factor to plaque buildup in the capillary arteries which progresses to atherosclerosis, heart attack, and stroke! New studies are even showing that Alzheimer’s is a degeneration of the brain due to plaque from dietary cholesterol clogging the veins in the many regions of the brain. 

If you are recommending consuming the leading cause of many degenerating diseases then you are recommending the path to a slow and unnecessary premature death. I’m sorry I’m not the one making those scientific discoveries, I am only a messenger so please don’t get frustrated with me.

Yes I totally agree with you that it is a mental disorder but the only way to break a obsessive behavior meshed into the subconscious and conscious mind is repetition. Reprogramming the mind through not holding onto certain beliefs that we have adopted is crucial to freedom from the eating disorder. Allowing ourselves to eat what we want, when we want is one of the best actions to take. Mantras and meditation can have a huge roll for rebalancing the subconscious mind. If the person is craving animal products then they have the decision to make it they want to. But if that isn’t the problem then you have to direct the focus to the real problem. 

I would like to offer to you the option of researching into the scope of the intentions and decisions around a vegan diet. It’s a lot to cover but it’s not exclusive to just ethics but also environmental, political, and nutritional. I would recommend the documentaries Cowspiracy, Before the Flood, Forks Over Knifes, and What the Health. Some other awesome resources for unbiased, scientific-based nutritional information is Nutritionfacts.org Hope that helps!

As for the recovery of my eating disorder, I know that I have fully recovered. Recovery is still a long road ahead for everyone that has been plagued by an eating disorder. I have empathy for you and I hope the best in your recovery. But I have emancipated my mind from the slavery I put myself into by restricting calories, eating at fixed times in the day, restricting foods(that I authentically wanted to consume), had a skewed perception of my body image, and an exercise addiction. Today, as I write this, I am free from these obsessive and compulsive behaviors. I fed my body for a period of up to six months thousands of calories a day(probably upwards of 10,000). I started recovery at 135lbs being a 5’10” male and my highest weight in recovery plateaued at 175lbs. I now weigh around 160lbs eating whatever I want and workout the way that I want to which feels more like play than anything. I have built a good amount of muscle and a mind that is ready to help others with eating disorders by giving advice but also just sharing my story. We all have a lot to learn from one another, it’s up to us to choose if we want to take something from it.

I certainly experienced this during my eating disorder(but I labeled it binging and felt ashamed) and it was a mainstay throughout my recovery. It seems like you are binging but you are refeeding your body. From any person that isn’t familiar with extreme hunger it looks and feels like a binge but when you let go of thinking it’s a binge then you can actually move into recovery. Seriously, I would eat so much food and be so physically full but my mind was telling me that I needed more. So what did I do? I fucking ate like there was no tomorrow. I gained a lot of weight fast, 40lbs in under 6 months. But once I had actually started feeding my body all the calories and nutrition it was robbed of, everything balanced out. I now eat what I want without any rules or fear of binging. Hey, sometimes we all overeat at times but not religiously. If you feel like you are out of control then you need to surrender to that and eat because it goes beyond our mental control, our biological “animalistic” nature takes hold and there’s no way of suppressing that but giving in to our true nature. Trust me. 

If you need to talk more, I’m here for you.",strayghi,1547584493.0,2019-01-15 14:34:53,"I'm currently having the same issue. How I try to tackle it :

1) I have an app where I mark when I've eaten a meal. I try to not snack outside that meal time. If you want a treat, it's dessert included in the meal.

2) After the meal I try to go out and do something to get my head out of the food -mode. E.g. a little walk or meeting a friend briefly could work.

If your gas tank light came on while driving down the highway, would you stop and refill it, or would you ask how you can keep a car running without any fuel?  The eating disorder behaviors are the equivalent of getting out and pushing that car to its destination.  You'll get where you wanted to go, but at tremendous cost.  

The subconscious mind usually has a reason when it starts screaming at you.  The fact that this is bubbling up right now is a great indicator that you're on overload.  The excess pressure has to go somewhere, and you have a few options:

1) Reduce the pressure

2) Find a positive outlet

3) Continue using this negative outlet

It is **so** tempting to tell ourselves that we can do it all, because we think we *should* be able to do it all.  But perhaps, at least temporarily, you might want to consider scaling back in some aspect of your life to restore balance.  Of course I don't know your life and circumstances, but an example would be hiring a babysitter or wedding planner to help or taking a half-day off work per week to dedicate to all the tasks you have to complete.  I'm also wondering how much your partner is involved-in or aware of what you're going through.  Simply expressing your struggles to another person can be a form of a positive release (depending on the person, of course).      

Out of all those motivational reasons you listed, I hope your own inner peace and well-being is a factor.  It sounds like you do a lot of giving.  Maybe you need to give a little to yourself right now.  

Hope you find some clarity.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I act on “x” behavior, is it something that causes negative consequences?  

For example, if “x” behavior is continuing to eat after acknowledging you are full and uncomfortable, do you find yourself regularly dealing with consequences as a result?  

Do you regularly experience stomach/digestive problems?  Do you overspend on your food budget in a manner that has you in debt or close to debt?  

Do you decline activities with friends that involve meals because you feel anxious or embarrassed if anyone sees you eat?    And likewise, to you prefer to eat alone/in secret to avoid comments on your choices, ect?  

Do you monitor your own weight in reaction to what you eat?  Do you frequently feel like food is controlling you?  Do frequently find yourself eating as an emotional response?  

(Just a note, I don’t mean for you to answer those questions in a public manner).  

Be honest with yourself.  There are no right or wrong answers...only a personal assessment on how you are feeling and what is going on in your life.

In my own opinion, I feel that by posting here and seeking help, you must already feel that there is something going on that feels wrong.  And that action alone means it is time to reach out to a professional.  

Maybe you haven’t been in any type of treatment before, and feel unsure if your symptoms “are serious enough.”  Or maybe you have been in treatment before, but your symptoms were different.

I just want you to know, you can get treatment at any time.  You don’t have to wait until “X” happens.  If anything is making you feel upset or uncomfortable or out of control, talk to a professional (or several).

",LittleTii,1547340799.0,2019-01-12 18:53:19,"I think that whether or not you officially have an eating disorder, you could benefit physically and emotionally from healing your relationship with food. The fact that you feel shame when eating “unhealthy” foods is a hard thing. There shouldn’t be a moral value placed on food. Unfortunately, as a society it’s the norm. So whether it’s officially an eating disorder or disordered eating, if it is negatively impacting your life, you should reach out for help. Maybe see a counselor or a nutritionist. 

Also one thing I would like to add. The fact that you went on a Keto diet could very well be what has been leading to the binges. I have been battling bulimia for 14 years and I have never restricted or gone on any diets. However the fact that I would purge food (even though I would eat a shit ton before hand), my body thought it was going to be starved. Restrictive eating habits lead to binging. Restricting eating habits can be as extreme as full blown anorexia or something like cutting out carbs. Our bodies don’t know when they are going to eat again so they overcompensate by trying to get all the nutrients in that they can.  Then what tends to happen is that after overcompensating(bingeing), we feel guilty and start the restriction process all over again. Vicious cycle. Anyways, I’m not trying to judge your keto decisions, I am just speaking from experience. 

Bottom line - there would be no harm done in speaking with a therapist. Good luck.

Is there something that happens that causes you to want to binge? When you feel the urge: take account of your day, your situation, your mental state. 

For me personally my eating issues come up surrounding stress. When I’m letting my mind mull over a situation I can’t solve. When I feel overwhelmed or like my situation is bigger than I can handle. My finances are also triggering. I’ve had to really learn how I respond to certain things, the way I view myself, respect myself etc to create new habits. 

I suggest talking with a professional to learn tools or methods you can use.

I absolutely understand the trepidation to take meds as it’s definitely not a decision to be made lightly. That said, I was on it for a year and it really helped me out of a hole. Were there side effects? Yes. Was it worth it for me? Absolutely. 

However, I would say therapy helped me even more than the meds did for my ED and anger issues. The cost can be high, even with insurance, but there are other options like a local university which might offer discounted services. I promise you there are therapists who have experience treating a wide range of issues, not only the ones you described. It might take meeting with more than one until you find one that makes you feel comfortable, but they’re out there. It can be a lifesaver if you’re open to the process.

This is not me being argumentative. Of the options you mentioned are any that are more attractive or attainable at the moment? Maybe first talking to your primary care about the anxiety to see if they have any suggestions?

I adapted a way of politely going through with the conversation, but in my head, I'd have to CONTINUOUSLY remind myself ""that's their body, not mine. My needs are not theirs. Their needs are not mine. Their body does not concern me, or my caloric needs.""

It's really, really key to remember that YOU do not need to diet just because the people around you are dieting. It's OK that you might need to eat more than them or even eat a caloric surplus. It's ok, too, if you need to be resting when they need to be exercising everyday. People around you will talk about diets and fads and exercise trends, it's really inevitable. Just keep reminding yourself that your body is going through something else, and you DO NOT need to diet.

One of them is a young and spry kitty, who needs a lot of the right energy to function well. The other cat is older, more mature, and just as sweet, but her needs are different. Instead of giving her the high energy special cat food, you give her a mature cat food for cats who aren't as active.

If the cats could talk (lol), what if they said ""hey, why don't we both have the same diet?"" - it would be easy to explain. This is how you and your mom are! She is in a different part of her life. Even if she were your same age, her needs are different than yours. Allow her to pursue the health plan that is right for her, and when she talks about it, keep repeating in your mind that she is on her ""diet"" and you are on yours. A diet is exactly the right word for what we eat daily; we are all on a certain diet. Yours just has to be inclusive of more nutrients because you are truly getting over an illness!  Your mom is doing well, and she may be overdoing some things, so she probably is trying to verbalize the knowledge that she needs to make changes.

&amp;#x200B;

For her, it is also very difficult to change.  You're both struggling to do the right things, so when she says ""I need to take just one serving of X because I have to mind my diet"", you can say ""I need more because I have to mind MY diet - which requires more.""....

Maybe it's not the case with you and your mom, but I find that mine often says things that are really hurtful or offensive about me, my child rearing, etc etc-- or simply doesn't acknowledge stuff that is very important to me. I say something to her, she seems to understand, then does it right back again. I have a kid, and I've come to the conclusion this habit of hers is tied to a certain dose of narcissism on her part. Because when you have a kid, stuff becomes not about you in relation to your child. It wouldn't cross my mind to talk shit about my ex to our kid-- doesn't mean he isn't an ass, or that I don't talk this same shit to a trusted friend, etc-- it's just that I'm here to facilitate my kids existence and help her thrive, my kid is not on earth to help me feel good.

What I do with my mom is try to remember she is doing the very best she can, but I do remove myself when she starts inadvertently boycotting me. 

So the lesson here for me is to rely on myself, accept her love in whatever way she can give it, but set some boundaries even if she doesn't understand why. Your top priority should be your recovery, and if she doesn't get why she should be supporting you instead of covertly competing with you, well poor her, you do you.

Depending on how egregious the behavior, I might tell them why first and ask for some space, or sometimes I’ll just quietly distance if I don’t think a chat would be helpful.

In most cases, it results in the person realizing how serious I am about xyz. If it doesn’t, then they weren’t a positive influence and the distance is, in and of itself, helpful for me.

While I’m not fully recovered, and won’t be for years, I at least have the knowledge and tools available to keep me in the right direction. I’m 26 and definitely have had this since I was a child, and know how frustrating having such a limiting diet can be- eating with coworkers, friends, family, or having excuses for why you’re eating a certain food/ or a certain way.

We have to eat as humans and fuel our bodies with the right nutrients, and for someone like myself who has had this my whole life, My only option is to recover and improve my life- though it will take years.

From an extremely young age (around 6) after throwing up after eating a certain canned food, i started to refuse to eat most foods. Every dinner consisted of plain pasta (no sauce or anything at all), garlic bread, or chicken nuggets. I ate plain cereals such as cornflakes and for lunch it was always only bread and butter. This lasted until i was 19-20. Every time i would try anything new i would immediately gag as if i was about to throw up so this restricted me trying anything. I had never had a burger, nandos or any vegetables.

All of my friends just assumed i was extremely fussy and i was always quick to change the subject about food.

I actually went to a guy called David Kilmurry who does hypnotherapy i think it was called. The session was weird he just talked to me while my eyes were shut and had low music in the background. I wasnt sure whether i just fell asleep while he was doing this or if i was in a semi-awake status but it was definitely a weird feeling. Felt like i was there maybe 20 minutes but was actually there (asleep or half awake listening) over an hour. 

Afterwards he left the room with a few little bits of different food for me try if i wanted to. By my surprise i really wanted to force myself to try stuff, everything i tried didnt taste particularly nice but there was no gagging at all.

A year went by after and i hadnt stuck to the plan of trying new foods because i was at university. However now i am home, i can try almost any food i want. My diet isnt amazing, but i can stomach most vegetables, i enjoy a lot of meats such as steak, chicken, lamb chops and pork sausages and meatballs. I now enjoy eggs and bacon also meaning i can finally have an english breakfast. 

I dont know whether it is worth seeing someone like i did, because i dont know if it actually worked if i just convinced myself it worked/had enough of not eating any foods. 

Something thats worked greatly for me is whenever i try something new, dont let anyone be watching you try it and dont concentrate on it. When i first had a burger i was so put off by the look and smell, but then i just said screw it and took a big bite (because i was hungry) and to my surprise i loved the taste!!

Things can get better. I am still underweight and dont eat a wide variety of things on a daily basis but i am slowly improving and losing that initial fear of trying a food has been massive for me. I can now eat out with friends at some places whereas before i would avoid it entirely which got me very depressed.

I swore to myself in the beginning I’d be able to control it and that I wasn’t as bad as others, which only made me worse. The thought of, “I’m not as bad as others,” is so damaging because in a way it kind of encourages you to keep going, or at least it did for me.

Thinking you're 'not sick enough' or 'not skinny enough' to have an ED is a dangerous mindset. It's a common symptom of people with EDs to think that way. This thought process is your mind's way of tricking yourself into continuing these bad habits. That voice in your head (illogical fears, worries, making you do things you normally wouldn't even though you know they're unhealthy) is your worst enemy right now.

While your father has wisdom and experience, he is also biased and dealing with struggles of his own. This is not the best kind of person to ask for advice. Talk to your doctor honestly &amp; openly about all these things...don't downplay anything. I used to 'make an effort' to tell my doctor about my ED, but in reality I was half-assing it and not really telling them the truth. I'd fool myself into thinking I was healthy because my doctors hadn't intervened. But they didn't intervene because I wasn't 100% honest.

There is no single moment when you will know if you have an ED. There is no 'good time' to stop an ED either. But one thing is for certain - every meal is a good opportunity to start the healthy cycle again.

I had a real fear of certain foods, and sometimes I still do. 

I think people who lose weight in a healthy way take it one day at a time and don't judge themselves too harshly for mistakes. They also LISTEN TO THEIR BODIES. If you are punishing yourself today for what you ate yesterday, you are not being healthy. You are also punishing your body for asking you for carbohydrates. Some bodies need more carbs than others.

I recommend non food related dates, coffee can be fine but it really depends on the girl, some are ok with it some it can be a real battle. My husband and I would often go to coffee shops, get some plain coffee or tea, and go walk around downtown in our city. Parks or hikes can be nice, nothing too vigorous since you don’t want it to be all about the exercise. Really just think about keeping the date outside of food, or if you need to go somewhere that does have food because there’s not a lot of options make it clear you just want somewhere to talk and hangout and get to know each other and you can always ask if she has any better ideas. The big thing for me that helped me know my husband was the one is he would never push me to eat! He would encourage it when we were better acquainted and even make me healthy snacks to nibble on our hikes and outings but her never commented or made me feel bad for not eating. The hard thing about first dates are they are really you getting to know each other and most places you sit and talk have some variety of food.

390,akb5kz,ConnectedIsolation,1548589068.0,2019-01-27 05:37:48,"Hi op. Sounds pretty rough but you absolutely did the right thing by not ignoring it. I would say from personal experience the most important thing to keep from slipping back is regular eating. If you struggled when you were a teen then you prolly already know about six points and the four hour rule so I won’t bore you but honestly this helps! Even if you aren’t looking to weigh restore and just maintain, regular eating will help keep your body going.

Secondly, education. I find talk therapy extremely tedious and not very productive however in the last 3 months I haven’t had an option (day treatment, yay!). The group meetings and chair circles make me cringe but the sessions spent figuring out exactly how eating disordered bodies work were very useful. It helped me gain a sense of control that enabled me to make the decision myself. So if you still want to go it alone, buy some books or read up on the topic but be extremely scrupulous as to your information sources. If you find yourself on... unhelpful websites then make sure you stop immediately. Also consider therapy properly. Put aside previous experiences with them and try and be proactive in your sessions. I know it’s difficult to do but I found pretending that my therapist had come to see me was useful in getting the interaction balance right (obviously I would not make a great therapist but you get the idea). Therapy is one of those things that is presented as a service you can have done to you but ultimately it’s the opposite. It’s more like an unpaid occupation which leads me into...

Thirdly. Goals. Make sure you know where you want to be going or want to be doing. Travel? Friends? Promotions? Hobbies? Use all aspects of your life that are negatively affected by Mia to motivate yourself to kick her ass out. This was one I found very tricky as I was struggling with other mental health issues alongside my ed when I first entered treatment 2 years ago. If like me you find projecting forward difficult then I would suggest it’s especially important to talk to someone who knows what you struggle with or open up to a friend or family member that can support you. My family were my motivation for recovery (and still are) and it helps to be accountable to someone for your defeats and your victories. 

Finally the obligatory safety PSA. I’m sure you know how lethal ED’s can be and I cringe typing it but seriously, stay safe. Read up on refeeding if you haven’t already and don’t make any impulsive decisions when it comes to your body. Remember, a living human can turn to a corpse but a corpse can’t turn back (unless you’re an extra in a hit AMC show)

It’s the same here in that there is barely any mention of eds on our curriculum. I think sensitivity training on how not to invalidate and trigger people with eds would be a good start.  Nobody has a clue in that regard and I’ve had plenty of awful experiences with doctors myself where their callousness and insensitivity only made my Ed worse. I also think binge eating disorder needs to be something we cover and learn to recognise in patients. There are so many obesity related illnesses killing people in the western world these days. If doctors could learn to recognise and treat the percentage of that group who have BED/other eating disorders then they could help prevent some of these people dying from the severe consequences of their eating disorder. A final point would be to not automatically assume that weight loss in an overweight person is a good thing. I’ve been praised and told I looked the healthiest I’d ever been by my family doctor in the peak of my bulimia. As I started off obese my rapid 60lb weight loss was not questioned and the sane must happen to a lot of other ed sufferers. I think those things would be a good start at least in getting med students and future doctors to have a better understanding of eds and ability to manage patients with them. ,broketreebranch,1549677410.0,2019-02-08 19:56:50,"Same in nursing school.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a DNP program learning to become a nurse practitioner. Eating disorders haven't even been mentioned in class. Last semester an instructor posted an optional video to watch on EDs that looks like it was made in late 80s/early 90s, this was in a list of some 50+ optional videos so guaranteed nobody watched it (not that they would have found it useful). Basically we're told if you suspect an ED refer them to a psychiatrist.

&amp;#x200B;

Hell, psychiatrists who don't specialize in EDs aren't much help either. When I was inpatient in a general psych unit last November after a suicide attempt I restricted, was already underweight and lost more weight, they didn't notice or care when I told them about the behaviors I was using and the weight loss. The psychiatrist asked me why my regular psychiatrist (who specializes in EDs) would prescribe me xx med, because ""I never prescribe those for patients with eating disorders because it causes weight gain"" freaked me the fuck out and I refused to take my meds, which just led to side effects and pushing back my discharge. When I told him how his words affected me he brushed off my concerns, ""Well obviously it doesn't apply to you because you didn't gain weight."" k.

&amp;#x200B;

If a patient comes to you and tells you about their eating disorder, or they may be concerned, or they're using symptoms/behaviors, understand it takes A LOT to admit that. We overcome so much shame and guilt. The instinct is to hide/deny the eating disorder as long as possible. When someone reaches out like that, it is a VERY delicate, precious moment that can make or break their attitude and willingness to recover. By the time I reached out and admitted my relapse, I was so far gone, my grades were suffering, I was withdrawing, I was suicidal. The waiting list for ED treatment is soooo long, residential or outpatient. If someone is waiting on getting into treatment, check on them frequently. Weekly isn't too often when their symptom use is high, is affecting their life, and their health. Most people with EDs are ambivalent about recovery. Having to fight insurance and jump through so many hoops to get help when you're already malnourished, depressed, and stuck in the cycle can kill that motivation to recover.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of health, an ED destroys your life in so many ways that can't be measured by vital signs, weight, and lab values. It destroys relationships, careers, and your will to live.  


After I called the treatment center it was a week for my intake. After my intake with an MD it was another 5 days for me to see a therapist, the next available psychiatrist was 4 weeks out, the next RD available was 6 weeks.

A week after my intake assessment I attempted suicide.

Talking about diets to anyone is usually not the best idea, but especially not to someone who has a history of an eating disorder. They need to remove themselves from diet culture in every way that they can. Talking about fasting will normalize the idea that going hours/days with food is a normal, non disordered behavior and her ED might take advantage of that thought.  


If you would like to be a supportive daughter, you should not mention anything about your own dieting and if it comes up, don't talk extensively in detail about it. You could also help her by not labeling foods as unhealthy/healthy good/bad since once a person with an ED hears a food is unhealthy they will avoid it and that is very damaging.

That's a really big step. Know that sometimes relapses/setbacks are common. Does your therapist know about your relapse? Is there anyone that you feel comfortable (friends, family) talking to about it? For me, it really helped during the intial stage to talk to someone about my relapse (they would encourage me and hold me accountable when I couldn't muster the energy to do so myself). When I didn't have anyone to talk to, I turned to hobbies to help keep my mind off of food/my ED/my ED thoughts/etc. I took up painting!

In terms of making a decision, I'd recommend writing a list of pros and cons in regards to keeping this person in your life. You've sort of done it already, but perhaps having it physically listed will add clarity, especially when you consider that frankly, you *have* to prioritize yourself in recovery. This disorder is potentially life threatening, and I imagine you want to give yourself the best possible chance of escaping this void. I'd find those comments incredibly triggering, too.

i've since found that this is more common than you would think, and can be a response to any number of things, like past trauma or social anxiety or as a way of coping with/rejecting negative (sometimes dangerous) forms of attention that often come with being read as female. it's rough out there! sadly being more aware of all this did not cure my eating disorder but i think there is always power/hope in trying to find the underlying causes of our behaviours. good luck and solidarity to you!",innocentcinnamonroll,1549466235.0,2019-02-06 09:17:15,"I currently bind but since I have a bigger chest, it doesn't help all the time.

I get exactly where you’re coming from in thinking that it’s not a valid eating disorder because you’re not starving yourself etc. But it is valid and you don’t deserve to be suffering. Look into eating disorder programs in your area and try to see a psychiatrist/psychologist/nutritionist and get the professional support you need.,_Pulltab_,1549360441.0,2019-02-05 03:54:01,I know you have had vitamin levels checked but have you had magnesium checked?

Now that I’m finally starting to eat a more balanced diet, instead of pretty much just cereal, I don’t find myself struggling with it at all anymore.

You can definitely incorporate ALL foods - choc. included - into your recovery. And yes, you need to embrace the fact that you are worthy of recovery. There is nothing ""less than"" With your situation, than with someone else who has ""classic"" ED symptoms. Some people are in a more deadly health state, but that is nothing to desire, and you definitely have the right to feel frustrated.  

The thing you have to try and do is look first for resources - are there any professionals that you can seek out to try and discuss your feelings about this? They could definitely shed light on the matter, and if anything, you may realize there is something for which you hunger, but nothing foodwise can satisfy it. Chocolate is your medicine, but it's not doing an effective job, because you are realizing that it doesn't make you happy or allay your worries.

ALL foods - even the ones we label as ""junk"" are worthy of being eaten in moderation. There are no good or bad ones. Chocolate can be a part of your life, but you have to still eat a variety of foods in order to be strong and healthful.  

Therefore, what about seeing a registered dietitian? There would be so many benefits, and she could challenge you to try and start eating more balanced meals.  

If anyone tells you that you are not able to fix this, or that you have to start depriving yourself, they are not a true ED professional, and you should avoid them. Seek people who are able to help you get to the bottom of the reason that chocolate is your go-to; there is something that you need -- starting with more food -- that has to be addressed.

I keep some in my house and it doesnt trigger me to binge like a bar of chocolate or chocolate syrup cause it is less sugar. If your trying to avoid binging you can just eat a straight tablespoon its only 10 calories and VERY chocolatey (maybe too much) but it may satisfy your craving mentally so you can move on and not focus on needing chocolate. You can also add cocoa powder to hot water to make a comforting beverag or you can add cocoa to oatmeal. There is lots of ways to enjoy chocolate in a healthy way. If you have a hard time with a certain food best to not keep it in the house and if you want it only buy a single serving to enjoy in that  moment.

As you know, body dysmorphia doesn’t always translate to others. She may feel one way about herself and completely differently about you regardless of the objective dimensions. Not that that matters, what matters is how YOU feel about you, but just wanted to throw that out there.

If the baby is on the chart, so to speak, and within the range of what could reasonably be expected for their current age compared to their birth stats (which is why the 1 percentile exists), then its possible the baby is safe.

That said, I’d be concerned about the mom not meeting her own nutritional needs as the body might be prioritizing the milk. 

The color of the milk, the composition at face value, doesn’t necessarily mean anything. Everyone’s milk is different. Mine didn’t look particularly fatty and my kids were happy little chubs. 

Personally, I’d talk to her about being up front with her doc about her history of anorexia so they can be extra diligent about monitoring BOTH Mom and baby’s progress.

433,atg9fz,IronLok,1550844225.0,2019-02-22 08:03:45,"Honestly no matter what anyone can benefit seeing a therapist.
Considering you’re going through changes such as having an office job and gaining weight, which has affected your view of yourself, you could definitely get some help working on your self-esteem.
As for your eating pattern, you’re entering a dangerous playing field. It’s best to consult and catch the behaviour early before it truly becomes a full blown eating disorder.
I understand that gaining weight can be scary, in high school I freaked out and ended up engaging in the behaviour you’re describing. Cue a 5 year battle.
It’s admirable that you’re looking for help and I truly encourage you to pursue it because you don’t want this in your life. You’ve worked hard to get this job and an eating disorder can truly change you. Don’t let it destroy what you’ve worked so hard for.
As for weight loss, if you really are concerned about your weight it is much healthier to just make sure you’re eating healthy quantities. You might be eating next to nothing but because of it when you do start eating again you will quickly gain the weight back.
Eating smaller but healthier portions and doing as little as taking a walk during your breaks can help you feel better mentally (who are you kidding? Not eating sucks!) but it will encourage you eventually to be more active.
For the feelings of disgust it’s common to feel that way if you haven’t eaten for a while. My advice is to eat anyways, eventually you’ll start craving certain foods and it will make it easier to eat.
If you end up binging it’s also normal because you have starved your body. Don’t engage in binge/restrict cycles. If you binge that’s okay, acknowledge it and continue eating anyways.
Best of luck to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ED diagnoses are honestly so unclear, it's stupid- a lot of people are diagnosed with different ones by different doctors at the same time because they're just unclear and also often subjective.

First thing, it's great that you recognize that your mother's ideas are completely nuts; the next step is building up your mental walls so you can continue to eat the foods that you aren't allergic or intolerant to.  There's several ways to do this: you can stonewall with facts, you can snark back (either verbally or mentally), you can choose to grey-rock-style ignore her (i.e. reply with a neutral ""really"" or ""duly noted"" any time she tells you you're going to kill yourself with carbohydrate toxins)...the right method will depend on your relationship with your mom, your personality, and how fed up you are.

Secondly, advanced meal preparation is your best friend.  Making a big pot of chili, for instance, will give you several servings that you can portion out throughout the week, so you only have to reheat it when it's mealtime.  It seems like you're not actively trying to avoid eating in general, just the foods that trigger your aversions, so you probably don't have to worry about making sure your portion sizes are good.

Third, many people with food or texture aversions are able to slowly expand their diet by regularly trying *small* amounts of previously-scary foods.  When you feel like your anxiety, depression, ADHD, and PTSD are better controlled, you can try introducing foods to your diet, no more than 2 to 3 a week.  At the moment, it sounds like you have enough on your plate, so simply managing to nourish your body will help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really do think you should reach out to get some help. The Butterfly Foundation is really good, you can talk to online counsellors anonymously if you want something less confronting to start with. 

Personally I’ve found seeing a dietitian to be the most helpful, they’re teaching me what healthy eating is again and how I am able to eat well and maintain a healthy weight. I also recommend seeing a psychologist about this and also a doctor. It’s important to address any deficiencies you may have as a result of your eating behaviours. 

Telling your parents is definitely really hard. For me...I just outright told them, I said I have a problem and I didn’t know what to do. They’ve helped me through this...it’s good to have that support...but I believe you should do it...

I want you to know that this isn’t forever. You won’t always think this way about food. It will become a normal thing in your life again if you work hard at it.

I had a pretty similar experience in regards to my eating disorder patterns. An important thing I want to emphasize is this: an eating disorder isn’t a food disorder. Eating disorders are based off of a person’s behaviors by using food/restriction/purging to cope with an emotion. Eating disorders have a mind of their own and take advantage of someone’s struggles. It’s a mind game, a disease. An issue I had with my parents was trying to explain this to them...I have been on diets my whole life. I know what makes me lose weight, and what makes me gain. Therefore, I know what is “healthy” and “unhealthy”. An eating disorder is far more than a lack of knowledge on food. It’s not being able to feel control, feeling helpless and worthless, and hurting yourself by not taking care of yourself in a way that’s effective for your body. My parents didn’t accept or understand my eating disorder until they became educated on the reality of the disease and I took them into a recovery center for an assessment and was diagnosed a second time. It’s so easy for people who don’t have an eating disorder to say, “just eat this and do this and you’ll be ok!” But it’s so much more and if you convey that to your parents I think it’s more beneficial. ",sydsussy,1550679537.0,2019-02-20 10:18:57,"I also wanted to recommend potentially looking into getting an assessment at a recovery center near you. You can go into almost any center and get a full assessment for free. They can help to give you a better idea of what will be the most beneficial for getting help. An issue I had was not going in and getting an assessment, just to realize 7 months into Intensive outpatient that I needed a higher level of care. There is NOTHING wrong with getting help or the amount of help you may need. Getting help does require being in the mindset to want help too. I’m genuinely excited for the next steps in your journey. It’s a hard disease to work through, but I can say without a doubt that recovery has made me a better person to myself and others. I have gotten to learn a lot about my emotions and actions through this process. Recovery is a step forward, NOT a step back. Feel free to message me with questions!

From as long as I can remember I’d never eat 3 meals a day. It was always one or two and whenever we’d eat out or have something I deemed unhealthy I’d prepare for it by eating less even as a child. Restricting so heavily often times leads to binging bc your body is so deprived and has a craving and usually when your body has a craving it will eventually get it but I’m sure throughout your years of struggle you know that. I hate to break it to you but often times with the eating disorder mentality no matter how much you lose it will never be enough as unfortunate and hard to accept that may be. Trust me I know from my own experiences. I think seeing a dietician could be beneficial to you, I’m planning on seeing one soon or simply finding someone who you can talk to about it. Talking things out can be more helpful than you think, however when they genuinely care and want to help. Maybe try going for someone who specializes and understands eating disorders.

Eating disorders are rough and debilitating and I can sympathize with everything you’re saying. I recommend you see a therapist ASAP. They will be able to give you advice and strategies to normalize your eating. Honestly, therapy saved my life. It’s the best way to start your recovery. It will help you navigate the reasons why you have disordered eating thoughts as well. 

In the meantime, you might want to take small steps to at least get more food in you. For me, I started out with forcing myself to eat breakfast with high protein. I stocked up on a lot of peanut butter and protein powder to put in oatmeal and what not. When I was having a really hard time forcing myself to eat I drank Ensure shakes 2 to 3 times daily. But make sure you get the higher protein and calorie kind. Those shakes were my savior and I actually liked drinking them. 

I’m not an expert, so please make sure you talk to a therapist. Recovery is going to be a process but you’ll slowly start to feel less and less afraid of food if you put the work into it. Know that you are not alone and will get through this! Feel free to DM me if you have any questions!

Since you are eating more regularly instead of only once or twice a day, your hunger will be reeled in and the urge to binge will decrease.   


It sounds like the root of this is the restricting to only eating once or twice a day.   


For health reasons, you should find joyful ways of incorporating movement into your life, whether that is walking your dog after a meal or taking a dance class or walking through a nature center. These things can be meditative and helpful to living a balanced life.",SpinnerDieblood,1550803124.0,2019-02-21 20:38:44,"Speaking as someone who was diagnosed with BED a year ago and just finished treatment not that long ago, I would very highly recommend a more holistic eating disorder treatment program (one that treats root causes of EDs of all types) over something like Overeaters Anonymous. OE and other groups like it can often further reinforce eating disordered behavior by upholding the binary between “good” and “bad” eating or diagnosing BED as a matter of a “sugar addiction”, etc, rather than really digging into what kinds of family patterns and past traumas have led to the development of binging as a coping mechanism and treating that instead.

When I first went into an ED program (in my case, a partial hospitalization program) with people struggling with anorexia and other disorders, I thought there’s NO way we have common ground. There’s no way the normal eating disorder rhetoric applies to me/BED. I don’t need to follow the rules that govern traditional ED treatment. And I could not have been more wrong! So much ED behavior - be it restricting, binging, purging, food rituals, whatever - comes from a shared struggle to manage a life that feels unmanageable, to survive  a deeply disordered culture that alienates us from a balanced relationship with food, etc. 

Wishing you so much luck and hoping you find what you need.

It is common for people with ED's to believe that their disorder is not legitimate or that they are not sick enough to need treatment. It sounds like this is affecting your life and you need to start on the path to recovery.  


Since you can't afford therapy currently(keep in mind you might be able to find a different therapist who works on a sliding scale) you should take the following actions:  


1. Get rid of your scale, dump it, donate it, smash it, sell it, doesn't matter. Get it out of the house because it negatively affects you and will make everything harder.
2. Purchase a workbook on CBT or body image. This is an alternative to therapy since you can work through your issues step by step with some guidance. I'm currently working on ""The body image workbook"" which is an 8 step work book that is supposed to help immensely with coping with body image issues.
3. Research Tabitha Farrar on youtube, she is a recovered anorexic who speaks about how to recover from restrictive eating disorders. She is fantastic and could be a substitute for therapy in the meantime as well.  


Your issues are legitimate and need to be taken after. You are strong and you will get through this. Please ask any other questions if you have any.

451,aw3duj,baddspellar,1551439300.0,2019-03-01 05:21:40,"Eating enough for your activity level is essential, regardless of whether you have a history of eating disorders. Many athletes who compete at the highest levels have struggled with this *without* having any symptoms of an eating disorder. The diagnostic criteria for eating disorders involve eating behaviors, intent, and attitudes, not weight.

That leads in to my answer to your question about how much exercise is too much. It is not the quantity of exercise, but your related behaviors, intent, and attitudes. When I had AN, overexercise was one of my behaviors. To get well, I had to stop for some time. It has been many years, and today I train more hours than I ever did when I was sick. I run marathons and long distance trail races, and I compete in long distance swimming events. I have friends who have competed at the highest levels of sport, including competing and national and world championships, and even the olympics. They trained even more. 

The primary difference between now and then is my attitudes and intents. When I was sick, I organized my day around my workout. Now I fit my training into my day. Back then I felt I *had* to run. Skipping a day left me feeling guilty and out of control. If I can't get to it because something interferes, or I have something better to do, it doesn't bother me at all. Quantity is not my goal. If I have a big race coming up, I taper (back way off) and take days completely off so I can have better performance. 

Exercise addiction is real. Like eating disorders, a major part of exercise addiction is a strong need for control. I do have to make accommodations for the way my brain is wired. I pay close attention to my volume and I take days off if I feel I've been doing too much. I'll even randomly take days off, just to make sure my workouts aren't controlling me. I avoid or back out of conversations about training with people  who exhibit signs of exercise addictions.

From what you describe, I suspect you are using exercise as you might have used eating behaviors in the past. I encourage you to watch this. If you can, talk to a therapist about this. If that's not possible try to go out of your way to back off s long as it takes to approach workouts with a healthier attitude. Take days off. The gym environment may not be the best for you. There are a *lot* of compulsive exercises at gyms. Even I am uncomfortable there. Consider getting some of your exercise in a more social, relaxed environment. Things like hiking with a group, playing a team sport, joining a casual running group, or similar, where the social aspect is at least as important than the actual workout.",MyMorningSun,1551447991.0,2019-03-01 07:46:31,"""Too much"" exercise can mean a lot of things. You wouldn't say Serena Williams or Michael Phelps or whoever exercise too much, but the difference is that they a) eat enough to make up for it and b)do so with a purpose and c) are able to rest when needed.

I'm seeing problems in your description with all three. Firstly, exercise is never a cure all, but if you feel sluggish or not your best in anyway, that needs to be addressed. It may be time to back off a bit, recover, and try again. Or supplement your diet with additional snacks, protein, or more food in your regular meals. The only way you can determine if you are eating enough for your activity level is to use an online calculator and measure them, but I would caution you against that (it may trigger a slip back into disordered eating patterns). Instead, what I would suggest is just eating more for now. Add a bit more to your meals and see how it makes you feel. Protein shakes and bars are great for this, as they fill in a lot of macros and have a functional purpose as well. Add servings of fruits and veggies to your meals, which are also great as they are nutrient dense, and at least IME with people with EDs, the lower calorie/nutrient balance makes them more appealing and easy to eat (mentally easy, that is). 

A second thing- you do a lot of training, but for what? You need to identify that to determine if there's an underlying problem. Are you training for something? Do you just have a lot of fun with it? Or is this symptomatic of your history with poor self-image/self esteem? It's a very important distinction to make, because it'll determine your ease in either backing off or being able to eat more. Have you sought out professional help yet? Especially with a medical doctor- but counseling or psychological help will become crucial in dealing with these mental boundaries. I have difficulty with backing off myself- not due to an ED issue, but sometimes I do experience periods of low self-esteem like anybody else, and I've also been training for an athletic event for a while now. It's not easy to tell yourself what to do, but sometimes you have to parent your body like you would a child. ""No, you cannot do this. Eat your veggies/protein. Go to the doctor and tell him honestly what your problem is."" This sounds simplistic enough, but I know it's not easy- if it is still difficult, I encourage you to either speak to a counselor or therapist, or contact and ED hotline. These are great resources and very accessible if you need a last-minute bit of convincing. This is a big mental health issue- like any physical issue, it requires the help of a professional to recover from.

The biggest thing in your post that concerns me regarding your attititude towards exercise is that you can't get past a day of inactivity. That should be a red flag for you- why is that? Are you afraid of gaining weight as a result, or overeating, or not making up for the calories you've taken in? If so, then it sounds to me like you're still suffering from an ED. Most people do for a very long time- years, decades, their whole lives. Of course, everyone is different- but what I've noticed is that while habits change, disordered eating patterns and unhealthy relationships with food and exercise persist, but in different forms. Before you were focused on calories/carbs and ran a lot of it off. Now, you eat more, but you've replaced that same obsessive need for control over your body through exercise. The amount of exercise is irrelevant- if you hear of people here on this sub doing ""A LOT"" more, that isn't a qualifier of what is ""too much"" for you, or what may be problematic for you in terms of your physical and mental well being. That you've been comparing your own habits to those of others here is very telling as well. An ED isn't measured by the calories we eat or the amount of exercise we do- it's measured by our mental state. An obsession we have with control or looking a certain way. The (mental and emotional) side effects of losing that control. It doesn't matter what other people are doing or what symptoms they have- it matters what *you* are doing, and the symptoms *you* have are very real. 

From what it sounds like, your ED is continuing in a new form. Here on this sub, we can offer support and direct you to resources, but we cannot always offer tailored professional advice. IMO, I think you're suffering from a mix of inadequate nutrition, inadequate sleep, and overwork for your body (rest days are important!)- but these are the only physical problems anyone will be able to identify for you here (which you already know for yourself). The solution, therefore, is to ease up your routine, add to your diet, and get enough sleep. However, given your situation,  I strongly suggest you contact a) your GP or a medical professional for your physical symptoms and b) a therapist, counselor, or other mental health professional to help you cope in the long term. You may need a referral from a GP depending on your insurance or country of residence. I cannot stress the importance of seeking out mental health professionals. It's fantastic to see you're eager to get things back on track and be healthy (mentally as well)- but it will require some action in the mental health arena as well. Feel free to PM me if you would like help identifying local resources or have specific questions that you don't feel posting for all to see. ",problematicbeing,1551468585.0,2019-03-01 13:29:45,"The other comments are very useful.  


You mentioned you need to gain weight, gaining weight and intensely exercising 7 days a week are not compatible. It sounds like you are facing orthorexia, in that you said you want the ""perfect diet"" and compulsive overexercise.   


To treat both of those, you will eventually need to be cease those behaviors- eating foods that are not typically thought of as ""healthy"" or ""unprocessed"" to challenge the orthorexia. Additionally to challenge the overexercise, you will need to at some point be able to stop exercise completely for a period of time. You should work with an eating disorder therapist and a Non-weightloss dietitian to create a plan to tackle the behaviors as well as handle the emotions that come with.  


This is ""too much"" exercise, you are in a body that needs to gain weight to be healthy and you have an eating disorder. Exercise is not healthy for everyone at every point in their life. Exercise =/= good. Exercising frequently does not make you morally better, nor does not exercising make you morally worse. You will need to unlearn the feeling that exercise =good and more exercise = even better because it will always be destructive to your health if you believe you are worse person if you work out less.  


  
Side note- I 100% believe exercise and movement can and should be part of a full/healthy life, but I also strongly believe that you need to have the ability to allow yourself to take a break, a month, a year, 3 years, from exercise to determine if your relationship with it is healthy. If you simply cannot allow yourself to take 1 year off from exercise, ask yourself why? If it is related your eating disorder, then take that year off to heal and repair your relationship with movement. Exercise should come from a desire to move, not societal pressures or eating disordered compulsions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From what you wrote, it seems like all weight loss attempts have lead to restriction, reactive binging(because if you restrict, you will eventually eat for that hunger/deprivation), and ending up back at the weight your body is at now. Purposeful weight loss attempts have consistently resulted in disordered activity around food.  


Remove numbers from your life, don't read the nutrient labels or count your calories burnt or weigh yourself. You've identified those as triggers and they have no place in your life.  


It's not everyone's cup of tea, but educating yourself on HAES(health at any size), anti-diet culture, and set point can be really freeing. I listen to ""The Food Pysch Podcast"" and they discuss how to break free from diet culture, aka the mindset of smaller bodies are always better and people should always be dieting and losing weight 'for their health', and intuitive eating ect.   


Lastly, rather than taking things away, like cream in your coffee or other things, add things in. Try to increase your intake of fruits and veggies that you enjoy a few servings every day.

I started my Ed as a way to avoid preventable diseases (cardiovascular, gi, hormonal, etc...). In my mind, Ed truly makes me physically healthier than if I didn't eat or exercise with an Ed. 

How can I convince my brain otherwise?",covhr,1551288879.0,2019-02-27 11:34:39,"Well, one way is to understand that exercise should be seen is along a continuum, not ""black"" or ""white"". 

When I was exercising compulsively (I won't say what I was doing or how much, but suffice it to say that it was VERY unhealthy), I was exercising every day, even while sick, even in the snow/sleet/rain/heat. I occasionally (not often, but sometimes) took time off of work so I could exercise sufficiently. 

I got to the point that I had bradycardia (low heart rate) and osteoporosis. All before the age of 40! Not to mention all sorts of other things that were wrong with my blood levels. 

Normal people exercise, but normal people do not skip meals when they cannot exercise. Normal people do not skip work to exercise. Normal people skip exercise when the weather is bad. Normal people skip exercise when they are sick.

It's laudable to want to avoid preventable diseases. But it's possible (even LIKELY) to avoid those diseases while you're at a healthy BMI, rather than underweight.

Your body will actually lose weight (or maintain weight if that is your goal) more efficiently if you take a rest day and eat more calories than your other days. 

If you workout and diet all 7 days a week, your body sees that as the norm. It no longer acts like your intake is a deficit- it will slow its metabolism in order to adjust. (In extreme cases, this is referred to ""Starvation mode"", where your body thinks it is starving so it massively slows its metabolism to cope.)

If you have cheat/rest days where you eat more, it actually boosts your metabolism since your body is reminded that no, that calorie intake is not the norm.

There has been research on this, and I've found it to be personally true as well (there was a period of time where I wasnt losing weight despite constantly working out. I then implemented a cheat day every 5 days and I began losing weight again!)

When I went vegan, I went cold turkey. That was bad. I fell sick and lost a lot of weight (I was already underweight...). It took me about 3 months to find something that worked. But my stomach didnt get used to it for a few months agter too. So i would gradually lose my appetite and eat even less than before. 

Vegans have now a lot of options to choose from. You should find a dietician or doctor that knows about particular diets and can guide you into what you can add to your intakes to make sure you keep a balanced macro with more calories. Be careful of calories-rich food as they may upset your stomach if you are not used to them.

I guess I was surprised to have this hunger because I began weight restoring back in September and I am at the same weight I was pre-ED. I have not been eating much below the recommended number of calories in the last three or so months, and from September to around December I was eating much more, sometimes twice as much. I would have thought that, since I was eating regularly, a ""normal"" amount of food would have been enough, especially considering my weight is the same as it was before this whole mess started.

Granted, when I developed my eating disorder, I was \~15 years old, so I might have needed to gain a little more.

Honestly... I guess I'm just struggling with accepting the fact I eat a lot, and that I may need to gain more weight. I have read that ""overshoot"" can happen in recovery; would you say this is true?

That's exactly how I feel-- the thought of gaining is terrifying, but I don't have a life when I'm constantly thinking of how much I've had and how much I really could eat if I just didn't try to stick within my ""calorie limit"".

Hoping for the best with you",Bomby57,1551314108.0,2019-02-27 18:35:08,"Don't worry, it can be confusing when you have life changes! 

Some people indeed tend to gain 'a lot' of weight in recovery. It's not necessarily that they have bad habits or that they do something wrong. It's just that since your body has been used to starvation, it grasps everything it can from the food you eat. It takes time to adjust. Maybe years for some people, it depends on many things. 

The mental struggle is normal. ED will always trick you and make you feel like you're doing wrong. ""Am I eating too much?"" ""Should I exercise more?"" ""Why does this body part feel different?"". If you're following therapy, you should be able to have a GP or dietician that knows enough about your ED to explain to you why this step is important. 

But in case you don't have this person, here are multiple reasons. First, you need to change your relationship with food and accept it as normal and not a shameful thing. Second, you need to change your relationship with your body. And third you need to learn how to make those relationships change. By cooking or eating the foods you avoided. By going out to new places or have carefree binges. This is going to be temporary. 

And indeed, at 15 your body is growing. You're usually developing until you're ~23 years old so the lack of nutrient during that time might trigger a lot of reaction when you finally nourish yourself again. Including extreme chemical reactions in your brain, close to taking drugs sometimes. 

Do not worry too much about it. Overthinking is going to bring you stress and stress sometimes induce bad decisions. We are here to support you and you'll always have a place to vent :) I'm so proud of you for restoring your weight!

Even though my ed was anorexia, I did begin to binge/restrict when I started recovery. The best best best thing you can do is ""do normal"". Learn to draw a clear line between ed behaviour, and you behaviour, and do ""you behaviour"". Bingeing is ed behaviour, and it sucks, but it's ok. Don't beat yourself up, you are trying to recover and you need to keep aiming fir that, whatever it looks like to you rn.

Don't restrict because you binged, that will only lead to further cycles of binging and restricting, because they are ed behaviours. Don't weigh yourself either, weighing yourself is another ed behaviour. You will obviously weigh more after you eat because there's more stuff in you, but that will be inconsequential in the long term, so think about what the urge to weigh yourself accomplishes, and ask if it's productive for you. (Nothing is necessarily inherently bad or good, but ask yourself if X behaviour is good for YOU for where you are at. I weigh myself sometimes, and keep track of calorie intake, but that's to make sure I'm not losing weight and that I'm eating enough. In the past, it absolutely would not have been a good idea to weigh myself/calorie count.

Be kind to yourself. Slip ups happen and they feel fucking bad, but try to keep the big picture in your mind. When I look back at my ed, especially when I was bingeing/restricting, I know that was an important part of my recovery. After starving myself for so long, my body was like ""omg food"", then my ed brain retaliated. Eventually I learnt how to deal with it, and learning how to deal with it is recovery. Recovery isnt being healthy and normal all of a sudden, it's being able to choose YOU even when the eating disorder turns up the volume in your life. Cheese warning: recovery is the journey, not the end point.

Your treatment team is best-equipped to make decisions regarding your therapy plan.  But there's no harm in asking, especially if you know it's something that helped you move in a positive direction before.  If you do approach your family therapist about getting some individual help, I'd recommend being prepared to explain how it helped your recovery in inpatient and what you hope to get out of it that you aren't getting in family therapy.   

In the meantime, could you use the family therapy setting to express the thoughts from your 2nd paragraph?  It's easy for someone who hasn't experienced an ED to assume that healing the body automatically heals the mind.

Its scary, I know, but obsessing about this weight gain isn't healthy at all and isn't recovery. Being a tiny bit overweight does not mean you are not completely healthy or attractive.

This is definitely something you need to stop. There are very few ways of losing weight and you have to be very careful in how you approach them as an ex-ED sufferer. 

The first one is portion reduction. Less food = less calories = less weight. You need to plan a SMALL reduction, maybe 10-20% less calories for a start. The weight should be lost slowly, about 250g to 500g per week (~2lbs per month). Try to sustain it for a long time. Weight loss is not a speed race, it's a marathon. 

The second method is exercising more. I would be EXTREMELY careful with that. Overexercising is common in EDs. You say that you exercise already daily. I wouldn't encourage to exercise more than 45-60 minutes per day, maximum. 30 minutes per day is ideal for your joints apparently. 

The last method would be to change your diet. Eat the same portions but with food that has lower calories. Instead of eating meat, eat vegetarian alternatives. Instead of eating food with high sodium, find the low sodium alternatives. Instead of eating cereals, eat oatmeal, etc. Similarly to the first point, you have to make sure this doesn't become a disordered behaviour. Make sure that your intakes are balanced and enough to sustain your exercise too. If you want to see alternate products, you can use the application named Yuka. It will show you foods with less sodium, sugar, carbs from the products you scan.

It took me two years to realize my behaviors were not normal or healthy. I didn't register the alarmed looks from high school friends, but I did start to feel like something was just off.

Wanting to lose weight is not in and of itself harmful but what you're describing... sounds like you know what's up. And that's half the battle right there.

The few days I try to allow myself no calories counting or no restrictive eating/purging, I just feel so bad (physically) and guilty that I always just prefer doing it anyway. 

I don't know what to tell you, probably looking for a professional therapy is the best, if that is an option for you. 

EDs can start any time in life, but the signs start at earlier ages. I've always engaged into disordered eating even though I had no idea the extent of the disorder. I've been avoiding certain foods more and more and I feel sad whenever I think about food now. It's become such an obsession, I never even realized it until my co-worker and friend told me ""you talk about food A LOT"". I do, in various ways, but all obsessive. One day I want to eat everything on the surface of the earth, the next day I want to kill myself because I ate 10 calories over budget. 

Anyway, all the best to you, support and early therapy has proven success. The earlier an ED is addressed, the higher the success rate, so it's time to turn it around, now. ",mgb_II,1552344279.0,2019-03-11 17:44:39,"I fell into a similar situation when I started college. I started pushing the upper limits of normal weight in high school, and my solution was always to starve myself so I'd lose weight. In college, that became calorie counting and excessive exercise even when I would only eat 800 calories for the entire day, and then massive binges when I slipped up or reached a weight I liked and told myself I could eat whatever I wanted. I spent all my time in between meals thinking about the next meal, and constantly felt self-conscious when I ate even a normal amount of anything (binges made me practically hate myself). 

I've seen this pattern in myself and a number of my friends and family members; when we starve ourselves, we binge. It used to be evolutionarily advantageous to do this, because back when starving meant there was an actual food shortage, finding food meant that you should stuff your face to no end because you never know when you'd get food again. It is *so* toxic, and I am so sorry you seem to be dealing with it too. 

First, please know that everything will be okay, and that being aware of your own behavior is *so* important and the monumental first step in getting better.

Second, my biggest advice would be not to count calories. Some people can do it and be fine; maybe you're one of them, but it made me extremely toxic to myself. My theory is that counting calories makes us conceptualize food not in terms of what we *want* to eat, but what we *can* eat, so on days where we say we can eat whatever we want, we just never stop eating (since we no longer have a conception of how much we want). It also just made me worry about all the small things like glasses of orange juice or how much of individual chocolate bars I ate, and eating just became a really negative experience for me. Eating slowly and taking my time to chew has been much more helpful in preventing myself from overeating while helping me not ridicule myself for the smallest eating decisions all the time. Also, I found that the starve-binge cycle wasn't really sustainable, as whenever I lost the weight I wanted to, I'd gain it all right back almost immediately and all my suffering was for naught. Lifestyle changes don't come with nearly as fast results, which is why I fought them for the longest time, but they really are much better ways to be nice to your body without feeling starving or compelled to binge. 

Third, be nice to yourself. Falling out of a habit like this doesn't happen over night, and if you accidentally overeat one day it won't be the end of the world; the most important thing is that you're trying, and that you're constantly practicing to find eating patterns healthy for you. Remind yourself that you love yourself no matter what you've eaten on a given day, how you see yourself in the mirror, or how full you feel.

I hope this was helpful and that I didn't seem to be wrongly projecting my experience onto yours; best of luck in what you're going through, and if you ever want someone to talk to you about what you're going through you can always feel free to message me :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You still aren’t eating enough and you are not dealing with the psychological roots of your ED. Until you confront the root of your issue, recovery is out of reach. 

Your significant other is actually enabling you in a way; giving you just enough nutrition to keep you going and avoid the consequences of your unhealthy mindset and behavior. You acknowledge this as you say if he didn’t put food in front of you, you would starve yourself. 
Your loved ones can support you, but they can’t do all the work of keeping you alive. That’s too much to ask if anyone. You need to find your own motivation to live. 

The first step is to find a dietician who works with people who have eating disorders to make sure you actually get enough calories and macros to feed your body properly. Then you need to see a therapist to help you work out why you hate yourself so much that you think you deserve to starve/binge/purge. 

I’m telling you this as someone who is best friends with someone who battles an eating disorder. There was a point where I was making dinner for her every single day but somehow she would not gain weight or would keep losing it. This was very difficult for me to witness because I felt I was trying so, so hard to help her, but because she wouldn’t help herself, she was still drowning. It wasn’t until I told her how I felt about the situation that she realized that no matter how many supportive people she had in her life; her friends, her parents, her therapist; it didn’t matter because she was refusing to put her own work into recovery and relying on everyone else in her life to keep her fed and alive. It was a major turning point and we’ve had ups and downs together but she’s in a much better place now and I’m so happy she loved me enough to hear me out and choose herself and the people she loved over her eating disorder. I truly hope you can do the same! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a lot of pressure on men where I come from too so I am suggesting this based on my male friend’s  experience.

It’s really common for people recovering from anorexia to do so. After so long restricting, having messed up satiety cues are inevitable (satiety is the feeling of satisfaction after a normal amount of food and is as intuitive a cue as when you feel hungry or full). That’ll come in time if you eat what you want, when you want, and start to trust your internal hunger cues. Eat when your body wants to, basically, and try to get back in touch with what it wants, not what you think you should want. Also, a year is likely not enough time to rebuild the damage you did to your body during your illness, so the “overeating” is also likely a normal response to supplying your body with fuel more reliably. It’s also kind of tricky because a lot of times people with illnesses that centre around restriction sometimes misinterpret eating normal amounts of food as (objective) binges when they’re really just a larger amount of food than you’re used to eating (a subjective binge). Also it might be helpful to more carefully pay attention to when these “binges” happen, as you might not be eating enough beforehand and then of course your urge to eat a lot to compensate will happen. 

This is just my experience in recovery from a restrictive disorder. Of course consult an ED therapist and dietician ultimately as I can only guess and I’m not a professional.

That's another suggestion I haven't read yet. Keep a food diary of what you're eating and how you're feeling on a day to day basis. This should help you to keep track of your habits and to see what might trigger a binge or starvation day. Could your parents help you with meal preps? What S-T said seems like it would really help also.

I kinda noticed that myself. In my ""clean eating"" style, where i have sessions and fixated timing to eat... and the need to have fruits and vegetables daily... kind of habits. (despite it giving me problems)

same goes for coffee, which... media recommends to cut down or quit... at least for the good of health.

I struggled with a binge eating disorder very similar to yours where I would restrict and then binge. I feel like we've been programmed to think certain foods are healthy and other foods are not. I've actually found that if I go against this programming and eat foods like butter, eggs, bacon, and red meat, I become satiated on less calories and have absolutely no desire to binge. A lot of your food that you listed is high in carbohydrate, you occasionally eat a little bit of protein but without the animal fat you are unable to derive proper nutrition. I'm guessing the chicken that you eat is usually boneless skinless chicken breast not cooked in very much fat. Honestly I think chicken is relatively inferior as far as meat goes, not to mention most chickens in Western industrialized societies are not raised in the most Humane conditions. Beef, especially grass-finished beef if you can find it has a much higher quality of life and their meat yields a higher nutritional value. I would also recommend looking into purchasing lard or tallow. You can find very high quality lard and Tallow online for relatively cheap for a large amount. Also look into the benefits of eating nose to tail, which means eating something other than muscle meat, such as organs like liver. I know it sounds kind of crazy but this is the only thing that works for me. It also helped me with other issues such as insomnia, anxiety, and depression.",sydneyd22,1552881968.0,2019-03-17 23:06:08,"I'm 15 as well and 5'2"". It feels really good to know someone else is going through the same thing. I am also terrified of weight gain. I've been ""skinny"" up until December of 2015 where I started binge eating. Ever since then, I've been on the upper range of a healthy BMI for my height. 

I got into fasting too... Big mistake.  

It's really tough because there's all this ""science"" promoting fasting as a health tool, not as what it is - a disordered eating behavior. I'm in the same stage as you right now: Realization. I'm going to be deleting all apps dedicated to any fasting/calorie tracking as well as podcasts who do nothing but talk about it. What really helped me when I first did all this (this is a relapse) was deleting all social media (especially Instagram), with the exception of Reddit and Twitter since they both provide support and aren't as focused on the physical/weight side of things.

This is a challenging journey, but starting is better than avoiding it our whole lives and living in a self-sabotaging prison. I'm beginning to realize life is too short to count every calorie and eat within an ""8 hour window or else my health will slowly wither away"" (much like my sanity doing this!).

This is something you can try right away, there are tons of mindfulness techniques on the internet and it is proven to help with BED.  


Also, here are a few good tips you can try right away:  


1.) Make a daily schedule - what will you do before breakfast? What are your plans throughout the day? Don’t let your boredom or free time provoke your binging. Be prepared for every hour of the day, every day!

  
  2.) Try to contemplate first on why you want to eat these amounts of food and why do you buy it. Is it because of your negative emotions (emotional eating)? If so, what are those emotions? Try to be mindful, don't just blame yourself for eating and failing, try to acknowledge why you do that and learn about [self-regulation theory.](https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/self-regulation/) 

  
3.) When you experience cravings and if you already think you failed and preparing for binging, give yourself 20 - 30 minutes before proceeding with it. Be smart and find yourself something to do within these 20 minutes. Anything but waiting for it to pass and thinking about food and binging. Take a cold shower, read a book, go for a 20 minutes walk. I assure you, your cravings will be less intense. Sometimes they’ll be gone entirely and sometimes not, but they will be much less intensive. And that is your opportunity. It will be much easier to fight and beat your cravings that way. And you will have much more success.

  
4.)  Also, education about food addiction and BED is crucial. You need to understand what is going on in your head and your body. Here is a [great and free mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=life.devicer.devicer) where you can learn everything there is to be learned about food addiction and BED and how to cope, within 90-day therapy.

  
5.) Surround with people who support you. Open yourself to others. It is much easier to cope when you have someone to talk to.

I did a lot of looking into Laxatives and I know that they're really not good for you. If you are taking them as regularly as u say I'd ease myself off them. With most stuff like this if u stop having a crutch it kinda forces you to eat a little better. I know the guilt is immense but I'm sure if you just keep a strict journal or tally of how many you take a week and gradually reduce that number you will be okay.

I've never taken laxatives myself for ED stuff but I know it's a really really unhealthy habit. Binging is awful I know but if you start to feel any pain or start actually needing to use them instead of wanting to go straight to the doctor. I think that being aware that they're not so great is a good first step anyway so you're already doing good!

If you already see a therapist for binging pls mention this :( Because it can give you more like idk how to put it?

Find a want that's true to you—to go to a place, to meet a person, to make music or art, cook or pat your cat. These are your way up and out, they're the positives that make the fight worth fighting.

All of this means you are not thinking clearly. There is almost NEVER an ""I'm ready!"" moment when it comes to ED's. The very nature of the illness is an intense fear of gaining weight.

As a cautionary tale: my sister (recovered anorexic, recovering bulimic) relies on running as you rely on gym time, for stress relief and for a constant.  Then she tore a ligament during a run and was told in *no uncertain terms* that she had to lay off the running for several weeks so she could heal properly and that trying to run before she healed would just make it worse.  With her primary stress relief unavailable to her, she relapsed.  Badly.

I’ve had my ED since I was 18 and body issues my whole life. Now I’m almost 27 and I will say that although my BN is a no longer at the forefront- the evil pounding of image and self hate knock on my door constantly. 

This past summer was the worst, dealing with depression, while forcing myself to go for runs, barely making it a mile or even out the door. Finally I found a routine that was good for me joining ClassPass (if you never heard of this and live in a city I highly recommend checking it out)- this gave me a TON of flexibility to have fun working out that made it less of a weight on my back and just a can do feel good attitude. 

Unfortunately I just got back from a long 3 week vacation, where my ED has a way of constricting my bowls while away... Not to mention that the food intake is through the roof as I’m just trying to enjoy myself, drinks with dinner every night, and a lack of healthy foods in general because of where I am in the world making for a super self conscious me. 

Sure I’m walking a lot and eating less snacks but it’s still hard for me to get up in those situations and get home knowing that I feel so bloated, so full, and so defeated. 

Every picture I look at from the trip makes me feel so disgusted. I hate that I have these thoughts because when I’m feeling good and I’m taking care of myself I truly love my body. The amazing vessel that it is and all the things it does. Yet conflicted with self doubt. 

I wish there was a switch I could hit in my brain and just feel confident no matter what. That a little puffiness in the gut and enjoyment of foods on vacation could be normal. 

I like the idea of writing, so I decided to seek something here on reddit. This is my first post or response and I’m here trying to work through this. 

I’m hoping this can be a first step into a better recovery through my late 20s.

This is about thinking right, ensuring that you can dismiss unwelcome thoughts, and examine your choices clearly. 

To achieve that you need two or three things:

1. Good sleep. An early bedtime and good sleep hygiene (no dragging late into the night with blue light from a cellphone screen) will improve your thinking (and help your running!)

2. Food. You already know this but it's even more important than you think—your brain will quickly stop operating well without fuel. Make it easy for a moment of mental strength to succeed—find a way to get good, nutritious food in your cupboard.

3. Companionship. Isolation is critical to avoid, it'll loop your thinking and make it harder to find joy. Book time with friends asap, and if there are some you trust, be open with them and let them support you.

Don't delay, the sooner you can get your mind working 100% the better. Best wishes!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\- Are you watching weight loss videos and cooking shows for distraction?  Or are you actively looking for new ideas?

The advice, I will give, as someone who has an eating disorder, as someone who has tried the whole ""intuitive eating recovery journey,"" resulting in worse anxiety and depression, and as someone who gets you and knows what you need to hear right now, amid the panic: chances are you aren't going to gain permanent weight, and are experiencing a short period of time, whether it be one or two weeks, or even two months, where you crave sugar, and where you feel ""weak"", as far as self control. The cravings will end, your motivation to continue restricting will return, and you will again feel high off the self control you possess. 

If you're ready to put the eating disorder to bed, and embark on a recovery journey, I applaud you, and truly advise you to study intuitive eating. Listen to Christy Harrison's podcast Food Psych. It will provide you with IMMEDIATE relief. You will literally sigh with relief that there is a world outside dieting, and that it's okay to have fat and be fat.

But if you're not ready to recover, don't beat yourself up about that. It's okay if you don't have enough support right now to let go of the eating disorder. It's okay if this is what you need right now. Don't worry about the future (gaining weight, or recovery.) Focus on the now: Enjoy your cravings, binge on donuts. And tell yourself ""Next week I'll diet."" I may get some backlash with that, but it's what's worked for my sanity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You do not have to be a certain weight to have a disorder. Disordered eating can occur at any weight or size. Cutting recommended daily needs in half is a sizable restriction and you’re depleting your body. Disordered eating comes in so many different packages, but these do sound like disordered habits. Especially if it’s something that is affecting your personal/social/professional life or just taking up a lot of brain space. ",MeleKalikimakaYall,1553916674.0,2019-03-29 22:31:14,"If you are posting here at all then you should probably at least ask a doctor or therapist about it. I'm no diagnostician but honestly what you're describing sounds disordered. No matter what weight you are, restricting your calories to half the daily minimum is not healthy; it is highly doubtful that you are getting all the required nutrients at that calorie count and is probably not sustainable. 

&amp;#x200B;

What concerns me to the most is when you talk about enjoying the control. While it is a natural human attribute to enjoy being in control and on top of things, a need for control is often the crux of an eating disorder. For me, even if I didn't recognize it, it certainly was; I was a neurotic, overcommitted mess and felt like I was a slave to my obligations but restricting my food made me feel in control. However, my brain fell into certain patterns so that even after I shed the responsibilities that were driving me crazy, the disordered eating was still there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that worries me about your post is that it sounds like you are trying to justify it. Eating disorders will try to do everything they can at first to convince you that you don't have one, especially if you're overweight. It will tell you how healthy you are, it will point out the compliments you're been getting from people on the weight loss, it will tell you that the second you reach that target weight, all of this will be over. Maybe right now you don't want to see your ribs but a couple months from now, that may not be the case. But brain patterns aren't that easy to reverse. Once you realize that you have a disorder, it will do everything that it can to convince you that you are not sick enough. It will tell you that you're not underweight or if you are underweight, it will tell you that you're not underweight enough. It will tell you that you haven't had it long enough or that the health defects haven't been severe enough. It will tell you that you can still get all the nutrients you need while severely restricting your calories. 

&amp;#x200B;

So to answer your question, mere concern is ""enough"" for you to look into getting treatment for an ED. I'm not saying that you definitely have an ED and I'm not saying that pursuing a healthy weight isn't a good thing, but if you have even the slightest suspicion, reach out now. You don't want to have to get help when it has already begun ruining your life. ",Lilith-Rising,1553948198.0,2019-03-30 07:16:38,Is it functional? Or are the negative consequences from your actions?

There are generally thee paths in any situation: 

1) changing it
2) learning how to tolerate it
3) staying the same


**1)** - you can try to set good boundaries with your mom (i.e. Use a DEAR MAN skill to structure a conversation and set a boundary).  It may go something like this:

* ""I notice that I receive a lot of comments on my body, what I eat, and my exercise habits. When I hear those comments, I start to think I'm not good enough and it can trigger a cycle of thoughts that lead to restriction. I think this is putting a rift between us. If those comments could stop, I think we'd be able to be even closer and happier.  I know it can be hard to make a change and there might be some slips, but if a comment is made, I'm going to politely ask if we can change the topic. If they still happen, I'll have to leave dinner/hang up/etc.)

Remember - the most important thing about setting a boundary is holding the line. If you say you will leave/hang up if x happens, you MUST do it. If you don't, the person learns that your boundaries aren't real and it becomes very hard to set one because they will constantly challenge it. 

**2)** It might be helpful to sit down with a therapist and ask why your mom is so triggering? The world says comments like these all the time, but there are often very specific reasons why those words are more hurtful coming from someone who is 'supposed' to be our biggest support.  Learning about why your reactions are what they are and how you might develop skills to be more resilient in the face of them will be important. 

3) It's always an option to stay the same but I can see you want change - so that's a good thing! 

Wishing you luck! ",problematicbeing,1553874639.0,2019-03-29 10:50:39,"Setting boundaries will be very important- ""Mom, I need you to not talk about food, dieting, bodies, weight, or size around me, are you able to do that? If you are not able to agree to this, I am sorry but I will need to distance myself from you for my health."" If she agrees, then you still need to advocate for yourself, if she says something like ""How is your diet going?"" you have to say ""Mom you agreed to not bring this up, we are going to stop talking about this"" Shooting her down like that will gradually train her to know that those topics are truly and fully off limits and none of her business.

&amp;#x200B;

If she keeps it up, she is showing clear disrespect for you and your boundaries and it would be reasonable to distance yourself from her, or cut contact entirely. You are under no obligation to keep people in your life who are hurting you.   


  
Also, educating yourself on diet culture might help ease the pain of hearing comments like the above because you will know they come from a deep routed cultural obsession that moralizes food and exercise.

But one of the reasons was because I didn't feel like I was sick enough to deserve treatment and help despite thinking about calories, food, and exercising ALL DAY LONG.  I would get anxiety and feel guilt if I felt like I ate too much, and I felt like these things weren't enough to deserve getting help.

The connection I'm trying to make is that when you say you're trying to torture/hurt yourself through your eating habits, that that is pretty much what I did too.  But for me it was because me symptoms didn't feel severe enough to warrant help, and for that I felt the need to make myself more sick by restricting myself from food more.

Then as time went on I felt an attachment towards this behavior despite the fact that I was miserable, simply because I was not gaining weight and I knew I could lose more and more weight if I continued to restrict.  I've always hated the way that I've looked, so at the end of the day, I was getting something good out of this.

I felt SOME form of power over people who were prettier than me and had better bodies than me, because AT LEAST I was eating less than them, since food is something that I can't control, and my ability to restrict made me feel powerful and above people in some way despite still feeling ugly and fat.

I'm a guy BTW, not that it matters.  And I'm in college.

I can't diagnose you but the exact diagnosis doesn't matter, what does matter is that your treatment is addressing the issues that cause you distress.

There are also eating disorders that have nothing to do with body image or weight/shape concern. They can be more about avoiding food as a way to help control other hard emotions or situations. Sometimes when this type of eating disorder happens, people can report having 'no taste for food'.

What you see in the mirror isn't what other people see when they look at you; they see your body as it is that moment, but you see years and decades of disappointment and expectation piled up on top of yourself.  


My advice is to stop trusting mirrors (your view of your own body) and start trusting the people who love you in your life and the nice things they say (or the warnings they give). Easier said than done, I know.  


But to your question, body image issues aren't instantly eating disorders, but the one can definitely lead to the other; if you start to get worried or have any physical symptoms like being dizzy/light headed/extremely tired, don't hesitate to see a therapist or a doctor.

I’m sure you can see that you have an anxiety of gaining weight and that is 1) affecting you now 2) unsustainable - you cannot happily carry this fear for the rest of your life, and it will not be enough of a deterrent against eating too much for the rest of your life if you have now or ever have in the future, an emotional relationship with food. 
Anyone here could tell you that these things are horribly ineffective ways to manage weight, and they come at a high cost of mental, physical health and wellbeing in many or all facets of your life. It will be even more awful to deal with if you do gain weight. 

We don’t know enough about you nor are we qualified on reddit to give you a diagnosis but I would say that clearly, you have fear and anxiety surrounding your weight, body image, handling food.

548,b9p4fl,problematicbeing,1554488983.0,2019-04-05 13:29:43,"The  way to stop the binge restrict cycle is to stop restricting. The restriction prompts binging due to prior restriction and having 'forbidden' food types. Basically, anything you would normally binge on needs to stop being forbidden, you tell yourself 'I can have however much of this I want, and If I want to eat this food 12 times today, I will"" and then follow through. It is important to make peace with this though, because if you still judge it harshly and hate yourself for eating the food 12 times a day, you are still mentally restricting it and it might lead to more binges rather than leveling out your desire for that food. You basically want to train your body to realize 'this food is always available and I am always allowed to have it' and often, after allowing yourself to eat it unrestricted and make peace with it, you'll eventually get kinda meh about it. It's no longer a ""Now or Never"" feeling towards food that leads to binging.   


&amp;#x200B;

I'd also reccomend seeing a professional to help you work through this because you likely have uncomfortable feelings around food/eating/body and they can help you work to change that and make peace with your body and eating.

I have binge eating disorder and i’m overweight. 
The past year i have been focusing on dieting. I just ended up trying to stick to my restrictions that it would just lead to more and more binges. 

Recently, i haven’t been focused on losing weight. I’ve been focusing on just eating portion sizes, actually sitting and feeling these moods that lead me to a binge, my environment before a binge. What am I doing, what am i thinking? why do i want to eat? is questions i’ve asked myself and found and still finding answers to those questions. i keep a journal too.

Like others have said, from my own experience, I think professional help is the way forward. It's a massive step, and it takes a lot of courage to make that phone call. It's also expensive, but compared to gym memberships you don't use and all of that, it's not too bad.

I'm by no means cured, but I've now been to a few one-to-one sessions with a therapist, and I can already see some changes. 

Here is an idea of what we've covered; 

Triggers: There are lots of triggers people have for emotional eating, and like me you might have multiple triggers which in turn have specific cravings. As someone else said, mindfulness is going to be key - ""naming the emotion"", understanding why you think this specific food is going to satisfy you, and so forth. 

You'll also have to look into your past - did your parents reward you with food? Were you pressured into, or praised for, eating everything on your plate? Did you have siblings who eat all the cake if you didn't get in there first? Honestly, some of it is going to hurt, and it's hard to unlearn. 

On a positive note, as I said, I have noticed some changes over the last couple of weeks (after a lifetime of bad habits). Food doesn't 'talk' to me as much - or I can ignore it more successfully. I've said ""no"" to food and not sat regretting it. When I have been grazing it's been far smaller amounts.

Please hang in there :)

 I used to be stuck in a quasi recovery binge/purge cycle for a while. The key to breaking it is to eat what you want throughout the day. For example I used to binge on pancakes, but after eating them constantly (I usually ate them 6 times a day) for a while ur body gets used to it and just goes ""oh"" and u don't find it as tempting anymore. The key is to convince your body that it can have whatever it's craving without punishment or induced famine. Another tip: after the binge DONT PURGE! you'll feel awful I wont lie but in the long run it'll stop because your body realizes it can have food. Just distract yourself in the moment and push away the ED thoughts

You think you can continue the cycle, but the purging will eat away your throat, osteoporosis may begin to set in depending on the nutrients you allow your body to keep, and there are many other negative health factors that take a while to set in, but it's never to late to change!

",spiritkale,1554389845.0,2019-04-04 09:57:25,"Ive struggled with the same binge/starve cycle for years and years. The biggest help for me wasn't actually a therapist (although that was for sure helpful), but a nutritionist who specialized in ed recovery. She was straight to the point and used science and reasoning and a bit of tough love and that seemed to work more than simply talking things through. With the nutritionist we used an app called recovery record (which a clinician can be linked to so that they can see your logs, or you can download it and use it yourself). You log every meal/skipped meal/exercise/purge/etc. along with how you were feeling physically, mentally, emotionally at the time using a checklist. It helps daily to become aware of how youre feeling when participating in behaviors, why your doing it, what your patterns are (there are even charts for that), etc. It's honestly one of the most helpful tools ive ever had for recovery and i love using it when i find myself slipping back into old patterns.

When I was working with her, my goals (which were set on the app with reminders!), were to consume breakfast, a morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, and dinner, then an evening snack. it felt like a daunting task and like waaaaaay too much food initially. But then it become more normal, and I never actually gained weight like I was afraid of. I felt so much better, and eventually settled into a solid routine that worked for me of X meals and X snacks a day. 

Some random thoughts that sometimes help me:

\-When your binging after a period of starving, you're not necessarily eating ""too much"". you're making up for lack of calories and nutrition that you've been depriving your body.

\-Allow yourself to eat intuitively- if you're craving a cookie or a bag of chips, strawberries with chocolate, mashed potatos, etc whatever it is, during a starve cycle, simply allow yourself to eat that one craving. if you don't, you'll end up binging out on that and much more later, so why not just listen to your body and eat it right now?

\-If i find myself binging even though I wasn't ACTIVELY starving myself prior, Ill take a look back at what I was actually consuming, more than likely it was not enough 

\-Just because you don't want to eat, doesn't mean you don't have to eat. push through.

What finally helped me break free from my own eating disorder (similar to yours!) was to stop working out. It sounded crazy. I felt weird. But SO much time/mental space opens up once you realize you can live without planning your next workout/meals/binges/workouts to ""undo"" binges, showers, etc. I remember going home after work and being like, what the hell do I actually like to do anymore??!! Turns out, there's a lot of things that give me joy that aren't workout/binge centric, I just never had the time.

An anti-diet or HAES nutritionist is a great first step. Mine challenged me to stop running for a year and just see what happened. I regained my life.

It suppresses appetite for part of the day, but all that hunger built up causes me to eat a bunch more at night when it wears off.

It would be worthwhile to see a therapist for your bulimia/binging, traveling with an eating disorder is dangerous since you cannot get the care you need, I would advise you at least consider postponing or canceling this trip until you have gotten the treatment you need.",adleighrose,1554324913.0,2019-04-03 15:55:13,"I have been recovering from bulimia that actually partially formed from the ups and downs from being on Adderall for most of my life. Adderall really suppressed my hunger and made my night binging and purging ramp up. I switched to Vyvanse shortly after graduation from college and I have found that it has actually helped me with controlling and healing my disorder. Vyvanse in general for me has been less extreme than Adderall and I still have a normal level of hunger during the day which allows me to eat normal meals while still treating my ADHD. So vyvanse might be an option but I will say this, you cant depend on a medication to be a cure all for your disease, you need to talk to some one be it a therapist/family member/ friend etc, to deal with the underlying issues. Vvyanse may help you with the compulsions but it probably wouldnt (at least in my case didnt) help you with the obsessive thoughts and negative mindset toward food. I had and still have to work everyday on my mind set and relationship to food and I have been in recovery for 2 years now. I think trying to run out and seek out a prescription while leaving such little time for a doctor to work with you and check in on your dosage and reaction to the medication sounds like a bad plan. Maybe reschedule your trip to a time when you are more stable.  I wish you the best of luck, remember you are strong:)

A) Your body NEEDS a rest day
B) What I did that helped me was establish maybe 2 days where I was doing something else, another hobby, hanging out with friends, a LIGHT walk with my dog, doing some major meal prep or cleaning at my house, something that can totally distract me from going to the gym. I have about 4 gym days, 2 days in between there where I DO NOT go to the gym, and 1 rest day. If you must, you could maybe do 5 gym days and the 2 days you do other things are restful. For me my obsession with the gym is bc of my obsession with my body and if I focus my mind on something else spiritually filling that I love to do 2 days out of the week it really helps take my mind off my obsession.

",GeorgiaLavendula,1554005862.0,2019-03-30 23:17:42,"Hi, im a medical-esk student who just completed a semester long research project on a topic similar to this. I studied the link between eating disorders ED and autoimmune diseases AD, which is growing more and more evident to the point that many doctors will screen for an ED after a AD diagnosis. Basically, some AD’s cause a lack of dopamine which is released by dendritic cells in the immune system. Patients began searching for ways to achieve the “same” levels they had before. For example, Anorexia alters signals in the pleasure portions of the brain to recognize pain as pleasure, hence why people become addicted to restricting and the over production of dopamine. Bulimia has the same effect during a b/p cycle. Part of the development of an ED after an AD diagnosis is also the sudden life change and added stress. Its difficult to be told you have to change the way you live your life or you will get sick. It takes away control over your own life, and you can develop an ED in response. 

In terms of your question, your diagnosis indirectly caused a shift in dopamine levels. Exercise produce “pleasure” hormones like cray (runners high for example). If your brain was used to your activity level, the sudden change may have caused you to respond with an ED as a way to normalize your hormone production and take control of your life in a time when you had none.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is a hypothesis that there exists a subset of children with rapid onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or tic disorders and these symptoms are caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infections. The proposed link between infection and these disorders is that an initial autoimmune reaction to a GABHS infection produces antibodies that interfere with basal ganglia function, causing symptom exacerbations. It has been proposed that this autoimmune response can result in a broad range of neuropsychiatric symptoms.  PANDAS is a subset of the pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) hypothesis.The PANDAS hypothesis was based on observations in clinical case studies  at the US National Institutes of Health and in subsequent clinical trials where children appeared to have dramatic and sudden OCD exacerbations and tic disorders following infections.

Keep working with your counselor and ask for advice on how to deal with your mom invalidating your illness and making those comments. You should establish boundaries, like making sure your mother knows not to comment on what you are eating or how much you are eating or anything about diets or weight. If your mom continues to break these boundaries, then she is choosing not to respect you or aid in your recovery. If you are still a minor, then you will need to work with your therapist to build resiliency to her disrepecting/invalidating you since she is unwilling to stop. If you are an adult and you are no longer living in the house with her, then you need to prioritize your healing over your relationship with your mom.

I have been in treatment with people of many shapes and sizes, all suffering from eating disorders. 

I resisted treatment for a very long time (I was in treatment against my choice because I was a minor) because I believed I wasn’t ‘sick enough’. And as an adult I waited until I was what I deemed ‘sick enough’ to get help for my eating disorder, and I regret it so much. The effects on my health have been terrible and will likely be with me for the rest of my life. Waiting until I was so far gone has made things so much harder than they needed to be, if only I had sought help sooner. It’s not worth it. 

And to be fair, I don’t know you but since you have an eating disorder you probably don’t have an objective view on the actual state of your weight. It gets pretty warped. Also, you do not need to be underweight for it to start taking a pretty serious toll on your health. 

So again, regardless of your weight or current health, I have to ask you; is your eating disorder beginning to consume your life? Is it making you miserable?

Firstly I am so sorry your dealing with hearing this shit it would make me wanna put my head through a wall. 

As far as your boss not eating that unhealthy and will catch up to her in one way or another trust me on that (you can’t always see he affects off anorexia as they are internal and fuck up your system from the inside. I speak from experience as anorexia and bad eating habits really really fucked me royally). Also with this I would say she’s either lying to you or is so insecure and having her own body dysmorphia issues that she may just be out of control. 

Not eating is not exactly going to keep you smaller, it will starve your body and when you do eat that will turn into fat and store in you, so your better off just snacking healthy and the drinking copious amounts of water is rly good but don’t over-drink or you will throw off your electrolyte balance and then you will have next health issues. Also as you age and the more you stress your system and not feed it nutrition you may risk heart attacks and other shit like that (it happened to my exis anorexic mother she had athletic anorexia it was rly messed up) she almost collapsed at the dinner table, scary shit. 

Lastly if you are stressed about your bod just start doing an activity that you like that is active and mix in healthy eating (I mean homemade and not snacking on crap bec your absolutely right that will only make you gain weight or feel empty if it’s not actually properly feeding your body). I would just start researching  nutrition and learning about it bec it will help you feel good bec you will b filing  your body properly. 

Also I if you feel like your loosing your mind when you have not eaten for a long time it’s bec you are depriving your brain of nutrition and you may start to feel like your hearing shit as your brain will probably be responding slow. 

So don’t torture your self, get educated, not eating is not a sustainable way to live and will catch up trust me it always wins and you got this!! 

And if you would like some help, I just know from how I eat and it’s not to bad and it took me a while to get there but I did it 🙂🙂",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It you have supportive and informed people, that's great. Also support groups and therapy are great if they're a place where you're expected to think/talk/reflect/self report/muse, etc. I don't have a support group for E.D stuff but a support group I go to for something else checks on me about food/listens to me share about where I'm at with it.

Also, if you feel safe enough with her, talk to your partner. If she doesn’t struggle with food, she can be an amazing resource to reflect disordered behavior back to you. My partner (28M) really helps by talking about odd behaviors he notices for what they are rather than accepting a distorted behavior as just something I “do “

If you haven't already, go and see a dietitian. They can help you with a meal plan built around exchanges rather than calorie counting.",meandmycat1,1554987591.0,2019-04-11 07:59:51,I'd add getting a physical to rule out a thyroid condition or other physical health issue.,Hungrychick,1554994968.0,2019-04-11 10:02:48,"I second this. For me during my recovery, eating more fat actually kept me feeling full for longer.",aranide,1554996192.0,2019-04-11 10:23:12,"You know this is normal. You said it yourself, you have been on a restrictive diet. So now that you are eating more and healthier your body tries to ""absorb"" the more calories and nutriment possible in case you decide to restrain again. So your brain tells your stomach to make you believe you are hungry. And the more you think about it the more you feel hungry, its like telling you to not think about the pink elephant, of course you will automatically think about it.

 Now what can you do about this? You should consider consulting a Nutritionist, She will help you make a meal plan right for you, With things you can and like to eat, it the right amount. A dietetician is not certified in nutrition, but it still can help you if its the only option. If Its not an option, I suggest you eat snack between your meal. Its either you split your 3 big meal in 5/6 little meal, or You keep your 3 meal and eat smal snack between meals. The trick is to listen to your body but with moderation. When I buy my grocerie for the week/month I split my portion right away in ziploc bag and conteiner, So I dont need to think about eating to much and going over my carb count(im type 1 diabetic) I put sticker and right encouraging word on my ziploc bag because it help me stay in line with my objective, plus it make me happy. Also, avoid eating right before going to bed or during the night, this is the best time for your body to ""store"" what you ate. When you sleep your body dont digest because it spend his energy on repairing itself. So instead of burning the calories, it wil just store them into fat.",problematicbeing,1555001625.0,2019-04-11 11:53:45,"So a few things:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Your Pre-ED weight might have been fine for you a few years ago or whatever, but adult bodies change and grow and you body might no longer run most effectively at this weight, which you even admitted was at the low end of whats healthy. What I weighed at 18 would require horrible levels of restriction to maintain now at age 22. My BMI I maintain at has gone up, and thats normal and natural to happen with age, our bodies are dynamic things. i'm not sure how old you are, but there is no one weight your body will be happiest at for your whole life, it fluctuates and changes.
2. You need to respect your hunger and not label it negatively as binges because you are perpetuating your ED by giving light to these thoughts. Your body is hungry, you eat more, when you moralize that and add judgement, you are creating a mistrust with your hunger. It is simple, eat more if you are hungry and DONT JUDGE IT.  

3. You re using ED behaviors, stuffing yourself with veggies and chugging diet drinks to suppress your appetite will only worsen what you are experiencing, since neither of those will stave off the hunger that you are ignoring permanently and will only put you in a restrict/feast cycle. Just respect your hunger the first time around and eat to it. Your body is intelligent, it won't make you keep eating nonstop forever if you give it what it asks for.  


If you feel like you can't do any of these things, please seek help from a therapist/dietitian that can help you get back on track with your recovery instead of continuing down the road to relapse. The answer to your restrictive ED is NOT to restrict more, it never is. You are at a low bmi and dealing with restriction, your problem is most certainly not overeating or ""becoming fat"" your problem is restriction.",invisiblepourlesyeux,1555010142.0,2019-04-11 14:15:42,I really liked this article on extreme hunger: https://edinstitute.org/paper/2012/5/22/extreme-hunger-1-what-is-it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s exhausting keeping all of that pain inside, but you’ve already made a positive step by asking for help on here. As far as seeking help, I think you would greatly benefit from talking to a therapist, and the therapist doesn’t necessarily have to be eating disorder specific. They can help talk you through your negative thinking, and help you differentiate between rational and irrational thinking. That was the greatest benefit I’ve had from using a therapist. If you have insurance, you can literally call the number on the back of your card and ask for help finding a behavioral specialist, or psychologist (I’ve definitely cried while doing this because I was so desperate). If you don’t have insurance, a lot of offices have a sliding scale fee based on income, but it does take a bit of work calling around. Oh and a note, you’re therapy is confidential, unless you tell them you plan on hurting yourself or others, and by that I mean actively suicidal or homicidal, so please don’t be afraid to talk to them about your self mutilation. Be as honest as possible, because that form of unburdening will go a long way for your mental state.

576,bbk5p8,1redjen,1554894444.0,2019-04-10 06:07:24,Go to a doctor right away! You could be seriously damaging yourself!,kukukachooohoo,1554896053.0,2019-04-10 06:34:13,"I’m so sorry that you are struggling so much with all of this. It’s not a fun situation to be in. 


I’m not really sure what to tell you other than you should see a doctor ASAP to try to get this worked out. I can promise you that this is not something you want to continue to do. An eating disorder just slowly kills you, in all honesty. 


I’m 33... I’ve struggled with an eating disorder since I was 16/17, and even before then I had tried it here &amp; there. I’ve gone back and forth so many times... right now I’m probably the worst I’ve been and I just know that if I don’t get my shit together soon, my boys are going to grow up without their momma. Which kills me to say, but that’s just the harsh reality of the situation. I didn’t have people who cared so much about me that they noticed a change in my eating or behavior. I think my parents always thought “oh not our kid” or “not us.” 


My point of telling you all that is your boyfriend cares about you and doesn’t want to see you hurting. He loves you for you. You gaining weight obviously hasn’t bothered him. He probably hasn’t even noticed! It’s okay to work back to being healthy, but take the right steps to get there so that it stays with you. This isn’t the way to go about losing weight. Unless you want to lose your mind too? Not to mention that your kid deserves to have you around for a while. Don’t cut your life short just because you gained some weight. Talking to a doctor you could even workout a plan to follow. If you aren’t losing weight then maybe the doctor could run tests to make sure everything’s working the way it should. Lol. 

I hope this helps in some way. Best of luck to you. Hang in there. 

And remember... you’ve had a child. Your body isn’t meant to go back to exactly how it was. I know that’s a hard thing to accept, but you’re beautiful the way you are.

Every day wake up, look in the mirror, and find at least one thing to compliment yourself on or just one small positive affirmation about yourself. Every day. soon you will start believing the things you say..you will exude confidence... and then I bet you’ll start to see the changes you want.

I was the exact same! Overweight but started struggling with binge eating disorder before moving to anorexia then back to binge eating and now bulimia over the past 3 years. My first bit of advice would be going to your GP and talking about this. This is your first step at getting some help and realising that your behaviours are damaging not only mentally but also physically. 

Bulimia can lead to a range of health concerns and I have experienced them and it’s quite scary. My second bit of advice would be talking to your partner - he’s obviously worried about you considering he’s watching and questioning you. You need to be open with him, relationships are based on communication and getting through the hard times together.

My third bit of advice after you have completed the first two steps. Help - therapy! Do it for you, your daughter and your partner. Think of the quality of life you’ll be living if you break free from this disorder! 

I know you can do it. All the best xx",[deleted],1554933644.0,2019-04-10 17:00:44,[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But one thing I would advice you to do is not mention her body or weight at all. No even in a positive way because it is a trigger even if you hear that your body is pretty. 

I would also advise you to just not give in to her and sit down and talk to her when she is actually in a state of clear thinking. Ask what you could do to help her and why she doesn’t want help.

Also, she has taken to begging me to insult her so she feels driven to restrict. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's not only dangerous to her, but to you. We already know it's wearing on you because you posted here.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A usual evening activity has become her begging me to call her ugly/fat and getting angry and dismissive when I refuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's a mindfuck. As with many people with ED she is dealing with comorbity. She has body dysmorphia and probably other issues that aren't being addressed. I can't say without knowing her, but it sounds like she could be a Borderline Personality; ED and BPD are kissing cousins. And the peril in that for you is, BPDs are manipulative, which is exactly what she's doing to you. Even if there is no BPD, she's manipulating you. Not cool, not good.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;She accuses me of trying to sabotage her. I'm feeling very overwhelmed and depressed by all of this, and really need some help.

&amp;#x200B;

You need to take a break until she gets help. You cannot help her, and like all people with mental illness, if she is unwilling to seek treatment, there is nothing you can do. If she refuses to help herself, the best you can do is step back and preserve yourself.",alimillls,1554909458.0,2019-04-10 10:17:38,"If you dont feel comfortable about telling her she‘s relapsing or she is getting mad when you tell her, try not to mention it at all. When I started to relapse my boyfriend at the time knew if he talked about it, it would make it worse. So he used the times when he was hungry to get some food for both of us, something like burgers for him and a safe food for me or something light like a salad. He then sat with me and ate and talked with me, like he would not notice me not eating something. Because he talked so much and also ate very slowly, over time I started eating slowly and if he needed to he sat there for hours talking to me until i finished my food. I didnt realize at the time but he really helped me, because he brought me to eat even if I felt like I could‘nt or i didn’t want to. 
Because of him talking and me being distracted i didnt think as much about it and if I‘m struggling nowadays I always try to eat with someone who knows I am struggling and it helps me very much. 
Telling me to eat something or saying my eating behaviors are unhealthy only make me eat less because i get very stubborn. So if talking with her doesn‘t seem like the right thing to do just try to give her food without telling her to eat her. Also works very good with fries or something else which she can eat in a few bits. If you also eat from the fries plate and talk enough she wont notice how much she is eating and how mich you are. But beware because this only works while relapsing because when she fall s deeper in her ED she‘ll realize it. (Still helped me tho but thats because he acted like he didnt see me eating which made me feel like i can eat).

Definitely protect yourself, but if you think that breaking up with her means she will snap out of it, you could be very wrong. I am very glad that it worked for some in this thread, but there are ED sufferers out there that could see it as a triggering event and a reason to completely return to ED behavior. If you do feel like you have to separate and break up with her, let her know it is because of the ED behaviors, and not because of her. Something along the lines of “You can’t be in a relationship with someone, who is in a relationship with their eating disorder.” Breaking Up With ED is a great book to reference for this. Then try telling someone else the mindset that she is in so they can look out for her. Someone like a close friend who knows about her ED, maybe a parent or sibling. 

Try reminding her of some of her favorite foods too, or things that she used to enjoy when she was a kid, something that brings up good memories. I know that was something that I would do when recovering. If you spend a lot of time together, try journaling or talking about things that make you happy. There was a time that I was really struggling and thinking about going back to my ED behaviors. At that time I bought a ton of self help books and “lists for happiness” all that junk.

Her parents should know. Anorexia is serious, and has a way of escalating. NOT bringing this health concern up to her parents is a betrayal--not the other way around.

He already indicated that the doctor wants her inpatient,  how many doctors do you need her to consult? In the US, often doctors will not put people in inpatient, or yank them before they're better, because of money. If she said she wants her inpatient, then it's not a good prognosis.

Do you have access to a doctor right now?,problematicbeing,1554839541.0,2019-04-09 14:52:21,"You will need to work with a eating disorder therapist on this. They will help you with the distortions you have around foods.  


We are quick to blame diet for health problems in our society. I have IBS and people always want to immediately tell me to try this diet, or removing this food, and I have tried those things and they don't work. What I eat has almost no effect on my IBS issues. IMO, any health issue should be tested and treated in every other way before suggesting a dietary change, especially for people with history of ED's.   


A therapist will probably tell you to stop looking things up about food. Working on stopping yourself from reading about these things will prevent another source of fear. They will also help you reduce your stress/anxiety(stress an anxiety can cause health conditions, and might be contributing to your skin issues more than any food possibly could).

When I would have particularly bad breakouts/ED flareups, and I started falling off the deep end, I would repeat reassuring phrases to myself. My favorite is ""Eating anything is healthier than dying,"" i.e., even if a food in ""unsafe"" or unhealthy it's better to eat it than let myself starve.

Then sometimes I work up the courage to eat my favorite, easiest meal at this fast casual restaurant that I like. It's something that I liked a lot that broke every single one of my self imposed rules. Just to remind myself that I could. Just to see that it wouldn't be the end of the world. I hoped doing so would kick me out of the negative feedback loop of avoiding food. It's a bit scary at first, and then it feels freeing.

I also count my calories to make sure I eat enough each day. I find that helps me stay a bit more sane.

You can have disordered eating habits without having a full on eating disorder, but your thyroid issues really might be a main and only cause.

You say you're ""very slightly"" over normal weight for your height. If you are still feeling this badly about your body, you are not recovered, not mentally anyway. You recognize that you still have a lot of disordered thinking.

Trying to lose weight is likely to be much riskier than just trying to let go of control. It's not as scary to your disordered brain, but way more likely to lead to serious physical and mental health consequences. The only way to get better is to stop trying to control your body, especially since you're not at an unhealthy weight. That doesn't mean you have to love and accept it yet, but give yourself more time. And go to a thrift store and find some clothes that actually fit you. It's much easier to be okay with your body when you're not trying to force yourself into clothes that are too small.

I know you want to be happy and healthy in your body, but trying to diet again is not going to make that happen. If you're suffering this much from your current body shape, losing weight is not going to fix that, because the problem is not your body, it's that you're still sick. And as long as you're sick, even if you lose weight, you're probably not going to reach a point at which you're happy with your body. You'll keep wanting to lose.

For the record, I've struggled with a lot of the same things as you. A lot of my identity was tied up in being the fit one and having a certain body type. I tried to control my body for years when I was supposed to be recovering, and it never helped. I still struggle sometimes, but I'm doing much better, and in the past 1-2 years, I've actually lost a bit of weight without trying to. It's possible that your weight in recovery will not be your weight forever, and that it will slowly go down a bit on its own without you forcing it.",SailorRose23,1556160123.0,2019-04-24 21:42:03,"Blah I’m gonna just go ahead not be anonymous so I can correct some things within my original post.

If I feel motivated to do more that’s great, but I’ve noticed if I make this goal of 3 classes my mental health is so much better which leads to better food choices and body image.

My body can’t do the amazing things it used to. It doesn’t look perfect anymore. And that’s hard to deal with. But reminding myself that my body is still a part of me that is capable of helping me do yoga and carrying me through life really helps. It’s not as remarkable, but it has helped a lot. 

It also just took a lot of time to become comfortable with how I look now. I weight about 10-15 lbs more than I did at my low weight and have very little visible muscle tone. I went through a period where I weighed about 25-30 lbs more right after I quit dance. I lost the weight by eating a reasonable deficit for my height 5 days a week and enjoying whatever I was craving on the weekend, and excersizing 3 times a week. The weight loss was slow (prepbably 5-6 months) which was hard but definitely worked for me and didn’t throw me into restrictive mode. 

It’s been about 3 years since I quit and while I still have a lot of frustration when my body can’t do something it used to, or clothes don’t fit right, things are a lot better. I actually feel more confident with some extra weight. I’ve showed myself that people still like me and I’m still capable even if I don’t have the “perfect” body. I actually have more friends now and get more attention from guys. I used to think I was only “worthy” if I didn’t eat.

I don't think it was really responsible for your doctor to hassle you about your weight given your history of ED.

I know you want to be able to feel okay when you look at yourself in the mirror, but that isn't going to come with weight loss. I mean, when you were sick, did you feel like any amount of weight loss was ""enough"" or made you okay with your body? I don't know about you, but I didn't. At my lowest weight, I hated my body more than I ever had, because all I could see about it were the things I still wanted to change. Your future is not ruined because you're a bit overweight. It could be ruined if you get really sick again. I'm not saying you can never diet again if that's what you want to do, but maybe you should at least work more on your recovery first. Even if you decide you want or need to lose weight, there's no reason you have to do it right now, as opposed to waiting a year until you're more recovered. This isn't as urgent as your ED tells you it is.",naytertotsandwich,1556198742.0,2019-04-25 08:25:42,"Hey there! I'm 26 and have been recovered for many years now. Now, dont get me wrong, I still get some ED thoughts and still have pitfalls, however, I'm able to conquer those with full force at this point. I struggled with AN at age 15. That slowly turned into BED, as I was still using food as a coping mechanism. I ended up gaining a ton of weight and wasn't feeling my best at all. I began focusing on my health at about age 20. The best advice I can give you is this. First, accept your body right now as it is. Your body is amazing! It takes you from A to B. It houses a brilliant mind with it's own unique personality! That's awesome! Second, start moving for fun and health. I started walking a lot. No pressure, just enjoy the weather, clear your mind, and be happy knowing that walking is still low impact, low stress cardiovascular activity. When you do this try to think about how good this is for your heart, your lungs, your mind. When you get into a regular routine and maybe feel ready, maybe try different activities that you enjoy. Do you like running? Dancing? Yoga? My one rule I have? I will not force myself to exercise if I feel I NEED to. For example, if I feel I ate too much and need to exercise? I wont because if that's the sole reason, it's not the right reason. That could spiral in a bad direction and make me feel worse. However, I will exercise if I'm feeling good and motivated! The ultimate goal is to enjoy exercise, moving and being active. An active lifestyle should never be a punishment or a chore. Otherwise, you'll get burned out. Trust me I've been there. Thirdly, start eating mindfully. For example, I started choosing good foods for my meals that I also very much enjoyed. I made my meals mindfully, I ate slowly and savored the taste, and when I was finished I felt good. I would recommend not counting calories and not weighing yourself. Try to begin eating intuitively, exercising intuitively, and focusing on how your body and mind feel. This will help you to begin a positive relationship with your body, not the scale, and not the calories. Fourth, try to prioritize rest. Rest does a body wonders, and you'll need plenty of rest to help with your mental and physical state. Rest if you need to! Dont be too hard on yourself. Fifth? Take. It. Slow. Please remember that Rome wasn't built in a day and this process takes time. I would've never known at age 20 that it would take many years to finally be where I am at now. I went from focusing on my health casually, and still sometimes struggling, to being what I would consider an athlete at age 26, almost 27. But you know what? I dont regret it one bit! I'm so happy that I took my time and slowly began getting healthier both mentally and physically. Remember, this process is about the health of your body and mind. The physical changes are a nice perk, but that cannot be the sole purpose, especially as someone with an eating disorder history.

Find the caloric intake you need to lose 1lb/wk and stick to it.

Include dairy/dairy replacement on the side for calcium/vitamins A and D. Make sure to leave room for a small treat like a pudding cup every single day so that you don't become too obsessed with only eating ""good"" foods.

I was in denial about it for about six years before copping to it *just enough* to let my SO take me to treatment. I think the denial is normal, and the fact that you're aware you're denying it and talking about it is amazing and brave! That's a really hard thing to do, especially because so many of us are perfectionists. It's hard to admit things have gone wonky, but even harder to admit we've been lying to ourselves and others about it.

You're right though, you do need to see someone. It seems like you're in the perfect headspace to begin some kind of treatment for this, and I sincerely hope you do. Eating disorders are often difficult to overcome alone without professional intervention because food is unavoidable in a way that other abused ""substances"" aren't. Going to a treatment center or seeing a new therapist/dietician team is scary, yes, but it can also be validating and healing when you give yourself over to the process.

My biggest DIY help for being triggered is grounding exercises. You can Google that and find huge lists of tips and routines that may help. Grounding is basically a way to tether yourself to reality and what's actually happening in front of you when ED thoughts have you in a stranglehold and you're thinking about making a decision based on something irrational or are on the brink of a panic attack. It's super helpful!!! Some people keep grounding kits with them. My friend made one that has super minty gum, her favorite lotion, these weird glitter stick things from Amazon, Play-Doh, and a stress ball.

But it does appear that you have disordered eating and it's a good thing you are aware of it right now because you have the ability to prevent it from sprialling. 
A few things: when you exercise you need to eat MORE, not less than what you were eating before exercising. If you already don't eat enough, exercising will put you into a deficit of calories and you are at a higher risk of dehydration. This isn't safe and you should not be exercising if you aren't eating enough. 
Also, it makes sense that you feel like you cant eat more. When you decrease your intake over time, you body gets accustomed to that level of intake and you'll feel full after eating less food. But just because you are full does not mean that you ate enough. Disorder eating screws up your hunger and fullness cues and you shouldn't trust them. You may not feel like you want to eat more, but you need to. Your body needs the food in order to function properly. Especially dealing with depression and anxiety, malnutrition will only worsen those symptoms. 
Two meals a day is not enough. A protein bar is not food. Especially if you're exercising. 
Most importantly - BMI is complete bullshit. It does not measure whether or not you're healthy. 
People with eating disorders do eat, people with eating disorders have normal BMIs. Eating disorders are a mental illness. 
If you're worried that you're developing an eating disorder, please talk to your therapist. It's very common for eating disorders to go hand in hand with depression and anxiety. And talk to him/her about your body image as well. See if your therapist can refer you to a nutritionist where they can come up with a meal plan that will satisfy your nutritional needs. 
Weight loss due to calorie restriction is not healthy weight loss. Also, the people around you are more likely to notice when something is wrong before you do. Trust your boyfriend when he says something's wrong, he cares about you and wants the best for you and clearly sounds worried. 

TL,DR: if you're worried, talk to someone about it. Don't brush these things off. Think about it: if you noticed someone you cared about doing the same things you are, would you brush it off?

People with eating disorders have disordered eating patterns, but not all people with disordered eating patterns have an eating disorder. For example, when considering EDNOS vs disordered eating there is a strong psychological component to ednos as a diagnostic category (obsession, compulsion, fear, guilt etc around food, exercising, purging) that makes it distinct from disordered eating patterns. This is not to say, however, that therefore disordered eating patterns might not be serious. 

That said, when you think outside of black and white definitions (e.g. diagnostic criteria) there's a shit load of grey area and it's good to ask these questions because it's important to be critical of how we define what is an ED, per diagnostic criteria, and what isn't. I was listening to a podcast the other week about EDs and apparently until somewhat recently males couldn't technically be anorexic because one of the diagnostic criteria was loss of period.

Statistically speaking, it's far easier to stop an eating disorder from fully developing than it is to recover from an eating disorder; early identification is key.

I liken it to lung illnesses: you may have to have a specific bacterial infection to a specific level in order to be diagnosed with pneumonia (a potentially-fatal illness usually requiring intense antibiotics or antivirals and sometimes hospitalization), but the fact there's strict diagnostic criteria with pneumonia doesn't mean you should ignore a cough that won't go away just because it isn't *yet* pneumonia.

If you attempt to restrict any possible weight gain, you are essentially still holding hands with your disorder.  


Obviously, you have spend 5ish years suffering from an eating disorder that told you gaining weight is the end of the world and that being in a larger body is a horrible thing, so it will take time and treatment to get out of the mindset. You should definitely tell your therapist about your eating issues, especially if you see the therapist your friend recommended. A therapist will help you cope with the changes, both physically and mentally that come with recovering from your eating disorder once and for all.  


Transitioning from high school to college is difficult, even without an ED. You will need the extra support and to go into it with a plan on how to manage eating, so that you don't use it as an excuse to restrict, since no family will be around and you will be in charge of your own eating.

It's about learning to cope with something and recognizing to get professional help when needed. 

Dieting can often be extreme or obsessive, especially if you have an addictive personality or difficult/new situation in life, stress etc - it doesn't mean you have an eating disorder. But, losing weight should never make you feel scared or that you might lose control, rather something healthy and positive (if you'd be overweight or wanted to be more fit to begin with).

Eating disorders are not only about losing weight and control with diet or exercise - they are different for everyone but have some specific symptoms that might be very long-term. Often ED patients live in complete denial of even having any problems with eating and their whole lives and health are consumed by the disorder.

It took me FOREVER to find a good therapist, and dietician actually. I had one great one who burned me badly, but she was probably the biggest help w ED. The one I’m seeing now is an ED specialist as well, but we kind of dance around it because I have so many other things going on in life.

He isn’t a specialist, and sounds like he’s downplaying a serious issue in your life. I suggest, immediately terminating the relationship so it doesn’t damage your mental health further. Getting help for this is very hard, and it’s like a slap in the face when you feel like you’re not being taken seriously. I think it’s also alarming he doesn’t even have time to see you again for another month. I don’t even know if it’s worth asking him if he has anyone he could refer you to who specializes because it sounds like he just doesn’t get it.

Second one was clearly still anorexic, specialized in eating disorders, helped a ton, felt like I was heard and listened to etc. Third one.....meh, she made one off-comment and I was over it. 

The point is- DROP HIM. If he sucks, he sucks. Some mechanics are bad, some waitresses are bad, some painters are bad. So some therapists are bad too. 

I once had a doctor laugh at me when I admitted I have bulimia/anorexia. (I suppose her laugh was an implication that you couldnt have both?) Her laugh made me wait an additional 7 years to ever seek professional help. I realize now......that she simply sucked ass. Some doctors are bad too. 

Please, please try again. ALWAYS get someone who specializes in eating disorders/anxiety.

As far as the facility goes, everything is bright and clean and cozy, and it lines up with what you see on their site. I spent my first few nights in a big room with other new girls and then moved upstairs to a smaller bedroom with its own bathroom and a roommate. I think there were about 10-15 women and girls in the house at a time, with people coming and going, stepping down to IOP, day programs, etc.

I think you would be a good fit. I fit into about half the categories you mentioned, but I had treatment buds who more closely aligned with your situation, and they were able to do the work they needed to do and got the help they deserved. I was a PTSD/AN dual-diagnosis patient, and they did so much to help me work through my trauma as a means of helping me understand and get away from the ED.

Like you've heard, it's IFS heavy. Like, there's SO MUCH IFS. The director even brought in a specialist one time to run groups for a week. It's not really my jam, but it was helpful to me in certain ways. My individual therapist wasn't big on it, so we focused more on EMDR, art, and creative writing in our sessions. She also facilitated family sessions with my parents and husband (I'm local-ish, so it was an option for me). The groups were typically pretty focused, but I felt like sometimes they got away from certain therapists. 

We had a yoga teacher come to the house a few times a week for movement and meditation sessions, and there's also a FANTASTIC nurse/artist/yogi who works with the outpatient people. They do a good job of keeping you on a diverse and interesting schedule. There were optional weekly outings, which were hit or miss, but still fun.

The food part was also solid. FH is the only place I've ever gone for treatment, so I can only repeat what I've heard, but FH isn't as militant about dining rules as other places.

HOWEVER, for this kind of exploration, i’d really advise having a trip sitter, like somebody sober to be there as well, somebody who knows about your eating disorder so you can talk to them about it. it’s easy to get into that negative headspace and make your trip turn into a bad trip - for example, i had like a “scary” sounding song on in the background and it full on made me so terrified that i just laid there feeling like i was going to die - without my trip sitter to say “hey, just change it to a different song” i’d be a much worse experience. with something like a mental health problem, maybe it’d be worth it to have someone to guide you through rough patches if they come. 

apart from that, just make some art, listen to some music, go outside and lay in the grass, think about god. draw the music (i got some pretty cool synesthesia), dance, take photos of the flowers and the worms in your garden. watch a cool looking movie when you start coming down (i recommend futurama). it’s a fun experience and can be really insightful, don’t go in with too many expectations and force yourself to think about your ED all the time. just let it come naturally, and if it doesn’t cure it, then thats okay too.",thejollygiraffe,1556796036.0,2019-05-02 06:20:36,"I haven’t used psychedelics to help with my ED specially, but I have taken quite a bit of psychedelics just for fun over the years and I think it could help with recovery. Tripping expands your awareness and can allow for a level of introspectiveness unfounded in everyday life (for most people). If you choose to use your time tripping to process and work through the thoughts, feelings, and impulses related to your ED, sure I think it could help. 

That said, please (please please) if you are going to trip on LSD, do yourself a favor and buy a reagent testing kit. Unfortunately, over the last several years thousands of research chemical created in labs (usually in China) are being sold as LSD because they produce effects that “mimic” LSD. The experience is not the same, and the effects are completely unknown as these chemicals are so new that it’s impossible to know long term side effects. Even if you think you have a reliable source....don’t. You can never be too safe, and there are way more RCs out there than there is real LSD. Do not just take someone’s word for it. You can avoid this entirely by eating raw mushrooms, hence avoiding the possibility of RCs. However, if someone offers you a psilocybin chocolate, gummy, or other baked good though, that is probably also an RC (and not a fun one) so I would be careful with that as well.

After the trip the feeling didn't last and I still have disordered thoughts but it was nice to know that it is possible to get out of the mindset through psychedelics.

On another note, the ""body high"" that comes with taking 2c-b can make my dysphoria go away on a trip and make me feel comfortable in my body in a way I'd previously only been able to achieve while sick or starving. HOWEVER it can go one of two ways as it did make me hyper aware of my body as well, which fed into discomfort and disordered thinking as well at certain points. 

As a whole, I feel like psychedelics have amplified my current attitude towards myself and my ED where I'm ambivalent and not committing fully to recovery or relapse- so in a way taking them helps me have that dialogue with myself and explore my feelings about my current behaviours and about recovery.",invisiblepourlesyeux,1556826605.0,2019-05-02 14:50:05,"Tripping on DMT really helped me with my ED but set &amp; setting matter.

The first time I ever smoked DMT actually was one of the first things that made me realize my ED was a problem - because it was ALL about food and made me realize how obsessed I was and how much of my life it had taken over. 

While I am pro psychedelics in general do keep in mind that they can trigger certain types of mental illness if you are predisposed, so if you have any family history of schizophrenia or psychosis it may not be a helpful thing for you to try.

it isn't healthy mentally and at some point, if you wanted to achieve full recovery from your eating disorder, you would need to let it go. Although it would have been better if you had a therapist who helped you ""ween"" off of using it, this circumstance provides the opportunity to challenge the belief that you must be burning xxx calories a day to need to eat.  


1. Every human in this planet needs to eat, no exceptions. They don't need to earn the right to eat, it is something every person deserves and needs to do. 
2. Your job isn't changing, you are still doing the same things that still need the same amount of fuel/food. Even if you got a job tomorrow that required you work 8 hour days at a desk, you would still need plenty of food. Again eating isn't a privilege earned by burning so much energy in a day, its a fundamental need  
3. The numbers don't matter. BMI/Calories/TDEE/weight whatever. When it comes down to it, what matters is your relationship with your food/body. Is the fear of weight gain causing distress in your life? Is eating still something that is surrounded with anxiety? If so, you should work on those things with a therapist/dietitian and try to heal yourself. No one should have to live their whole life with an ED or in quasi-recovery. Everyone deserves full recovery where they heal their relationship with food and their body.   


This is going to be a hard transition but it is also a door into the next step in your recovery. By relying heavily on justifying your eating through your fitbbit, you haven't allowed yourself to have unconditional permission to eat when you want/need. Giving yourself these permissions are hard, but with the help of a therapist who specializes in ED's it should be very possible with time and work. Best of luck in your recovery! You are capable of doing this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many things we don’t want to do, such as an assignment for school, we tend to create excuses or obstacles to present why we won’t do the assignment. We say “I have to do A, but I want to do B.” In your case, “I have to eat healthier, but I want to avoid eating.” The key word is “but” in these sentences. 

Now, instead of saying “but”, say “and.” In other words, “I have to do A, and I want to do B.” The reason why this matters is because you are separating what is the right thing to do versus what you want to do. In the first example, you’re just trying to justify why you won’t do the right thing. But in the second, you are saying what you should do and what you want to do. Your not discarding what you have to do.

I’m 28(F), and was first diagnosed with an ED when I was 14 and have unfortunately relapsed a few times since. 


I went through inpatient treatment when I was 14 and I will never forget something one of the counselors said in my very first group therapy session...I don’t remember her exact words but she essentially said something along the lines of “your ED will be a semi-constant fixture in your life, for the rest of your life. Rearing it’s head when you least suspect it or feel that you’ve fully recovered. So prepare yourself” I spent years wallowing in this idea- that I would never be normal, never have a normal relationship with eating, etc. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized it’s not so black and white. Just having an awareness (as you do!) of when you start to feel off, or feel your relationship with food shifting into unhealthy territory, is the first step to avoiding relapse. So I think you being cognizant of how you are feeling is a great step. As for how to not want to relapse...I wish I had the answer to that. I still find myself drifting into unhealthy thought patterns sometimes and when that spiral starts and it can be difficult to stop. So I guess I don’t really have any “advice” for you other than you’re not alone, talk to a therapist if you can, and I’m sending lots of positive healing vibes your direction 💕 here for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

629,bj1e4j,problematicbeing,1556632737.0,2019-04-30 08:58:57,"I've found set point to be very true for myself. Every time I've recovered(4 times now lol but this time it is solid), I've ended up within a +/- 10lb weight range where my body runs most comfortably. This weight range has scooted a bit up since I was 18(I am 23 now), but that makes sense. Your body changes as  you get older and the weight you were when you were a teen is not going to be the same as in your 20s, 30s, 40s, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently at the highest weight of my life and if someone had told me this is what I would gain to when I was in my last relapse, I would have broke down crying and refused to recover. But now, I am extremely at peace with my weight, not because it is my idea of perfect, but because I choose to accept my body however it wants to be without changing it. It took time to get here, but the key was acceptance and kindness. I am not allowed to be mean to myself. I can't insult my body, even in my mind. I also chose to celebrate weight gain rather than resent it.

  


A goal in recovery should be to make peace with your body at whatever weight it feels comfortable at. You don't have to love your body and feel ultra confident but you do have to accept it as it is. Making peace with your body has to be unconditional. Your eating disorder tells you that your are only allowed to like your body on some condition, like it's below xxx lbs or your stomach looks like a models. Since the acceptance is conditional, the conditions can change. Maybe you hit xxxlbs and you still don't love your body and your ED says ""well now we have to lose more weight and work out to like our body"". And you do that, and it changes again. Chasing self acceptance but only getting self destruction.

&amp;#x200B;

Unconditionally accepting your body means even if you are massively bloated from your period, you are still kind to your body and self. The number on the scale can't influence your self worth. It gives you the ability to accept yourself that your eating disorder promised, but without any strings attached or negative consequences.",backbird05,1556940573.0,2019-05-03 22:29:33,"I am convinced about set points after my experience. I was a bigger kid most of my life and then was obese before having a restrictive eating disorder and nose diving to being under weight. In the initial stages of my recovery I was at a ""healthy"" weight. No one was worried. My weight was stable. No medical complications, having a period, etc. 
But then I COULD NOT get pregnant. My husband and I tried for two years and had fertility treatments to try to help. We did end up getting pregnant on our own but it was painstaking. 
I gained weight and a new level in my recovery with the pregnancy and birth of my daughter. My amazing body created a human and served me in ways that I'd never imagined. AND I was craving foods and eating in different ways. 
I then maintained my post pregnancy weight, a bit higher. 
We we're worried about how long it would take us to have a second child so we started trying sooner than we really wanted a second kid. And go figure I got pregnant in literally one month. We lost that baby during pregnancy and then we're able to conecieve again, a year or two later, in a couple of months. .my second pregnancy was much smoother with fewer complications and that baby did much better health-wise. (first had a growth restriction and all kinds of problems just after birth). 
I don't know how much is related to my weight. Bit I know there was a big difference in my experience and I believe that some of it is related to weight even though I don't have hard evidence to support that. 
And for what it's worth, same thing happened to my sister but Kore extreme.  She was under her set point , infertility for 5 years finally ivf worked. And then she gained weight to be more healthy and then she accidentally got pregnant.

Part of going through ED therapy is to remove shame from food in general and learn how to listen to your body when it tells you its hungry and what it’s hungry for. Years of certain thought and behavior patterns will lead your brain to tell you you canNOT have that slice of pizza. But your body says, “hey, I’m low on salt, carbs, and fat right now, so pizza sounds better than an apple which will really only give me the carbs.” 

Everything in moderation really is a good guiding principle. People who don’t suffer from disordered eating are able to go out for drinks and have a burger, and still be able to run 5 miles easily. I used to look at these people in awe. But now I realize they’re just doing what I never could, which is listen to their bodies and indulge sometimes but not all the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defensiveness is a natural reaction when a person is already struggling, and they don't even know that they have an ED. She is just as shocked and unaware- IMO - as I believe you guys are.  

She will never ""want"" to get help; if she has anorexia/pure restrictive type, then by definition, the illness hinges on NOT wanting to gain weight, and it also is impossible to see the reality of one's actual physical state. Refusing the food she once embraced, esp. something as overall harmless as chex mix, is a big sign also.

What can you personally do?  Be her friend, listen to her, and try to really hear what she is saying if she ever opens up. There's something in her life that is causing her to feel out of control or totally chaotic, and this ED is a way of trying to gain some semblance of control.

It didn't take long before a genuine shift occurred where I had thoughts like ""I need to take care of my body, or I can't run that race. Second helping of dinner, please!"" It also helped to experience for the first time in my LIFE my body being a tool for my own purposes, to help me achieve something I set my mind to - instead of the number on the scale, my pants size, or an object of sexual desire. 

I'm not saying you can't ever ""exercise"" again or that it doesn't have health benefits. I just know that I had to really embrace a completely different mental paradigm around the whole topic. ""Exercise"" = punishment for me. If it even comes close to meaning the same thing for you, I encourage you to break up with that word and concept forever.

Your story tells me that you are indeed struggling with an ED and possibly metabolic issues that are tied to something we cannot easily see, like thyroid or other internal issues.

Any person trained in the psych. field within recent history should know that EDs are no longer diagnosed by a weight criteria, not even anorexia, which was once requisite of several underweight conditions. Now - the DSM has removed those, so it is absolutely a diagnosable condition regardless of weight or missed menstrual cycles.

Even so, an ED does not require low weight whatsoever.

EDs are mental, not physical, illnesses. They  manifest physically, but the illness is mental. The best psych in your area is where you could start, unless you do have an ED unit or hospital with one nearby. Don't go back to the dr/psych you are seeing, because they are not up to date and worse, they aren't validating your own gut instinct.

I definitely went through a similar phase of struggling to keep down more than ~500 calories a day after my body got used to it, and a few things helped me up my intake. First, meal shakes. You got the ensures, and that’s awesome, but I’d recommend trying a variety so you don’t get sick of it. Drinking lots of water helps, too- it helps with the constipation and also helps adjust tour body to having something in it at all times. From there, I stepped up to smoothies, and then real food was much easier. I was eating real food when I drank the shakes, but not much. 

Two more things I want to say- if you’re not eating at maintenance every day, you will keep losing weight. I know it can seem discouraging, but it’s helpful for understanding your body. Also, look up the way that bodies gain weight after anorexia. It takes almost a year for it to even out entirely, and six months for it to not just be around the torso. Your body is gaining there to protect your organs, although you’re likely just experiencing bloat/having food in your body.

The last time I went I was at the lowest weight of my adult life (technically still within a ""normal"" range but way too low for me and my build), and they almost sent me to the hospital before letting me into the treatment center (residential non medical setting) because they were afraid I was gonna have heart failure. But I met some of the most amazing people and the staff were incredible. It was intense and hard but worth it. Depending where u go the routines vary. In a hospital inpatient center it's mostly just stabilizing your food along with group therapy and weekly individual therapy. If ur going to a non medical center, theres more focus on therapy and getting to the reasons behind the disorder and dealing with those. You will have a team of therapist, psychiatrist,  and nutritionist. Most places weigh you and take vitals either daily, weekly, or a couple times a week (my last tx center it was mon, wed, fri unless they were monitoring u more closely for health reasons).

You could read the book(3rd edition) or do the workbook or see a dietitian who specializes in intuitive eating. The goal of intuitive eating is to make peace with food and eating, and to do so in way that is pleasurable and satisfying.   


There is a lot of misinformation about food addiction everywhere, but especially on the internet. This isn't a label you should put on yourself based on what you have read. Almost none of it accounts for restriction or moralizing food or internalized weight stigma.   


Intuitive eating neutralizes the way you look at food, there are no good/bad choices. You are intended to get in touch with yourself and better understand your hunger/fullness and what feels good and what doesn't but in a non-judgemental way. The judgements we put on ourselves because of what we eat, often drive us to make choices about food that cause us physical and emotional pain.   


Demonizing your emotional eating as food addiction is more likely to cause it to worsen than it is to relieve you of it.

I say that because making yourself sick after ""unhealthy"" meals indicates a level of disorder eating - also the fact that you feel guilty for eating said meals. It could be beneficial for you to talk with a professional about these feelings you have regarding your body image and food. Nobody should ever feel like they need to make themselves sick. 

That being said, making yourself sick is extremely dangerous whether you do it every day or every month. It damages your esophagus and you can risk rupturing it. It damages your teeth - risking cavities and tooth decay. It messes with your electrolytes which affects your heart. You need to get some kind of help for this because continuing this habit can kill you.

It doesn’t sound like an eating disorder (I’m no expert but from my knowledge of eating disorders, this isn’t one). You just need a different, healthier outlet for your stress. Exercise or drawing has helped people. Engaging in an activity that you enjoy or find comforting is also helpful.",Toast_in_the_Toaster,1557970984.0,2019-05-15 20:43:04,"Under-eating and over-eating are both pretty common ways that stress affects people.

Perhaps look into therapy, it can be a great resource to learn how to cope with the stress in a healthy way and I know some colleges offer counseling.
 
Also, keep in mind that even if you do feel sick isn't a good excuse to not eat. I know it's hard (as someone who tends to not eat under stress) but you gotta force yourself to, your body needs it.

660,boguxo,RosieRose456,1557830900.0,2019-05-14 05:48:20,"Hi! It's already a big step into the right direction that you plan to go to a therapist! I started recovery one and a half months ago(haven't binged or purged since then) after I struggled with bulimia and anorexia for two years. Eventhough I know that everyone is different I really hope that my tips can help you.

1. Get rid if your scale or get someone to hide it from you. One thing that always caused me to relapse was my ""weight gain"". In the beginning you'll feel bloated and hold onto a lot of water but that's normal trust me.

2. Don't restrict. I've always restricted and ended up binging and then purging. I've found out that eating every 3 hours really helps with preventing binges. So try to eat three meals and 2 snacks! 
Also don't just eat healthy try to eat one piece of chocolate every day so that you don't risk binging when you only eat ""healthy"" food. But if you feel like eating ""unhealthy"" food triggers binges then take small steps and eat maybe every weekend a bit of candy/chocolate/chips.

3. Exams are really stressful and binging/purging is a way to relieve that stress. Maybe you can find ways to decrease your stress levels by other lifestyle factors. Do sleep, drink enough? Maybe go for a walk? I know this isn't easy but please try to find something that relaxes you and don't binge/purge.

I hope I helped you in any way. I do think it's great that you're going to therapy and I'm a 100% sure that things will get better for you. I believe in you and know that you're not alone so please stay strong! Xx",sleazysnail,1557830985.0,2019-05-14 05:49:45,"Firstly I’m really sorry you’re going through this but am happy you’ll be going to therapy during the summer...!!!

Hopefully my advice can help at least a little bit. 

- Put your mental health first, if you need a break from education there is absolutely no shame in that at all...!!! If a runner broke their leg people wouldn’t expect them to go running. If school is making you stressed and then triggering binges, which I assume causes more stress  (a vicious cycle) you can take a break. 

- I know the shame and how you must be feeling with the weigh gain and binging, is horrible and yet very difficult to stop binging. But it is good to go outside, but if you can go for a walk even if it’s at 7am when there are few people about, maybe go to a park and read a book. I know it might sound silly but I promise you will feel a little brighter because of it. 

- have a move around of your room. When I binged it was always in my bedroom, I always associated the room with sadness, guilt and binging.  Then one thing that helped me was doing a huge clean out and rearranging my room. It helps, I was proud of how the new room looked and didn’t want to ruin it. Again sounds silly but it’s effective. 

- set simple rules for yourself. For example the room you most commonly binge in, make a rule that you can’t eat in that room unless someone else is there. Throw out and don’t buy triggering foods, only have foods you feel safe around ( I haven’t binged for about close to a year now but if biscuits are in the house I know it’ll be a disaster)

- give yourself a daily budget for food and drink 

- one thing that helped me was eating foods that kept me full, roast vegetables, porridge (a saviour for me) and a meal plan, it doesn’t need to be specific foods but maybe like breakfast at 8, snack at 11:30 etc

- it’s okay to have a treat food once in a while, but if you think you will lose control have it with a family member or friend so you won’t binge anything

- you will have bad days. but it’ll get better and soon you’ll have way more good days then bad. 

This is getting a little long so I’ll leave it there, hope it helped a little",edie43,1557852855.0,2019-05-14 11:54:15,"I know it’s been said, but I want you to realise the importance: you’ve taken a huge step in getting help and you should be very proud.

Even ten thousand calories at once has a truly negligible effect on how you will look, and keeping them down is the only way for your body and your brain to prevent binges and make you feel a hell of a lot better. Plus, food is tasty AND keeps you alive (though I ignored that for 5+ years...). I remember wanting to get rid of the bloating and the feeling of ""getting fatter"" but every meal you keep down is one step towards you getting healthier and to a point where your body can regulate your hunger to keep you at a healthy weight (which ended up being less than my recovery weight).

Acupuncture and TCM herbs to balance whatever was out of balance
Obviously find someone very experienced

As far as nutrition goes - 
If you can eat more fat that will probably help but if not taking some borage/starflower oil or something will probably be helpful 
CLA is a fat source that people actually take to make sure they don’t gain so if you are super scared then that’s an option 

Other than that spoonfuls of oil are scary but really good for you 
Coconut, hemp, walnut,pumpkin, olive - preferably cold pressed 

You could consider looking into amino acids that help with serotonin and dopamine such as l Theanine and l phenylalanine
Oh and l tryptophan/5htp

B vitamins are really good too a high quality (preferably methylated) b complex would probably help 

Magnesium is also vitally important for anxiety issues 
I like mag mal (energy for the body) or if you can get mag glycinate (more for sleep,muscle relaxation) or mag threonate sounds like this one would help you most)

Dark green leafy veggies, good fat sources, cover your amino acid base/protein and you may find a carb source helpful for serotonin",Fixxxer_3,1557805690.0,2019-05-13 22:48:10,"Hey thanks!!

664,bsbc79,backstrokerjc,1558665207.0,2019-05-23 21:33:27,"Depends. Eating disorders are known as ""ego-syntonic"" disorders in the psych world. In normal language, that means that you broadly want what the disorder ""wants"". You are not arguing with a voice in your head about whether to eat; you are convinced that for whatever reason you need to eat less/exercise more/lose weight/purge/whatever behavior the ED is ""telling"" you to do. It *can* be difficult to recognize this as a problem, especially in the early stages when you are also getting societal feedback that you are doing the right thing. (""Did you go on a diet? You look so thin!"") However, my experience at least was that I knew something was wrong: I wasn't happy, I was obsessed with food and exercise, I weighed myself constantly and had panic attacks when I couldn't weigh myself. I didn't want to admit that all of those things were a problem, because I also *needed* to be doing them, *wanted* to be doing them. I think the important distinction is between being able to recognize something is wrong, and being able to recognize that you need help. The former can be there, but in my experience having an ED and talking to others with similar experiences, people with EDs will almost never get help on their own. They have it ""under control"", they ""just want to get to x weight, then they'll stop"", etc. With an ED it's easy to live in the day-to-day of strict food and exercise rules, and not look at the long-term trajectory: you didn't stop when you hit your first goal, you're not going to stop no matter what weight or pant size you reach. That line of thought just isn't there: it's all behaviors and a fear of gaining any of the weight back. This is why an outside observer usually needs to be the one to initiate treatment: they *can* see the overall trajectory, not muddled by the trappings of the disease mentality. 

This leads to some pretty interesting mental processes once the nature of the disorder is brought to the person's attention. At least in my case, it created a kind of ""split-brain"" thing, where the rational part of my brain knew I needed to eat, and knew I wasn't going to get fat from eating a normal amount of food and not exercising as much. But the part of my brain that was stuck in the disease mentality went into full-blown panic at the prospect of needing to stop exercising, or eating dessert, or gaining weight *at all.* I am not and was not dumb; I knew how the body works and that it needs fuel, but the cycle of disordered thinking is really hard to break and really hard to argue with.

671,brmn08,creativeaidan,1558529206.0,2019-05-22 07:46:46,"Cross country/track was the environment in which I developed my eating disorder, so this is an issue near to my heart. It's unfortunately horrifically common in the sport, given the emphasis on speed and thinness. The extent to which you help I guess depends on how open you are about your struggle and how comfortable you are in talking with the other girls who are suffering from the same thing.

The first thing that came to mind is very subtle, but if you have team dinners the night before a meet, model taking an appropriate portion of food (Which, for an athlete would mean pretty much filling your plate with complex carbs and protein--not just salad). Similarly, model bringing healthy and fuel dense snacks to the meet, and eat them on the bus on the way there/after the race where your teammates can see and get the hint that it's healthy and normal to fuel your body. Also, since the exercise itself can be a compulsive part of anorexia, model taking days off. For example, after a race you can say something about having earned a relaxing day off the next day (assuming your races are on Saturdays and so you would naturally not have organized practice on Sunday). On a non-race weekend, just drop comments on the Friday after practice about how you're looking forward to giving your body time to rest on Saturday or Sunday. If you have the means/space, offer to invite your teammates (maybe specifically invite the 4 other girls) to your house on your ""off day"" for healthy snacks and getting school work done.

It should go without saying, but model *not* doing harmful behaviors as well: no body shaming yourself/fat talk in the locker room or anywhere else, no body checking in the locker room, no weights/numbers, no ""ugh I ate *so much*, I feel fat,"" etc.

Moving to more direct ways of helping, if you're not close to your struggling teammates already, try to cultivate some kind of a friendship/mentorship (if they're younger). Even if it's not directly related to their/your ED, make it clear through your words and actions that you are there to listen to whatever they have to say. Check in with them before practice, ask them how their days were, let them know you're available if they want to talk more/in private. If you are in a more confidential conversation with one of them, and you feel comfortable doing so, disclose some things you are going through re: recovery. Silence hurts people with EDs, and our society has stigmatized us into silence and shame. Something like ""man, it can be hard to follow the meal plan my dietician gave me, but it's worth it because it helps me have energy for practice."" (Thats really corny but you get the idea). 

Finally, my XC and track teams used to have pre-season team meetings. This is more relevant for next year's XC season, but if you're feeling quite bold you could ask your coach if you could say something at the meeting, and maybe work with them/with your therapist if you have one to draft something to say to the whole team about what you've been through, the pressures of the sport, how you've progressed in recovery, etc. and sort of more publicly offer yourself as someone anyone on the team can go to for support.

There really needs to be top down support. Schools need to prioritize hiring coaches who emphasize the wellbeing of their athletes and coaches need to be aware of and address this issue in their sport. Is your coach aware of this issue on your team and taking strong efforts to create a positive, healthy environment? Ultimately there’s probably a bigger conversation to be had with the coach, athletic department, administrators, etc. to create a plan to create better conditions for student athletes. The ultimate goal should be to have happy, healthy participants who have a lifelong love of the sport, regardless of their level of achievement.

I was in your exact position, I was even going into the beginning of my sophomore year. I had been in a severe eating disorder for 5 years. I was terrified to tell my parents. Especially my mom, as my mom was having mental issues of her own as well as I knew she was anorexic in the past and I thought she’d blame herself.

I was so scared that I’d break my mom. But after one night of just feeling broken for the last time I got the courage to reach out to the eating disorder clinic near me.

I thought I ruined things with my mother but it made our relationship so much stronger. We were able to be open with each other, I was able to tell her my secrets and she was able to tell me her fears. We had better communication, and though the situation sucks, it made our relationship better.

So what I say is REACH OUT. Even if it’s not to your mom as I know that’s really hard maybe a school counselor, or teacher. Maybe ask your mom to go to therapy. You don’t have to tell her about why. You can even call [this hotline](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline) and they can help you find resources and seek treatment. :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of them has struggled since middle school like I have, and we’ve discussed our habits and thoughts a lot over time and tried to support eachother. Recently our other friend has begun to struggle, she immediately seemed treatment and was diagnosed with disordered eating. But she constantly talks about it and makes triggering comments about food, even calling us out when we eat, it’s incredibly toxic. She also posts about it on her snapchat for everyone to see. This has triggered my friend and I very badly, and we have both rapidly lost more weight and restricted further. All three of us are skinny and probably not at the healthiest weight, however I used to be not as skinny as them and couldn’t handle it, I’m much smaller now.

Im not sure what to do either, they are my best friends so I love them and have been trying to stay positive and hang with other people. But it’s obvious that we are all caught up in our eating habits and time together can be very triggering. It’s really unhealthy.

I had a “best friend” who also had an eating disorder while I had mine. I use best friends in quotations as honestly I realized the reason I was gravitated toward her and always hung around her was because she encouraged my ED behaviors. Though you do have to acknowledge that they are struggling, and honestly probably need help, you have to think of you. Staying friends with them and staying around that toxic environment will just end up pulling you down. They aren’t bad people but they just aren’t good for you and I’m sure you could find other friends you mesh with who are in healthier mine sets.

When I get these cravings I really go for the most caloric option of pizza, but I will try and follow your advice on eating healthier pizza options and see if that helps gain control. Best of wishes",problematicbeing,1558457188.0,2019-05-21 11:46:28,"when you are restricting, whether a diet or an eating disorder, your body doesn't know the difference, it just knows that there is less food coming in than it needs to run happily. The binge-restrict cycle is very common and happens to most people who diet chronically.  


The more you restrict a certain food, the more you end up wanting to eat it. Sometimes the way out of it is just to ""give in"", choose to not restrict and not label it as good or bad, just a neutral craving. And honor it. So if you want pizza every day for a week, let yourself. Or 2 weeks, or a month, or whatever. The point is to convince your brain that there is no lack of food in your environment. When a food is no longer forbidden, no longer restricted, no longer moralized, you will still enjoy it, but the urge to binge in large quantities in short periods of time will likely dissipate.

&amp;#x200B;

I followed this with ice cream. There was a point where I wanted ice cream every single day, sometimes multiple bowls of it. This was after a ""diet"" that lead to a full on eating disorder relapse. For like a month or 2, I was eating ice cream every night, in whatever amount I wanted. It's been like 5 months since then and despite having ice cream in the fridge, available, I haven't craved it in months. I tried having a bowl the other night and I couldn't finish it. I still enjoy ice cream, but its no longer a forbidden fruit. It's just something I'll have sometimes.  


Dieting and ED recovery aren't compatible though. You can't try to shrink your body, but also try to heal your relationship with food. The Food Psych Podcast was very helpful for me in my recovery from diet culture and the diet mentality- the bold concept is that diets don't work long term(even 'lifestyle changes' usually end up with a 95% weight regain after 5 years).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the flipside, there are some sports that lend themselves much more to body positivity and or welcome a wider range of body types. Yoga and triathlon come to mind as being a couple. I think in these contexts tracking your personal progress or achievement on social media is more about performance and fueling rather than examining the aesthetics of a specific body part or obsessing over macro-nutrients.

I chose to be vegan so that my actions align with my moral compass. I finally feel like I am not contributing to animal cruelty. And it feels good. 

I also feel healthier than I've ever been!

You can eat really unhealthy foods as a vegan (ice cream, chips, chocolate, fries, etc.) BUT, it's also possible to eat really well and to make healthy choices.

Just make sure you're not restricting calories and you're not being vegan to lose weight. Make sure you're doing it for one of the following reasons, or all of them (or others that I can't think of):

- to save the planet
- to be compassionate to animals
- for your health 

It's not to lose weight.

For people who say it's for weight loss, remind them that a lot of vegans gain weight by being junk food vegans. 

Remind them that it's NOT a diet. It's a moral choice. An ethical choice. That's all. 

You can do this! And don't be hard on yourself if you make a mistake. No one is perfect. We're just trying to be kinder to other animals. We're just trying to stop their suffering. We're not trying to lose weight.

Now, looking at a plate of food, I know that no animals have been harmed in the making of it and I feel good about eating it. 

On top of that, there are many vegan junk food alternatives, so I think a way to convince people that being vegan isn't a way to lose weight is by eating those as well.

I'm so sorry you're stuck there, but I'm happy you're reaching out! The fact that you even did is probably a good sign that you know what you should do, but you've still got that ED voice up there telling you otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I just can’t seem to convince myself that I can eat the recommended amount of calories and not put on a shit ton of weight. 

You'll gain initially, but just because your body doesn't trust you to feed it right now. It thinks it has to hold on to everything, so it will until it feels like it can trust you to nourish it. That's *exactly* the reason to not restrict. Aside from it making training properly really hard to do, you're just feeding right back into that mistrust. Not to mention, you run the risk of doing some serious damage to your body. 

I put on 50ish lbs when I started to recover and it leveled out over time but only after I started eating enough consistently. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But I’m also overweight and want to at least be in the normal bmi range. But I also just feel like it would be so much easier to just eat less.

Falling back into ED thoughts/habits is 10000% more harmful &amp; unhealthy than a high BMI/weight. Plus, a healthy weight is different from person to person, and if you're restricting then your body isn't able to find its set point. It's too worried about saving energy for the next ""famine"" if that makes sense? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Particularly of note... I’m back at home for 3 weeks with my mum so essentially no friends that know about this to keep an eye on me, no psychologist, no uni to distract me and a mum who is very judgemental about eating and actively encourages dieting

If you're already thinking this way, that's another huge red flag. EDs thrive in isolation, and that's a slippery slope that I really hope you can keep yourself away from.

But seriously, if not a full inpatient, seek therapy, because these thoughts do not go away on their own but WILL likely go away with therapy and hard work.",IronLok,1559599480.0,2019-06-03 17:04:40,"Everything you’re describing is ABSOLUTELY NORMAL. 
You’ve restricted your body for so long and have ignored your hunger cues, your body is so relieved you’re finally listening. It’s afraid it’s going to be starved again and feels like it needs to stock up on food. 

You’re going to be bloated for a while and honestly it feels so terrible... However, once your weight evens out and your body gets used to constant nutrition you’re going to feel so much better. I’ve been weight restored with a few ups and downs for around 2 years now and I could never see myself deteriorating this much ever again. 

The freedom of not being concerned by food, calories and what I look like is something that is so incredibly beautiful. I feel like a different person.

You have a difficult path ahead of you, it’s going to be emotionally and tiring. You’re going to feel like giving up and your disorder will whisper sweet lies to you. You’re going to be bloated, you’re going to be moody, you’re going to be so hungry and you’re going to be questioning yourself.

Remind yourself that you are not your disorder, your weight is not all you have to offer to the world and you can get through this.

Surround yourself with people who will support you, see a therapist, be prepared to buy new clothes to fit your new body and don’t forget that this pain is temporary but will bring you fruit.
Nothing is more rewarding than overcoming your demons.

I just want to add that there may come a time when you realize you can’t do it on your own-  please please please do go to inpatient if you ever get to that point.  I waited till I was 27 and I feel like I missed out on what should have been the best years of my life.   At 27, after years of outpatient therapy and still struggling, I went inpatient and it was one of my best decisions.  It broke my patterns and helped me learn how to eat, how to deal with emotions and cope without resorting to my ED. 

There is life after and ED and it’s AMAZING!    Takes a ton of work but so worth it.

Inpatient was truly difficult because your control is completely taken away but it forces you to confront your fear foods, helps you establish proper meal times/portions and you can often relate to a lot of the patients there.

One of the trickiest things about recovery is the process of refeeding, which is VERY prone to obstacles/challenges. People have had a lot of issues with this, and sometimes -- I don't want to scare you -- things like your heart can go into a state of danger. The least of your worries is the bloat, which is something that is also somewhat preventable when refeeding IF it's done properly.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that the inpatient option seems horrendous, but I did it for 75 days, and if I can do it, ANYONE of us can!!! You're so much stronger than I am. I was 43 years old at the time, and 13 years into my VERY severe AN. You're young and still able to conquer this before it consumes your mind for so long...(I am presuming, and if you've had it for a long long time, I apologize!).  

&amp;#x200B;

What happens at inpatient? You'll make great friends, you will find that you're NOT alone, you will have an RD to help guide your meal intake properly, so that you're safe and your body can tolerate all these changes. You'll be back in the saddle after only a relatively short time. Think about how awesome it would be to just let go of this for once, and never have to look back. If you guys have insurance, think about how many other people out there don't. Some people would love this opportunity, and you can totally take advantage. I met the best friends of my life, and the most wonderful part was that I could feel supported as we all took the plunge together. Food is not meant to be a fear, and you can conquer it.  Please trust a professional to help you.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to gain a huge amt of weight - not kidding - and it all happened within 2-3 months. And: I never had terrible bloat. I also had a medical team that made SURE I was going #2 on a daily basis, even when they had to use some medications that weren't totally pleasant, LOL.  You'll have all of that at a great place, and if you go to the one nearest you, 3 hours is easy for your folks to visit often. I went to the Meadows (formerly Remuda) Ranch, and it is my strongest hope that you'll consider something similar OR go there yourself.",Yellowhairedbaby,1559662608.0,2019-06-04 10:36:48,"when this happened to me I looked into eating suuuper healthy to compensate with all the bloating. Right now, you are probably craving greasy, cheesy, fried, sugary, processed food. Look into the Nutritarian diet, or Chef AJ. Both of those people will help immensely. Pretty low fat/high card vegan diets, but you will feel amazing. All the nutrients help with the depression and restore the gut microbiome as well.  I know people will say ""too healthy"" is bad.. but I feel fucking amazing and sooo free. I look forward to eating a bunch of fresh frui for breakfast, a huge salad piled with veggies and beans for lunch, and a delicious soup/stew for dinner. Highly recommend!!

I had to force myself in the beginning and your ED will try and stop you from eating. It will be the hardest thing but it gets easier I promise. I’m 5 months in recovery and swear by this.",taylermeagiin,1559672439.0,2019-06-04 13:20:39,"&gt;It’s been about a week now and I’m hungry all the time and am eating practically 24/7 except for when I’m sleeping. 

Totally normal! Your body has a TON of internal damage to repair and it desperately needs the calories to do so. On top of needing to repair, your body doesn't trust you to feed it consistently yet so it's trying to get the nutrients it needs now so that it can take care itself during the upcoming ""famine"". Absolutely honor those hunger cues! I would eat upwards of 5k calories a day for months after I started with the crazy hunger cues. [Tabitha Farrar](https://tabithafarrar.com/2017/01/extreme-hunger-anorexia-recovery/) &amp; [Mia](https://www.instagram.com/whatmiadidnext/) both have amazing resources for this :) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My stomach looks like I am 6 months pregnant and im experiencing severe constipation. I don’t even want to leave the house at this point because of how I look. Is all of this normal? 

Yep - but I know it isn't fun. Your digestion slows when you aren't eating enough/consistently, and it's going to take some time for your system to repair and kick back into gear. The trick here is drinking plenty of fluids, hot baths, and heating pads :) Please remember to keep an eye out for signs of refeeding syndrome. You'll need to go to the ER asap if you start to notice these as it can be deadly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever you do, just don't restrict. Your body is healing and learning to trust you again. You wouldn't hack off a cast and try to run on a leg you broke a week ago, and this is similar. If you can, reach out to get support through a therapist, BetterHelp, or ANAD Support Group near you. EDs are so much more than physical and, although weight gain and restoration are 100000% crucial, it isn't going to bring you all the way to recovery. Please always feel free to reach out if you need anything! I'm in recovery as well and I know it can be rough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't know your age or situation obviously, but I am in recovery for 14 years of anorexia. When I went to treatment last summer (at The Meadows Ranch, which I highly recommend)...I met several people with something called ""ARFID"" - avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder.  

My friend had a problem of throwing up unintentionally, coupled with panic/sweating from fear of that. She ate, but still had trouble eating enough to be normal and healthful about it. She was not severely underweight, but this still resulted in health deficits AND her being somewhat underweight.  

This is all part of the world of eating disorders, so there is definitely help and many opportunities to resolve it. If you can, talk to a parent or someone you trust to help you get to the next step. You can:

1. Go to your family doctor and explain what you said here.
2. They will refer you to en ED specialist for proper diagnosis. 
3. If they don't listen, they are a horrible doctor - go to doctors who are reputable in your area.

1) Change Your thought processes and view food differently. My wife always talked about changing one’s relationship with food, and what this meant in my case was to commit to changing how I eat and, eventually, Hotwire my brain to consider food as fuel *before* pleasure. This takes a long time.

2. Tell everyone you live with to hold you accountable for your goals to stop night eating. What this means is that your housemates will be pains in the arses and call you out when you get up to have a snack.

3. Fill up on water to curb your appetite and write on a piece of paper that the kitchen is “closed” at a certain time, and put it where you will always see it right away.

I’m not a therapist but I have an eating disorder. All aspects of changing compulsive eating involve a lot patience, hard work and repetition.

I don't know what kind of relationship you have with your parents, sometimes you're more confortable with one of them (that's the case for me, I talk way more to my mom than my dad, although I love them both). Maybe you can try to talk to one of them in private, one evening, with something like ""Hey I got something pretty important to tell you...""

Or another solution would be to just write. I wrote to my mom when I wanted to admit dark things about me. I think this is the case here for you. If you're confortable enough with writing, pit your words on paper. Wait a little, reread it the day after so you're sure you're being clear and got to the point you wanted to make. Then leave the note in a nice enveloppe, and put it where the personn will find it when they are alone and will have alone time to read it. Or write on it ""read this when you're alone and you got time"".

Just so you know, be ready to cry like a baby when they will come to you to chat after. But those were good tears. They helped me understand how much my family cared about me.

Eventually if you wrote to just your mom (for example), they'll let your dad know too. Just know that you don't have to confront them if you want to talk directly to them, as it is a tough subject. Maybe write why you were afraid to bring this up earlier or by talking.

Because a lot of the behaviors around ED's are hidden, parents might not know what they can actually say or do in a practical sense that will help - some essential knowledge is really important, so perhaps giving them a book or some articles they can read in addition to telling them will be really useful.

Each time was started by a very well intentioned attempt to lose weight the healthy way without relapsing. And each time, within a few weeks-months, whatever healthy goals I had set, turned into spiraling into my eating disorder and losing weight but in an unhealthy way.  


For me personally, I cannot lose weight the healthy way, so I choose to work on self-acceptance. Manipulating my body didn't work. But accepting my body as it is today, without any changes, even when it is really difficult, does work.    


Working out is something I do, but I do it because its enjoyable and relaxing and helps my stress levels.

You say it's only been a few months and that's not a lot of time. Right now your main priority is making sure you are eating enough. If your clothes don't fit, get new clothes and toss the old ones. People are asking about your weight? Tell them it's not their business. You need time to heal and accept your body. Don't listen to anyone else and eat what you want to eat. If you are struggling with eating healthy meals then I suggest getting a nutritionist that specializes in eating disorders. They can help you identify what a healthy weight is for you and what a healthy meal plan is for you. 

There's no rush with recovery and it's okay to not work out or eat ""healthy"" all the time. My advice: slow down and take your time. Get help and support. Just make sure you're eating enough and that you're healthy. And when I say healthy I don't mean physically fit or eating salads or bullshit like that.

You have to start playing mind games with yourself. Sometimes, you have to talk to yourself as if you’re a toddler, trying to convince yourself of the reality, but in a roundabout way.

If it was your little sister or brother going through this, what would you say? Everyone’s situation is different, so you have to partly decide that for yourself.

If you think you’re too big, remind yourself that being “thicc” is a thing. It’s desirable. Of course, being healthy is another aspect to this. Perhaps start by doing basic little exercises. And I mean really small, and really basic (I’m not sure how much you exercise right now). I often do squats and similarly small exercises while brushing my teeth, waiting for something to boil/the microwave to finish etc.

Also, *positively* encourage yourself, not negatively. You already know what foods are “healthy” and “unhealthy.” Now you just need to convince yourself to eat the right things. I know I’m being vague, but that’s because I don’t know your precise situation. Again, talk to yourself as if you were a close relative or loved one. After all, that’s what you should be.

“Hey, honey, I know you don’t want to eat this, but it’s so great for you! And you know what? You can even enjoy it! How about we both go to the kitchen and make it reaaaally yummy? I have an amazing recipe, and you’ll end up loving it!”

This can be applied to both under and overeaters. We all just need to start seeing food in a positive light.

Just start treating yourself like the person you’re meant to love. Look at yourself from a third-person point of view, and always ask yourself what you would tell that person if they were your best friend.",WanderingLions,1560226591.0,2019-06-10 23:16:31,"At first honestly, the only thing i really knew about was just straight up jumping into healthy land.

Think of it this way: before you got an eating disorder, you still had times where you overate a little bit at Thanksgiving, right? You felt some guilt there, but it went away after like a day, and you just left it be.

Similarly to this, you gotta take it one day at a time. Don’t look at “what about 20 years from now”. No no no shhhhh. Just take baby steps. No baby could ever stand up and start walking the earth like that and going for 5 mile runs. No, they started off with moving their arms and legs, crawling, trying to stand up, standing up, trying to walk and maybe falling once or twice, and finally being able to walk. They then picked up skills to run.

Sorry for the weird analogy. My point is that after a while, you start to get accustomed to not throwing up, but you MUST take it one step at a time. I’m still learning this too. I still deal with BED and constant insecurities about myself and my body, but I’m starting off first with loving myself and treating myself right, then when that’s taken care of, then I take care of my binge eating and do things to forget about it. Then, I might try and look for some hobbies to distract me and make me feel good (for me, it’s drawing right now). Then, I might look at my exercising habits and go at a good pace for it. Do you see me doing these things in 1 day? No, I’m going to be doing them one day at a time, starting now because I’ve been slipping a lot!

At times I’ve been so depressed and caught up in my illness that all I’ve wanted to do is die, so that I don’t have to live like this any more; the most recent time I felt like this would have been maybe 8 months ago. 

Today, I was thinking about making a post saying how much better I feel at the moment. Since March, I’ve really turned a corner. I’ve been watching what I eat less, haven’t binged, and have only purged maybe 4 times or so. 8 months ago I was caught up in my usual pattern of starve as long as I can stand it, finally cave, eat a huge meal, then purge immediately afterwards. This most recent spell lasted over 2 years. I felt so utterly hopeless and like a total failure having fallen right back into the same shit that destroyed my enjoyment of life when I was still just a kid.

Last week I purged and admitted as much to my partner, and cried about how sorry I was. And he gently reminded me that it was the first time I’d done so in weeks, that he doesn’t expect the problem to go away overnight and that I shouldn’t either. I hadn’t even realised until he mentioned it how well I’ve been doing. I’ve broken the cycle of needing to purge every time I eat. I’ve broken the cycle of needing to purge every time I feel full. The part I haven’t come to grips with yet is purging when I feel overly full, or know I’ve consumed over my rough mental calorie budget for the day. But I’ve made progress. 

You will get better. You will get worse. You will be unable to cope sometimes. You’ll break down, and cry, and not want to go on any more. You’ll beat yourself up. You will feel like you should be able to change this and fix it yourself, you will feel like this is a choice you are making, and you will blame yourself. Sometimes you will tell people who understand, sometimes you’ll tell people who make you feel even worse about it. Sometimes you’ll want to die, and sometimes you’ll be so angry that you’re like this you will find an unexpected motivation to get better. Some therapy will help, some will be next to useless.

This illness is not your fault. It is just that, an illness. It is not something you will always be able to control. It is not a choice.

The choice that is in your hands, is to start back up the road to recovery. If therapy is too costly, or you’re not ready to make a start yet, you can take some small steps yourself, and start to make some small choices to battle this. The first is to be as kind to yourself as you possibly can be. Try and wean yourself off some of those daily ED rituals, like weighing yourself multiple times, measuring your wrist with your fingers, admiring your protruding bones in the mirror. Don’t try and rush yourself into stopping altogether, just put it off for a while and make those intervals longer and longer. 

Find a new focus in life to take up your thoughts. Learning a language can be great like this. If you catch yourself calorie counting, switch to rattling off as many numbers as you can in your target language. If you have any foods you consider safe, increase your portion size of those to get yourself used to the feeling of being full; leafy greens, low calorie fruit etc. Gradually build on that so maybe just a bowl of plain spinach gets a few additions, like tomato, red onion, feta etc. until you’re up to a full salad. Don’t rush yourself, but not don’t let yourself get away with too much either. This is about rebuilding your relationship with food, in a healthy way.

I’ve done this for 18 years. It does get better. Your relationship with food will improve. There might be times you relapse, and that’s ok. You’ll get better again. As somebody who is well aware this is an issue I am still in the thick of, please feel free to take any of my advice with a grain of salt. These are just techniques I’ve found that have helped. I’m not a licensed therapist by any means, despite how many I’ve seen. What I can tell you is that this will get better, and you are not alone.

I am smart, talented, and funny. (Etc.)” it feels kind of silly to do out loud at first but even combating the voice in your head at first and working your way up to doing it out loud helps.

737,c2u5gq,houston_veronica,1561034224.0,2019-06-20 07:37:04,"I totally understand; I work around people who are constantly talking about Keto and being gluten-free or cutting out carbs (not because they have celiac, they don't have that).  I know people who randomly don't eat all day because they are too busy, and they discuss this like it's just funny etc.  

The point I'm trying to make is: we cannot escape it. Somehow, you will need to develop the tolerance to allow others to do whatever they need to do. It would be difficult to educate anyone who has never had an ED to TRULY feel what we all have felt. I feel that's an impossibility.  Therefore, they won't truly understand how it impacts us, and we cannot expect them to make that connection. 

What I would suggest is that you compromise, and allow your SO to do whatever he needs to do to quietly log his info on MFP or mind his own dietary needs. After all, losing weight isn't wrong, and everyone has their own health to handle.  But, if he starts to talk about it, then you can perhaps suggest he share these convo's with other people, or chat with folks at the gym, etc.  

Remember that it is not a bad thing to lose weight- but we took it too far, and that creates a trigger in us that is our own responsibility to handle.  It will be a total defeat if you try to ED-proof your surroundings, as there are just too many opportunities for it to get triggered.

I'm sorry for not being more ""against"" the diet for your SO, but just try your best to keep your eyes and focus on your own plate.  When I was in inpatient, there were people who refused to eat, and I was occasionally the only one who was cooperative in eating my food. What I realized (and was instructed to do) was: keep. my. eyes. on. my. own. plate! And, recognize that everyone is on a different journey.

I think it's totally appropriate to tell the partner that weight and diet talk needs to be discussed with another friend, if you are still in recovery or having any temptation to ED thoughts. After all, if your partner is into card games or watching a sport, and you're not into that, well then that's just what he / she does with other friends. Likewise if he / she is into a new diet / fitness routine- and assuming it is not obsessive / destructive, then it shouldn't be any more important then some other hobby.

Based on the fact you both live together, I can only assume you've been dating for some time. Communication is key in so many aspects of life including relationships and eating disorders. Not only will being honest with him lift the weight (no pun intended) off you,  but it could make your relationship a lot stronger. What is the worse that can happen by telling him the honest truth about the severity of your history with ED? He breaks up with you? That is highly unlikely. 

A few years ago, I started dating someone while in the middle of recovering from my ED (relapsed since then unfortuantely). He was great, spoiled me, told me I was beautiful 24/7, was kind &amp; gentle. The only bad thing? He had the diet of a 2 year old. He hated fruits and vegetables and would always be eating sweets, pastries, drinking Rockstar's all day, pretty much nothing with nutritional value, etc...but OF COURSE he had the body of a god because he was a professional athlete. Anyway, his foods of choice were all my trigger foods. So after our first few months of dating, I made up some bullshit excuses and kept trying to avoid seeing him, even though I thought he was amazing. Thankfully, he was very perssistent and I finally opened up about everything to him which was the best thing  I could have done. It changed our entire relationship. He learned not to constantly ask me out to ice cream or bring me sweets and cookies. He would let me pick the restaurants we ate at so I could be sure the menu would have things I would be comfortable eating. I was able to openly talk about so many aspects of my ED, anxiety, depression with him. The relationship ended a couple years later for different reasons, but I will say opening up to someone I loved about my struggles was so helpful. 

I am sure it would be the same for you and your SO :)

It’s perfectly natural what you’re feeling and all of us that go through it feel it. I would say talk to someone who was in charge of helping you through your disorder, like a your therapist if you have one.

I'm always wondering what thin women eats, how much they exercise etc. I have also noticed that I almost unconciously press at skinny women photos on instagram discover.

Good luck!",MyOversoul,1560851814.0,2019-06-18 04:56:54,"This will sound strange maybe, but what you are experiencing is called projection. The only vantage point your mind has to rely on is its own, the one it has lived up to this point in life. So how you feel and what you believe about yourself, your mind has to assume is true for everyone else it meets. Most of the people around you are experiencing this same 'my point of view is reality for everyone'. So the person that feels confident and great, doesnt experience the belief that others see their fat and are judging them on it. Nor are they in fact doing what your brain is telling you they are in judging you either. They are living in their own reality where you are just another person bliping in and out of their world. They actually barely notice you because they are focused on their own reality. That group of teens giggling while looking in your direction at the mall? Not laughing at you despite what your brain says. One of them was talking about a boy in school, one of them looked in the general direction of a store she wanted to take the group too and the others turn to see what shes looking at. Etc.   


I tell you this to say, yes it probably is body dysmorphia. Your mind has become very focused on one subject and its doing it for a reason. The brain can sometimes sometimes get 'addicted' to high levels of emotionally caused hormonal responses. This emotion causes stress and discomfort? Okay, lets swing to that, then once it finishes with those high  levels of stress, it swings to a thought that causes a sense of control calm and comfort , it making us feel good. It seesaws back and forth between these polar opposites. YOU arent doing it, your brain is. Its not your fault, your brain just doesnt know how to get out of the pattern of seesawing. A more obvious example of this are people who get a 'high' off of physical activities that can be somewhat dangerous like skydiving or rock climbing. Brain starts to seek out those activities even though they are risky to their safety because of the high they get from the chemical/hormonal releases they cause brain to give them.   


I have read that when we have a new thought or idea it creates a type of 'grove' or line in the brain. For example a simple one would be brain goes ""doughnut, eating, fat, weight gain, sadness"". If brain repeatedly thinks that pattern the groove gets deeper and deeper so that every time we see doughnuts, it makes the groove so deep that all we have to do is think of that type of food or foods similar to it,  we feel sadness. Eventually its any kind of pastry, then it expands to anything with flour in it and so forth until the category that elicit sadness is so large and the emotion about those foods so overwhelming, that we cut those foods completely from our diet and maybe even feel physically nauseous just thinking about or seeing them.  And we become ever more convinced that doughnuts are bad because we are believing the thought and feeling the emotion that brain tells us belongs with 'doughnuts' (sadness).   


This is getting way to long so Im going to stop here and see if this makes any sense to you or is just a waste of typing. &lt;3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Try to convince your parents to come as well, but if they refuse, or if you think they'll try to stop you if you tell them, the most important thing is getting your sibling to a doctor. If the office asks why you're calling and not your parents, say she has told you she has an ED but your parents aren't taking it seriously. An official evaluation *might* convince your parents to remove their heads from their asses, but it will also open doors for referral to psychiatrists, therapists, and nutritionists. Be aware, depending on the severity of your sister's illness the doctor might recommend a higher level of care (residential or intensive outpatient programs).

If your parents wait until her teeth are rotting it will be so much more difficult to treat. It’s not just about her food and eating non acidic food- it’s about her mental health which she needs a professional to help her get out of these ED thoughts and behaviors. 

If you can’t get her in to an appointment with an ED doctor or therapist on your own, this may be a question for r/legaladvice.",Toast_in_the_Toaster,1560705566.0,2019-06-16 12:19:26,"I am so sorry this is happening to you. I have an ED (developed after leaving home) but I'm terrified that one of my siblings will develop one and that my parents will not handle it well seeing as they handled it horribly with me. 

The biggest thing I can recommend is talk to your sibling, in person. NEDA (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org) has some great resources for how to talk to a loved one about this and they have an instant-chat where you can talk to someone and get guidance with your situation. Seeing as your parents are brushing off this huge problem, your sibling needs to know that they have someone who cares and supports them. It's important that when you talk to them you don't judge or shame them, just listen to them. You sibling is calling for help by telling you about this. If your parents won't do anything then it's time to step up. Remember: people die from this disease. That's the harsh reality. Your sibling needs to get help somehow. 

As others have already suggested, see what you can do about making a doctor's appointment/therapist appointment on your siblings behalf. If you explain the situation they may allow the appointment to be made without the parents. Granted, I am not sure how effective this would be as there is concern with patient privacy and whatnot. Also, if you have a therapist/doctor, go see them and ask them what you can do. Additionally, it's possible your siblings won't want to go to an appointment even if you do schedule one. 

There's tons of stuff online that you can educate yourself with. I do suggest r/legaladvice for the child services question...but I'd keep that as a last resort. Eating disorders are hard for people to understand and parents struggle dealing with them. I'm sure your parents do not intend to cause harm or neglect your sibling...they probably don't know how to handle it and eating disorders are secretive by nature so they can't see the damage it's doing. 

I hope your sibling is able to get the help they need.",deena812044,1560771822.0,2019-06-17 06:43:42,"Oh my gosh, I am so sorry you're going through this, but so impressed that you are putting so much care and effort in!

As someone who has been officially diagnosed with ED, and who is going through Intensive Outpatient Therapy, I can definitely say:

1) a person can definitely hide bulimia from roommates and a husband, even through decades.  As a teenager I got ""caught"", and unfortunately this just made me very smart about hiding it in the future

2) tooth damaged is highly variable, and no dentist ever noticed or said anything to me

3) Ed can destroy someone even without vomiting, there are many ways to restrict or purge

4) the sooner someone help, the less ingrained the crazy thoughts and behaviors will be.

In my first consult, my doctor and nutritionist prohibited me from checking my weight. My doctor would check my weight every 6 months or so to keep it in the medical record, but other than that, he said there are waaay too many things that can change in one’s body. Weight is in no way a reflection of a person’s health. He said my lab work was perfectly normal— and that’s what matters.

I suggest you do blind weights. That means don’t look at the scale when someone weighs you. When you step on the scale for someone to weigh you, like a nurse, just let them know you don’t want to know your weight because you’re recovering from an eating disorder. They should understand completely.

If you want to monitor your exercise resistance, try keeping a journal of how many repetitions of an exercise you can do without feeling tired, and gradually increase the number a bit. That will be a much healthier way to encourage you to listen to your body instead of a scale.

It's expected that if you start working out, you're going to gain weight because you are gaining more muscle mass. And if you're exercising you 100% should be eating more food to make up for lost calories. 
And 5 pounds is not much, your weight can fluctuate 5lbs in a day easily. Nobody would be able to notice this ""weight gain"" so this perceived coldness and indifference is NOT because of your body.

I come from a history of binging and restriction. In my personal experience, exercising has been amazing for my physical and mental health. Exercising has allowed me to get in touch with my body in ways I couldn’t before. I can tell when my body needs more fuel (food), when it has had too much food, etc. Even if there are times when I overeat a little, or have a little “episode” of “binging,” my body is much better equipped to give me signals to stop overfeeding it and to handle it when I do eat a lot. However, I will mention that I chose to not exercise for a long time during the beginning of my recovery because of the risk that it would become a form of calorie compensation. Whenever I feel like there’s a chance I might be exercising to compensate for my calorie intake, I try to refrain from doing so as it would make me associate eating with punishment. (This also applies to days where I had already planned to go to the gym, but ended up eating a lot or something I’m still fearful of. Even though I had already planned it, there may be a chance that my intentions of exercising may have changed slightly to compensate.) I think exercising is amazing. I love seeing my body become stronger. As long as you’re in a state and mindset of using exercise as a means to become healthier, separate from whatever and however you’re eating, I think you should be fine.

After years of binge eating disorder, I developed orthorexia. That's the danger of working out during recovery and turning workouts/strict meal plans into a new disorder. It's very easy to switch the control to another area and not realize you're just as sick but in a different way.  "" I want to be strong"" easily becomes the new ""I want to be skinny"" since our current society dictates that being more muscular is the new desirable body type.  
If the main reason or main concern you have with working out relates to weight, take a step back to see if you really do love exercising. The only reason you should do anything right now is because you love it, not because it affects your weight or muscle tone or because you put a rule around it ( ""I HAVE to workout 3x a week"" for example). Finding a physical activity like rock climbing, circus school, outdoor biking, hiking etc... that isn't a weight loss focused activity (like let's say cross fit and bootcamp classes) can make all the difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What you’re describing is a symptom of low blood sugar. Your hunger cues maybe messed up a bit so that you don’t feel hungry until your blood sugar is too low. Please keep in mind I’m only guessing, I could be way off. 

What if recommend though is try to anticipate it. Try to get some food somewhere between the stomach growl but before the weakness.

(I’m not a doctor or dietician, and I struggle with eating enough food/the opposite problem as you I assume, so take what I say with a grain of salt). If you’re eating an appropriate amount of protein, carbs, and fats (for your body) then you should feel satisfied until your next meal. I have to meal plan to make sure I’m getting enough calories everyday. But not just calories, because calories from fat/protein/carbs all act differently in your body. You want to be getting the right kinds of calories more so than the right amount (just to be healthy, have energy, etc) so I’m NOT telling you to count calories!! Planning meals is more fun and flexible than counting calories anyway. I recommend seeing a nutritionist and making a longterm diet plan. This makes it harder to relapse and binge, a lot harder than just trusting yourself to use your better judgment on when you’re hungry everyday. That’s a really hard thing to do for anyone, and it’s much easier said then done, especially if you have an unhealthy relationship with food. It’s like letting a child decide when they want to eat. Instead of “eating when you’re hungry” try to plan eating so that you don’t get hungry. Eating 3 balanced meals a day, with a lot of protein in the morning (protein decreases appetite and keeps most people satisfied longer) and saving carbs for immediately after exercise or increased activity is a good starting place. But everyone is different (some people can eat protein all day and not ever be “full”) and I’d trust a dietician/nutritionist more than a therapist or myself :)",anxiousember,1561644809.0,2019-06-27 09:13:29,"I'm the OP.

Even more frustrating when you can’t project those feelings of positivity onto yourself.

Maybe journal about your unintentional judge mental thoughts. Write what your mind unintentionally rendered from maybe seeing your overweight friends fridge, and then write what you combated with like “no! It’s her body I shouldn’t project my negative self image onto my friends!”

Even better: once writing both cross the unintentional judgement out (like frickin scribble all over it) so now whenever you look at the journal you see positivity. 

Like cleansing.

If you do have to continue seeing that specific counselor for a while, try talking to him about how his responses make you feel. If that is something you are uncomfortable doing, that is very understandable. 

Your therapist should not be giving off the impression that your struggles are lesser. Many people go though truly terrible things, but that doesn’t change the affects that individual problems can have on different people. If you are paying for this service, you should be receiving the help you deserve. It is in no way a waste of their time. 

I understand that they are not specialized in ED’s, but maybe diving deeply into specific feelings, thought processes, and possible causes associated with your ED could help both the therapist understand a little better and you with sorting out your brain.

That person can help you build a meal plan to get you to a healthy weight.,LinnSamirCat,1561291685.0,2019-06-23 07:08:05,"I've been to countless eating disorder treatments (recovered now) and this is what they all say:

Normally people with eating disorders are recommended to eat 3 main meals and 2-3 snacks in between. This is because it's so easy to get hungry in between the meals and it's easier to start a binge if you're physically hungry, so I recommend to eat some snacks too and keeping the bloodsugar even this way. Snacks can be: Fruit and some digestive biscuits, fruit and a yoghurt, a toast and milk, a smoothie and some nuts or whatever you prefer. So these can be healthy and nutritious and a good complement to your main meals. 

Then it's different for different people with binge tendencies, but in general it's a very good thing to allow yourself to eat a moderate amount of sweets too (maybe not in the very first phase). This sends a message to you that no food is forbidden or bad, (which will make these food less loaded with emotions) and therefore less desireable. Over time it becomes something that you can allow yourself to eat every now and then and nothing more, nothing less. Examples of sweet snacks: an ice cream, a little bowl of crisps, a slice of cake, a muffin etc. These amounts a few times a week will not hurt your body in any way but will be beneficial in stopping making food so emotional and forbidden. But maybe it is too advanced in the very first phase of just trying to get back to regular eating throughout the day.

The most important thing you can do to avoid binge eating and in general overcome your eating disorder is to eat regularly every day. Same time, same amounts, no matter what. If you slip up and binge - get back on track as soon as possible, don't skip any meals! The regularity learns you body it can trust it's getting enough nutrition and it can start healing itself.

Regarding your symptoms when binging - read up about electrolyte imbalance! You might eat too little or too much salt, drink too little or too much (you know this best). If the balance becomes very wrong you can actually go into cardiac arrest, so these symptoms shouldn't be ignored!

Lastly (sorry for writing a fricking essay!), get professional help. If you already have professional help, ask for more. There is always a way to reach recovery, it might be slippery, but with enough dedication you can get there! You deserve to be happy and live in peace.

But we eat all the time together and little by little i became more excited about trying new foods with him and i couldn’t fast off everything.

It’s definitely all very personal, but the one thing i wished he did more was ask me how my ED recovery has been. or give me the space to talk about how i’m feeling with it. not everyone wants to talk but giving her that space might be good to try and then see her reaction.

She may not think they’ll pick up on her behaviors, but they absolutely will.  She’s also putting herself at risk every time she purges.  Maybe I’m being a bit of a dick but maybe framing that you don’t want the kids around that and that she needs to get proper help.  It will make her feel bad but she needs to hear it.  It’s not fair to you for her to continue this way but it’s really unfair to the kids.   Is there an Ed treatment center near you or one she could at least go to to do an intake assessment?  That would probably be your best bet at finding good help.  And I’d say you should go with her (not in the room) but to the appt and after she’s given her recommendation on treatment ask to talk with the intake person as a couple.  I know when I did my appt I brought my parents in to talk about what the plan was and what I needed (I was an adult but single so they were my support then).  It’s important and a lot of treatment includes family therapy so that shouldn’t be the last time you get to know what’s going on.  I’d say you have to let her know she NEEDS to get help and that you need to be in the loop.  It’s affecting your marriage and it will affect the kids so it’s not really a choice anymore.

It sounds like it could be a possibility based on what you have described, but I’m not a doctor so not trying to diagnose you or anything!

I must also say I’m not an expert on ARFID, but some thoughts that came to mind:

Sometimes when you lose weight and/or become very underweight, you lose your appetite. 

I think seeing a dietitian might be a good idea, they could help you come up with ways to eat enough that are comfortable for you. Sometimes though when you’re underweight and dealing with an eating disorder, you’ll need to forcefeed yourself for a while. Usually eating gets easier and more pleasant as your body adjusts to the increased intake and you gain some weight.

I would also consider seeing a therapist. They might be able to help you tolerate the unpleasant feelings that you have when eating, and/or help you understand why it is that eating enough is so hard for you.",cyanideNsadness,1561205006.0,2019-06-22 07:03:26,"I could have written this post word for word. This is something I’m struggling desperately with right now, even as I fight to hold on to every single pound I gain but usually watch them slip away easily. One time I acknowledged that I was hungry and got up to get something to eat, but then ended up sitting on the floor crying while my bf literally forced fruit juice into me and held my mouth shut until I swallowed it. I’m as clueless as you are. But not only do I want to gain weight for appearances, but I really have to for health as well. It’s not like I’m trying to avoid food, but yesterday I went the entire day without a single food cue and therefore, didn’t eat anything and didn’t realize it. When I try to just force myself to eat for the mechanical purpose of it, I feel nauseous and full. 

As other commenters suggested, shakes are a great option. I have strawberry ensures that I require myself to drink once a day. And it’s easy. It even tastes good! When all else fails I know I will have gotten at least that down. Drinking liquids with sugar like juice is good to replenish your body. Basically drink lots and lots, from milk to health shakes, put down as much as you can! Someone also suggested r/arfid, which you can try although I haven’t had too much luck so far? It mainly talks about “safe foods” which people have discovered are something they feel comfortable with eating at any time. For me that’s currently Mac and cheese or toast. The last thing I can suggest is maybe not doing strenuous exercise? Walking a lot to try and jog the appetite perhaps, but runs or work outs will just help you shed calories and your body won’t have anything to replace them with.

773,c3nwdu,SkeletonInMyMirror,1561209544.0,2019-06-22 08:19:04," To be quite frank; I personally think that your dad had a very inappropriate reaction to your eating disorder. Eating disorders are certainly not just a “girl thing”.  I have met many men, between the ages of 12 and 50, who suffer from both anorexia and bulimia, along with other types of eating disorders. I also think that most people are *not* going to react that way. I’m so sorry that he did.

 If you trust your family friend, and they are a true friend, it may be worth opening up to them about what you’re currently going through. They may be able to get you the help you need. Eating disorders can progress so much quicker than you’d ever imagine. They can be like a snake in the grass, creeping up on you. Then they tend to want to stick around for a very long time.

 If you are interested in not being what you may personally view to be “scrawny”,  I can promise that any ED is not going to help at all... It will only amplify those characteristics you have likely struggled with in the past. This was something I, personally, encountered as well; and I was honestly rather shocked when my doctor told me that I was at the same weight at 10 years old as I currently am at 19.

 In the end, if you’re even willing to consider telling your friend, or getting help in any other way, please try. As the earlier you can catch it, the “easier” it seems it may be to recover and reverse that mindset. It can be a terrifying jump, but it can be worth it. You can also consider telling your/a doctor.

If you do trust them, truly trust them, I would be honest with them and tell them the basics. You don’t have to be extremely detailed, but you can mention that you have lost control of this and you need help. I don’t think that they would react like your dad... but I can’t speak for them.

HAES does not say your size/shape won’t or shouldn’t change but it does say that weight is not an important indicator of health. It is much more effective to start making small incremental changes to increase your consumption of nutrient dense foods, increase your activity level, take better care of your mental health, and increase your social connectedness.

Did you know that BMI was arbitrarily invented in the 1800s to show the distribution in size is a bell curve (in Belgium!), that 200 years later health insurance companies pressured doctors to begin using it so they could charge based on size, that doctors were very resistant to the idea but eventually caved, and that in the 90s all BMI above 25 were reclassified overnight to manufacture an “epidemic” that does not actually correlate with overall health?

Statistically, those in larger bodies DO NOT have a higher mortality rate than those in smaller bodies. Did you know that if you assume someone is metabolically healthy based on BMI, research shows you will likely be wrong (80% of people under BMI 30 show signs of poor metabolic health)? And the list goes on and on.",syd_99,1561144259.0,2019-06-21 14:10:59,It's really hard. Counting calories is what triggered me when I was dealing with disordered eating. What I do is I don't necessarily worry about how much I'm eating but what I'm eating. So I still eat till I'm full but I'm eating better foods. And with exercise you should stay away from cardio because that's not making you necessarily healthy but is just burning calories. Try strength training.  Work on your muscles!,syd_99,1561144354.0,2019-06-21 14:12:34,OP isn't necessarily saying they want to lose weight but rather saying they want to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle without relapsing.,Teacupsaucerout,1561144880.0,2019-06-21 14:21:20,"Even if they did not want to lose weight, but mentioned dieting, HAES is relevant. 

Also, as I said, making incremental changes to increase social connectedness, mental health and awareness, eating nutrient dense foods, and increasing activity level is the most effective way to become more “healthy.”",sausagechihuahua,1561146716.0,2019-06-21 14:51:56,"Where you are now is the point where I was when I realized I needed professional help. I have some... uh... mixed opinions about Dr. Phil lol, but there was a really good analogy he made on a show I saw - he had an anorexic girl look at the “end point”, which was a spot that was several yards away. He then blindfolded her , representing her eating disorder. He made her walk blindfolded to the end point - she missed. Then, he had her walk blindfolded to the endpoint guided by a therapist - she made it. It’s not your fault that you’re having trouble. You wouldn’t try to fix a broken leg yourself then get upset that you can’t do it right would you? You need the help of a mental health professional. And that’s nothing to be afraid or ashamed of. Also don’t be fooled into thinking you aren’t “skinny” or “out of control” enough to go - you don’t have to be on your death bed before you seek help.",anniekeepsontrying,1561146935.0,2019-06-21 14:55:35,"I second the comment about HAES. 
Also: Five months recovered is really not very long and you had your ED for 4 years! I’m not questioning your sense of being recovered only you can really judge that. But I’d feel like you need a bit more distance from the whole experience also because it may very well be that your body is still doing internal repair work and your extreme hunger and cravings could be a sign of that so that’s something to consider. 

The weight gain can suck so much but that’s part of recovery acceptance of what your body is. 
For the part of eating “healthy” foods: I believe that the urge to eat more fruits and veggies comes back when the novelty of the play foods wears off. For now though instead of replacing say a candy bar with an apple try just adding it. So candy bar and an apple for example?

Diet culture is basically just a way to call disordered eating “healthy”. Try intuitive eating instead. I’m not too good at explaining shit because I’m still trying to understand it myself BUT! There are a lot of Instagram accounts that talk about intuitive eating and how diet culture is a bunch of BS. I recommend following @ theintuitive_rd or @ dietcultureinc (that ones for fun). I’ve also started listening a pretty okay pod cast as well on Spotify called How to Love Your Body. Scroll through and give some a listen. Hope this halps you like it’s been helping me!

I am 41 years old and in the 3d year of another relapse of anorexia.  I had been in recovery for over 4 years and decided that I needed to lose weight.

I’ve been where you’re at and I’m still trying to work on my lifestyle. 

2 years ago I lost 107 pounds in less than 9 months (19 YO, 6’3” male) I starved my body, counting calories, eating few to many calories (1200 on a “good” day). I’ve kept the weight off but I still have my phases of falling off from the gym and eating like an animal. The biggest advice I can give and how I’ve gotten better is it’s NOT A DIET, you need to try and look at it as a lifestyle change: how you want to be living a normal day no matter your weight. When you trap yourself into the diet mentality you’re going to get mad at yourself for eating out with friends, you’re not going to eat that ONE piece of cake with your significant other. It’s good to have a baseline of how many calories you’re eating and have that understanding but don’t limit yourself to a one day a week cheat meal, if your goal is just to be healthier eat mindfully to the “diet mentality” but try not to stress over 500 calories, even 1000 calories here and there.

With that being said,

I would suggest maybe instead of doing/calling it a diet, just be mindful. Like instead of overthinking what foods to eat, just eat foods that not only make you feel good, but are good for you. Diets never work anyway and I'd be concerned it'll trigger you. Idk how to explain it but if you feel like maybe you're eating too much processed foods/foods that make you feel sluggish and not great, switch it out. Mindfully grocery shop and eat. Make sure you are drinking lots of water and have activities prepared that distract you from negative thoughts. Don't ever feel bad for being hungry or eating something that's considered ""bad"" either. I love mangos, but damn I love Whataburger too (even if they have betrayed the state of Texas smh).

Consider trying it out. It took a few months for it to sink in, for my mind to accept something so against the status quo but I am glad it did. 

As I said, in no way does HAES say that you are not allowed to lose weight or that weight loss is wrong or that it won’t happen while using the HAES approach. It simply says that weight and BMI are not the sole determinant of Health that they’ve been made out to be.",psychandsound,1561178947.0,2019-06-21 23:49:07,"My (For-Now) Unprofessional Perspective:

If you're hoping to lose weight and ""take control over"" what you're eating, and you additionally don't know if you can trust yourself with control over food and exercise yet, I wonder where your intentions for starting a new diet or changing your eating habits are really coming from.

Many people are uncomfortable with weight gain after recovery. It can be hard to accept, but in doing so, many people often grow the most in their recoveries. It's so important to trust that your body weight will eventually settle where it is supposed to be. (A lot of people fear that, in recovery, they will just gain weight and never stop. To my knowledge, this doesn't really happen.) It's even understandable that maybe you've not been seeking out the most ""healthy"" foods. Your body may be craving things it wasn't receiving for a very long time. In my experience, it's important just to trust that eventually the appetite and one's body weight will kind of come to their own equilibriums, and then, recovery won't feel like such an intense rollercoaster.

Trust yourself! Practice your intuitive eating! It's more important right now to master your relationship with food than it is to look or act a certain way. Recovery is so challenging but so beautiful in the end. :) Focus on making this a meaningful experience.",SadTruthsGreatGrowth,1561192063.0,2019-06-22 03:27:43,The only thing that kept me from relapsing...

I am 9 years into recovery and I just started a healthy lifestyle change that does include knowing calories and I struggle with that. But I have been able to remain healthy because.. 9 years. A dietician/ nutritionist needs to be who you speak with. Let them deal with the calories and you follow a meal plan like in the beginning of recovery. It’s really hard to try to figure out healthy lifestyles on your own in ed recovery without it getting obsessive or without your brain making foods “bad.” At least it is for me.

To be honest, it just comes from a place of my own hunger, and also not wanting him to not have enough to eat. I guess I just wouldn't wish it on someone else to starve or be hungry, so I over-serve him often. He never mentions it as a problem but sometimes laughs when I bring him a huge plate. It's only after I see how stuffed he gets that I realize I wayyy overshot the portion size, but I never feel bad about it. I just try gauging his hunger beforehand. I would suggest that maybe you ask to serve yourself once she makes you something, and if it's a touchy subject to talk about portion sizes, just don't mention it and maybe make a point of setting aside leftovers to put in the fridge. My boyfriend started doing that and then I realized I was making too much food, but it wasn't triggering at all.

Thank her, and put what you don't eat in a tupperware for later. I think that's the best thing you can do. Or gently tell her - just be aware you may hurt her feelings, and be ready to explain what a healthy portion for yourself would be. Another idea would be to tell her you'd like a smaller portion, but can always go back for second portions after eating.",Posh_Potat,1561142696.0,2019-06-21 13:44:56,"She might do it because

1. She doesn't want you to be hungry and deprive your body of nutrients. Basically it's her love for you that makes her do it so you don't have to suffer like her. Other people developing an ed is a big fear of mine and I want to do everything to prevent it, it's quite common.
2. It's her ed speaking. Lot of people with restrictive ed's get satisfaction from seeing other people eat more/ more unhealthy foods. You can't blame the person, it's 100% the ed that makes them feel that way. 

I can only speak from my pov. Ed's are diffrent in every person.  Personally the best thing to do is saying you really like the food, but that you are stuffed and are gonna put it in the fridge to eat it later. On the other hand it's also important for people with ed's that they see people eating what they need and take more if they are still hungry or leave some if they are full. So maybe you can just explain your problem to her? One day they are gonna have to go back to eating intuitively too. It can be really triggering though, so it's best to try to find out if she is ready to hear it.",dogggmamamaa,1561159699.0,2019-06-21 18:28:19,I suffer from bulimia and do this for my boyfriend. It’s mainly because he’s a really big muscular guy and I expect him to eat everything I give him... then I get upset when he doesn’t 😂 I don’t think she really means anything by it,throwthediary,1561165943.0,2019-06-21 20:12:23,That’s so thoughtful of you to ask.

I know that helped me better gauge what were appropriate serving sizes for others.,Princess_Medusa,1561184589.0,2019-06-22 01:23:09,"I have this issue with my boyfriend too and it's really difficult to navigate at times. Basically, I mentally just can't eat more than him, so I make sure that he gets a way bigger portion(The issue is that I'm tall and very active as well as never snacking, so quite often, I would need the same size or a bigger portion to maintain my - pretty low, but not dangerously low - weight). There's really no right way to navigate just with actions, because the brain of a person with a eating disorder can change everything into an insecurity.

Because it occured so many times, at some point, I've started talking about it to my boyfriend and one thing that really helps is if he puts things into perspective for me: ""I've had a large breakfast today"", ""I feel stuffed now, but I'll definitely get some more later in the afternoon"" or ""Yesterday when I met friend xy, we still had some beers and pizza, so I'm not that hungry right now"". It really helps to put things into perspective and not make me feel like ""right now I'm eating too much in comparison to him, so I'm a problem"" while everything around the meal tells a completely different story.

You could just carefully try talking about it like: ""This portion is a bit too big for me right now, but I'm just not a person who eats huge meals at once. I also had some snacks earlier/quite a filling lunch/etc."" I'm not sure if she'll feel better when you talk about it, however, I don't think that it's something that bears a strong risk of hurting her, so I'd say that it's worth a try and might even gget her to talk about her mental problems with other people's portion sizes",JessykaLauren,1561186677.0,2019-06-22 01:57:57,"I think the sentence, “mentally just can't eat more than him, so I make sure that he gets a way bigger portion” is so resonating for me.

Just say that you are not used to big portions and that you would rather just have meals that are in a plate where everyone can pick as much as they want until they are full. That might also be beneficial to her because she can't control as much the calories when it's out of a bowl/platter than if it's exactly how much she puts in a plate.

Just don't feel like you have to finish your plate and tell her that you stop eating when you're full. It's also a behaviour she can pick on, it's super important because when you have bulimia you just tend to eat anything and you ignore the feeling of being full.",CheetoFluff,1561219625.0,2019-06-22 11:07:05,"If she’s trying to learn to eat intuitively, I would just make it a “teaching moment.” Like eat what feels like a normal portion, stop when you’re full, tell her you feel full but that you’re going to save what’s left in case you feel hungry later.

(Lower, but not TOO low, even though ED says I felt ""fat"").

Bottom line: I ate at least 5500 cals per day - and my weight evened out at that number as described.

When I first got in for trx, my metabolism shot WAY up - I was burning so much, that the MDs didn't even realize how long it would take me to put on enough weight.

Every body is different, but I'm 45 years old, and this happened to me and to another 46 year old woman. Neither of us are big people by nature, and both of us had to restore a looot of weight.

As an anorexic teenagers myself the most helpful thing my mum does for me is taking me to buy my own food from supermarkets. Your daughter is much more likely to eat if she can select her own safe foods and count the calories in shop bought food rather than eating home cooked meals. The disorder is all about control and, even though this isn’t a sustainable system, giving her as much control over what she eats as possible might encourage her to eat at least some food, rather than nothing at all.

I would go with the therapist recommendation and find a specialist. And maybe search for support for yourself too, this can be a very overwhelming battle.   
Keep reminding her that you love her and you will support her no matter what. Be patient with her, our sickness tries to convince us that we are disgusting and no one loves us.  
Try to avoid comments about weight or calories around her, specially about her, but in general preferably. Instead try to bring the idea of being grateful that our body allows us to be in this wold, that we can do so much things we mostly take for granted, like walking, hearing or seeing.   
Be supporting but not pushing, sometimes with our willing to help we can become too much and be contra productive, how much is too much,  well you will have to find out by listening and asking.   
Safe foods, each of us have a few foods that we feel save to eat at any moment. For me fruits and yogurt for example. Always make sure she has her safe foods available and offer them every time she passes on a meal.   
Get some multivitamins, specially once with B12. Vitamin deficiency can leave permanent damage.

As for what else you can do, let her know you’re there for her always if she needs someone to talk to or needs help.  She needs to know she’s not alone, even though she probably feels that way.

Don't pressure her into stressful situations such as eating cake at a birthday party, just be there for her. Let her know you know this is difficult and it's not about the food, it's about her emotional and physical health. Make sure she knows they're equally important.

Set meal times but choose not scary food like vegetables, salads, protein and legumes etc. Ask her on walks and maybe over time she will open up to you.

The most important thing is to strike the balance between understanding and interfering - it will be the hardest thing you'll ever do but also the greatest display of unconditional love. Make her feel supported and loved and try to make her see that food is not the most important thing in the world. These are all things I know I would have appreciated.

Try to see if you guys can go out and eat, but something healthy. If you expect her to eat a burger with you she will probably lose her shit, get upset, and obviously not eat that burger. Bring more healthy foods and snacks to the house to help her get a healthy relationship with food. If she’s surrounded by a lot of unhealthy and processed foods that she knows has a lot of calories she will not eat it. However if it’s healthy she may eat bits of it but please remember to be slow with her. Do not rush anything bc it may just make her feel worse. Please do not yell at her, be calm and try to be understanding. Go shopping with her maybe but only at a point you see her feeling a bit better and let her know that she looks okay.

I have real issues with how  treatment is done. This is my prefered way to do things.


Dont remove her control! It will freak her out and lead to more extreame behaviours to compensate.


Let her weigh herself - but in the context of normal  fluctuations e.g. food weight,  constipation, dehydration etc. I always weigh the least on a Thursday for a reason. If she doesnt know if shes losing or gaining she may restruct extra to ensure a loss.


Let her know how many calories are in food , even homemade food. It can be a relief to know. 


Teach her about TDEE and NEAT.


Teach her about body composition - how losinv more weight wont get rid of the jiggle but building muscle will. And you need to fuel muscle growth with lots of protein


Teach her how fat, even animal fat is essential for homone function and skin integrity. Fat is better for intestinal transit than fibre.


Fasting is okay, its benefical. Let her fast as long as she refuels properly afterwards ( not binging on sweets and carbs) 


Restriction is an addiction. Treat it that way.


Avoid keeping trigger foods in the house - sweets, bread etc.  Keto is a brilliant way to get rid of binge cravings. She might get a bit hypoglycemic. She should try one or two glucose tablets to ese the feelkng so she can then make better food choices and avoid binging. 


Hypoglycemia was a huge binge trigger for me. Sweets and carbs just make it work. 

 

Remember : she is growing. Her prefrontal cortex is still groeing its cover so her thoughts ate not as rational as an adult, plus she is swimming in hormones. Please stat calm woth her, listen. Reassure her that you love and value her. Dong resort to emotional blackmail. 


There is more i can say here.

Mistakes:
Removing the scale


Sneaking additional calories into food. She will never trust you again, never feel comfortable trusting the calorie counts of food as she wont get the results she expected 

Do not lie to her. Ever. If she is chubby or flabby , acknowledge it.


Do not force her to eat. Maybe offer an alternative. This was a major csuse of my annorexia. My parents tried to force me to eat - it became a battle of wills i was determined to win. And i did. The more they forced the less i ate - just to spite them.

No lower but dont try to force a bmi of 22 as she will over compensate anx go lower than 18 next time",Tishkaminx,1562313311.0,2019-07-05 02:55:11,For me that would be a great idea.

Some of the comments below about giving her more “control” by allowing her to count calories, or teach her about macros, or telling her to eat “healthy” foods, or exercise... probably mean well... but as someone who had an ED for 8 years, that could just transition her from anorexia or bulimia to orthorexia. She could just shift the obsession from restricting to eating “super healthy” and exercising excessively.

Someone who doesn't have as much skin in the game as you do who can talk frankly with her about it. This is pretty common for most mental illnesses - for example, when people tell me to ""just go outside"" to help get over my depression. Unfortunately ignorance is quite common with this sort of thing.

One thing I've found to be effective is to use an analogy that the person has experience with to help them understand. For example, let's say your friend has trouble procrastinating. Maybe she turns papers in late and loses grade points because of it or whatever. You can ask questions like, ""well why don't you just stop doing that? Just turn it in on time."" and then the person gives some reason why it's hard. You can use that reasoning to turn it around on them and help them see why it's not as simple as just being easier on yourself.

One of the biggest struggles people have is trying to understand and empathise with experiences that they have never felt and likely never will. If you can find a way to connect it to something they have felt before, they will be better able to understand what you are going through.",clsquicc,1562270510.0,2019-07-04 15:01:50,"i’ll definitely try talking to her with the analogy thing! thank you so much, i’ll let you know what she says :)",Papa-Storm,1562362247.0,2019-07-05 16:30:47,"Hey, ive had similar experiences to this.

It may be best to hangout in a public setting if you think she’ll blow up at you. But if she does don’t yell at her, yelling always fuels a fire.

It sounds blunt, but it's 100% true and better to let go of the fantasy that being sick will get you care/interest/affection. As a child, maybe it would have, but as adults, I've watched my own life and my sister's life spiral quickly into the opposite direction/truth. People have their own stress and lives to battle. They want/need partners in life, equals and friends who can help THEM, not that look sick and seemingly need attention and validation from them/everyone else. I've had to learn this by distancing myself from constant caregiver role. It's not my responsibility to love anyone but myself, and through genuine care towards ME, I can share with others whom I select and who cherish me and are not bottomless pits of need. Those people need themselves, just like I had to learn to need ME, and not everyone else's opinion of and validation of me. I had to let go of the idea that being sick would give me anything, because in reality, in the real ass world, it just took from me. No one wanted to deal with shit I wouldn't stop doing to myself. It was not even in their power in the first place, when it came down to it. The ED wants and will never give back. You will never feel sick enough for whatever it is that you're seeking, and even if you did, you still would not get the love and care you need by being sick and fractured. I watched my sister scream at everyone around her and almost die, while repeating that no one was really there for her, no one understood, no one truly cared. My parents paid for so many surgeries, so much hospitalization, tried to do anything they could but they and no one else are perfect, and she would never be happy because ultimately the problem was in how she saw herself and the rest of the world, in her head. The mirror and the clothing size does not change psychological processes. Those are their own beast to tackle. The mirror is a lie, a quickfix, a complete distraction and an easier one at that. I would to eat lettuce and suddenly not have anxiety or depression, but that's not how it works.

Other people can only do so much, say so much, and we will never be content or happy if other people are the mirrors through which we identify. You should put on weight so people won't feel alienated around you, so you can be with people who can love you without barriers, so you can be alive and cognitive and feel what people have to give you, and anyone who compares a healthier you to an emaciated you, is most likely relieved that they can treat you like a normal person and not worry that you're going to pass out or die on them. Eating is a social thing, not just for BMI and clothing sizes. And honestly, I have no idea what you look like and yet I still wanted to talk with you. So, your size is irrelevant to me, a person. This is true for many people, behind screens or IRL. You have to rely on who you are as a person and not the skin post you shape to hide behind, to try and control other people's feelings/responses. You do not get to control what other people think or how they think or what they see/feel. Focus on you and what makes YOU happy, genuinely, and you won't care how anyone views your laugh, smile, arm, jaw. No one is even looking at those things, unless they are vapid and shallow and are also pointed toward toxicity and need a huge psychological remapping. Most people are listening to your face, not judging the measurements. They're judging your words and how you follow through with them. Most people don't give a single fuck what pant size you are, they care where you've carried yourself and what you stand for. If the only thing we care about is calories and pantsize... no one is going to have much to say to you. There's nothing to relate to there, unless that person also is so focused on themselves that they can't spare a real thought for you.

We have to stay out of our own heads. Be there for the mental and emotional union between you and other people and you will find you have less of a paranoid cycle of thoughts about yourself. Because it's not about your weight. It never was. It's about acceptance, vulnerability, strength in uncertainty, and patience. Just try to focus on the bigger picture, pun intended. You need to be here to have a good time here. And you can. We all can.

Even though I still had a few more pounds of weight on me than my skinny friends, even though I didn't look like a model, I was fitter than I'd ever been! I could climb a flight of stairs without having to pant heavily like my skinny friends did. I was generally eating better - enjoying and sometimes even craving fruits and veggies over processed foods.  I could lift heavier than I'd ever had. I was getting compliments from guys at the gym for being one of the only women to show enough interest and be serious enough about lifting weights. 
So don't forget that you taking care of your body and being fit can be measured in different ways. 

My suggestion would be that you stop restricting yourself when it comes to food. Focus instead on getting this mental pressure off you first. This constant mental nagging of ""I'm fat"" and ""I need to lose weight"" needs to be decreased if not stopped entirely. School is more important, focus on that instead. For now, at least. I'm not saying you should give up on being fit or losing weight again.  In general, focus on other aspects of your life for a while. Distract yourself. Take up a new activity - doesn't necessarily have to be physically taxing. Learn a new skill. 

Just do things to keep reminding yourself that there's more to you than your body. Just generally, gradually, try to make healthier choices. Eat more veggies. Drink more water. Walk to the store, take the stairs. I do still say don't restrict yourself to the point where you're putting immense pressure on yourself when deciding what to eat and then feeling guilty afterwards if you overeat. 
Do all this, just for a while, to get that pressure and stress off you. Then after that period is over, assess yourself. Assess things you've accomplished in life. And tackle weight loss just like you'd tackle any other task thrown at you. Start fresh and start with a plan. 

And Don't. Give. Up. 

Keep trying each time you feel you've gone off the road. Please don't be afraid of failure. I feel like a lot of the things that are ""worth it"" in life will show you the face of failure and you'll always learn something from it. And don't worry about it, if you're someone like me who enjoyed the gym and working out, you will find your way back. 


I hope this helps! And take care. I'm obviously not a specialist who can provide medical advise. However, if you really feel it's messing with your head -the restricting and constant binging - and you just generally feel like you're not in control anymore, it might not be a bad idea to seek professional help! The earlier you get it, the better imo.",canute_the_viking,1561998242.0,2019-07-01 11:24:02,"&gt;But I honestly hate tracking calories. It makes me food obsessive, and I get mad feeling like I have to restrict so much.

This is quite common.  It is important to be aware of approximately how many calories you are consuming, but the restrictions you are placing on yourself are obviously having a negative effect.

A couple of things to try:

-Keep MFP as a reference to check something, but don't track everything you eat.  I'm sure you are roughly aware of foods that are high in calories, but there may also be some that surprise you.  Same goes for portion size.  Do you *really* know what 100g of pasta looks like or are you under/over-estimating.  You can use MFP to check things you are unsure of from time to time, but the overall goal is to *choose* meals that are 'low-ish' in calories more than you choose meals that are 'high-ish' in calories.  I've used the word 'meals' rather than 'foods' deliberately.  It's the overall intake that matters, rather than any one item of food.

-If/when you do feel ready to track, track over a week rather than a day.  You might be surprised at how frequently you can indulge a little when you have 6 more days to make up the difference.

-This is the big one: Don't be too restrictive! You have identified yourself that your binges are a response to stress and part of that could be the stress you are putting on yourself.

&gt;I probably told myself a 10000 times, “OK. diet starts tomorrow and i’ll track calories again.” 

-If this hasn't worked, just stop doing it.  Maybe try ""The diet will start at some point, but I'm not sure when that is yet"".  I know that isn't what you want to tell yourself, but it may help reduce the pressure you are piling upon yourself.

Those are just some ideas that may or may not work for you that your post suggests you may not have tried yet.  There is no silver bullet here - it is a question of trying different things until you find something that works for you and that may be completely different to what worked for others.  The important thing is that you keep trying and don't give up.  People in your situation can and do develop healthy relationships with food.

Finally, I would advise you to focus on how you can reduce stress elsewhere in your life.  Perhaps make a list of 3 things that stress you out that aren't food or body related and think about how you can reduce some of that stress.

I wish you the best of luck and would like to reiterate the most important thing: Don't give up.",meghnards,1562007291.0,2019-07-01 13:54:51,"I've been in this cycle off and on for around 15 years and it sucks. I'm sorry you're experiencing this, but I am also so glad you realize that having a good relationship with food is a goal worthy of pursuing, and I hope you'll come to see that it's more important in the long run than having a certain body shape. It's taken me a lot of therapy, reading self-help books, etc to get to the point where I genuinely love my body most of the time and feel I can enjoy food while maintaining a weight I am comfortable at. Here are the strategies that have helped me the most:

\- If you are not already in therapy, I highly recommend it. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in particular can help you reprogram your thought patterns about yourself, and in the end, changing perspective is everything. Even just one session a month can work wonders. If this isn't an option for whatever reason, look up Woebot on Facebook - it's basically a CBT bot that messages you with daily checkups, guided writing prompts, and suggestions for changing unhealthy thoughts. I know it sounds silly but this thing helped pull me out of my worst relapse I've had as an adult and I will never stop recommending it to people. 

\- I never, EVER track my calories/macros/whatever. This can only end one of two ways: 1) I get obsessive and relapse, or 2) I resist the relapse, feel super deprived/stressed from focusing too much on the counting, and start to binge. This is something that took me a lot of time to accept... Some people can count calories and track their intake without losing their minds, but I am simply not one of them. Same thing goes for countless other dieting strategies. It can be tempting to talk yourself into believing that you can go down that road, lose the weight, and be just fine, but until you have a truly healthy relationship with your body and food, it just isn't possible, and that's okay. **Life is too short to reduce one of the most pleasurable activities we have to a tedious, stressful math problem.** 

\- This is maybe the most important one: I stopped trying to approach my health/weight in terms of deprivation. I can't tell you how many times I've told myself, ""I'm going to stop eating sugar/bread/processed food/fat because they're bad for me,"" but in the back of my mind I really just wanted to lose weight. EDs are insidious and learning how to identify this ulterior motive and veto it has been essential for my recovery. Instead, try to think in terms of what you can **add** to your life that will make you healthier and happier, and the feelings you will have that have nothing to do with weight. For instance, right now I try to eat fresh fruit and vegetables that I genuinely enjoy with every meal/snack, which helps my skin, energy, and satiation, so I'm less likely to binge and I simply don't have as much room in my stomach for the foods that make me feel bad. 

\- As for the gym: I go because I genuinely enjoy it, just like you did at the beginning. Reducing your motivation to ""weight loss"" will KILL this intrinsic joy and make it something you dread, the same way that paying someone to do their hobby often has the same effect (which is why I don't draw commissions anymore!). When I find myself thinking ""I should go to the gym because I feel fat,"" which usually incurs a feeling of dread and guilt,"" I try to replace it with ""I **love** going to the gym because it makes me feel happy and strong."" It's so much easier to build the habit on a positive motivation than a negative one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway sorry for the wall of text! Learning how to prioritize my self love and my relationship with food has been instrumental for living a (mostly) healthy, productive, fulfilling life, which will always take precedence over being a certain weight.

What helped me stop right after recovery (6months no purging) is going vegan and doing a raw till five. That helped speed my metabolism, and helped me feel fresh. It decreased my need to purge. 
Another good idea is to track your macros, work out and aim to gain muscle. Try RP, they have diets for different goals and they have an app that tracks your macros. Great app, but $15 a month, worth the money. Stay away anything related to losing fat for now. Now is all about staying healthy.

I know how stressful and anxious having all these unwanted and unwarranted eating/ food/ body image thoughts can get. At times like this, it may really help to seek professional help: a therapist or dietician that specializes in ED. A quicker alternative is an app called Youper, which is an emotional health assistant. 

When you find yourself always thinking about food and eating, that could be a sign that you’re mentally and/or physically hungry. In that case, it would be beneficial to just eat. Eat to your heart’s content, until you’re satisfied and full (there is a difference between the two and they’re both important). Recovery eating isn’t pretty, and there will be side effects to expect such as possible weight gain or digestion issues, but it’s necessary to get out of the disordered pattern. Eventually your body and hunger will begin to regulate itself again and you won’t think about food all the time. 

Having a constant mindset of dieting may force you to make up certain rules and guidelines for your eating, thus creating a sense of restriction or actual restriction. If your diets are doing this, it may make you think about food or be hungry all the time because your body is in a state of (mental) hunger and starvation. Most diets also don’t last long, which can lead to feelings of resentful or failure. An alternative method is to find a diet that doesn’t force you to have all these eating rules, and to find one that is is sustainable. Make it something that’s filling and enjoyable for you.",PM_Me_Your_F00t,1562949351.0,2019-07-12 11:35:51,"You're definitely not alone. I cant imagine how mentally exhausted you must be by now.

It’s not easy at all, and in fact recovery can be such an up and down, non-linear process. But you chose it! And being healthy is what matters and I’m glad you have both a nutritionist and psychologist working with you.

Your parents/close friends/whomever cares for you and has been with you before &amp; after this process will (understandably) be concerned and a bit untrusting when it comes to diet changes and such at this time. Unfortunately it’s really annoying when you are the one they are worrying about, but know it comes from a good place (I assume, unless she’s overly controlling/etc, which then that’s another convo). They are just afraid that you’ll go back to your disordered eating habits and being less trusting is the only way they seem to know how to cope with it. It can honestly feel like sometimes it’d be easier to just go back because at that point at least their suspicion is founded, but of course that’s not true. Some things I might suggest to help: perhaps your mom should look into therapy as well (separately from you). If she’s feeling worried she may want to have someone (preferably someone well versed in EDs) to discuss the process of recovery as a parent. Also, if you have that kind of relationship sometimes it can help to just be very open and honest with her about your feelings and how you’re feeling about food. Perhaps sharing excitement over certain meals or certain milestones in your recovery process. This could help her “trust you”. 

Side note: I also drink a gallon of water a day and have been since being in recovery (though ED me drank almost that amount too). It’s perfectly healthy and I find after the initial adjustment period my body was still as hungry as when I didn’t drink as much water. 

At the end of the day, if she still doesn’t have trust in you, I am sorry because it sucks and I’ve been there. You just have to remind yourself that the only person in charge of recovering is you. It doesn’t matter what other people say, if you know you want to recover and are actively choosing it then you know that. Lastly, perhaps you could ask your psychologist good ways to combat certain suspicions.

796,cc4jut,backstrokerjc,1562902173.0,2019-07-11 22:29:33,"I can share my story! 

I developed an ED 8 years ago (almost exactly). My pediatrician caught on when I had my yearly physical, so I've been in recovery for about 7 and a half years, and for the past ~4 years I would consider myself recovered (no desire at all to engage in any ED behaviour, no distress about my weight). 

Early on I went to a lot of specialists--therapists, psychiatrists, nutritionists--and it took a while and several different people to find what at least halfway worked for me. With this sort of thing, finding a therapist/psychiatrist is like dating: you have to click and be able to trust the person for it to work out. So if this psychiatrist just doesn't work for you, don't worry. Just try someone else. 

In the beginning the nutritionist was the most helpful. I needed to not be in starvation mode in order to work on any of the underlying issues, and she helped me get through the initial months of being terrified of eating. She had a way of making it fun (as much as it could be), and of explaining things in a way that registered with me.

I later found a therapist who specializes in ED treatment because he had had an ED himself. He really helped me start to look at the feelings behind my disorder. 

But, at the risk of sounding too simplistic, what really was instrumental in my recovery was finding a group of friends at college, by joining the marching band. I heard a saying somewhere that addiction is the opposite of connection, and I really felt that in my recovery. I had friends who liked me, not for how athletic or skinny I was but for *me*, and I had so much genuine fun with them that the disordered thoughts started to slowly fade into the background until I realized that it had been a week since I'd obsessively counted calories, a month since i thought about weighing myself, that I could go to restaurants and not have a panic attack. I had something else to live for besides my disorder and the need to fulfil every arbitrary criterion for success it laid out. 

It will not happen the same way for you--everyone has a unique disorder and a unique story. But it is possible, possible to have a life without this shadow blanketing everything you think and do. Keep that in mind as you start your recovery, on the days where you don't think there will ever be an end, ever be a day when you're free of this. There can be. There will be. 

And please, message me if you need to chat.",smokeyhuskys,1562904373.0,2019-07-11 23:06:13,"I grew up in an abusive household so I turned to anorexia for control over something in my life. 

I remember I would weigh myself multiple times a day and if I ate at all would obsess over it; I shit you not food was probably the only thing I thought about. I couldn't get up without fainting, always freezing, almost dying when I was sick, and spending hours stuck in a waking nightmare: not enough energy to even cry.

I started ending up in the ER and psychiatric units for suicide attempts. With therapy I got the strength to cut my mom out of my life. From there, I only continued to cut the people that hurt me out of my life (yes, this includes my anorexic friends that did not want to recover).

Wouldn't say I'm 100% recovered, but in all honesty doing so much better. I started with a dietitian because I needed someone else to tell me what to eat then from there I got tired of the rigidness and some recovery channels like megsy on YouTube started to speak to me, so I started intuitive eating and I LOVE IT.

It's all a mental battle. Getting into a cycle of restricting and binging is a common characteristic of eating disorders.

Eating disorders are behavior-based mental health disorders, where the behaviors are used as unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with an underlying issue (similar to addiction). Try to talk to a therapist or even a friend about this, it may help you start to get out of your own head and rationalize why you are choosing to cope this way.  Best of luck to you!!

806,ca7sh3,cthaven,1562512980.0,2019-07-07 10:23:00,"Might be stupid advice, but if you’re not working with a therapist I would definitely do that.",Toast_in_the_Toaster,1562527997.0,2019-07-07 14:33:17,"I can kinda relate to this in a way. My eating disorder started with me trying to eat healthier and exercise more. My BF at the time started to notice that what I was doing wasn't healthy and suggested I see a therapist. When my therapist told me that I have an eating disorder I felt like things spiralled. I started critiquing myself harshly and I hated parts of my body I didn't think I originally had a problem with. And I started hiding my behaviors because I didn't want anyone pointing it out. These unhealthy behaviors were already there and being ""diagnosed"" planted these terrible thoughts in my head and I began acting on them. 

As for advice, I think the best thing to do is to lean on your support system (your GF) and be open about how you are feeling about your body. Tell her that you feel like you need to avoid people so she can help you actively combat these thoughts. To help you perform an ""opposite action"" to the thoughts in your head. 

Definitely consult a therapist. A dietitian will help with a meal plan, but there are clearly a lot of emotions playing into this and a therapist can help you with this aspect of things. 

It isn't going to be easy to ""get past this"". It'll take work but I promise you it's worth it. Your feelings are valid and understandable. But it's important to note that these negative feelings you have towards your body are mostly likely a manifestation of your stress and depression. Depression and anxiety are hard to deal with and they don't have easy solutions. That's why eating disorders develop; they feel like something you CAN control to make yourself feel better but it doesn't actually work in the long term. 

Get help, find someone you trust to talk to. This isn't something that'll just fix itself and it's near impossible to do it alone. It is not weak to ask for help. You are not a burden to others by asking for help. Your health and happiness is important and you need to fight for these things. You deserve these things.

And remember this: stomaches aren't meant to be flat, your stomach houses all your organs and fat protects these organs. Arms are supposed to jiggle, they have muscles in them. When you look down, the skin on your neck and chin are meant to roll, if it didn't, then you wouldn't have the appropriate range of motion in your neck. Society demonizes ""fat"" but without it, you couldn't survive. Our bodies are smart. They know what they need to survive. Trust your body. Give it fuel. As long as you are getting the right nutrients for your body, it will find a healthy weight and shape on its own.",ElegantAsh,1562528039.0,2019-07-07 14:33:59,Unfortunately she only knows that I use to SH.

She is going through more than her far share of anxiety and depression, and lately a lot of that has been because of me. She is still processing the fact that I’m beginning my transition, and that many of the plans we had for our life arnt going to go exactly as planned. 

Unfortunately I use to be a health nut in high school. I put everything I had into my image because I hated it so much. I worked out and ate beyond healthy. Because of my body type (I thing it was ectomorph?) I couldn’t gain fat even if I wanted to, but with working out, and being as active as I was, I was eating around 5000 calories a day. Now that my metabolism has slowed, and I've gained any new fat because of the hormones, my head constantly screams at me that I'm overweight (165pounds 5’11”)",Toast_in_the_Toaster,1562530814.0,2019-07-07 15:20:14,"I totally get where you are coming from with your GF. I don't know how your relationship is with her, but speaking from my own experience, if my S/O was going through something I'd be devastated to find out they didn't tell me what was going on. Regardless of how stressed I am, I want to know if something is wrong because I love this person. Relationships are partnerships and we support each other. I'm not saying you should expect your GF to solve the problem, but just having someone to talk to who truly cares can do wonders for your mental health. It can be incredibly lonesome to internalize all these feelings. 

If the roles were reversed, would you want her to tell you these things? 

And I can't imagine how hard it must be dealing with these thoughts while your body is undergoing all these changes. I wish I had more solid advice regarding your specific situation but unfortunately I don't. My best advice is to seek a therapist who specializes in eating disorders/transgender. Therapy really helped me start to distill my thoughts and recognize the ones that were eating disorder related.

I agree that sometimes veganism can help you move away from certain kinds of old restriction/ED behaviours because that itch is scratched by a new set of rules. Rules that used to exist around weight gain/junk food, etc are less or not important, and now making sure any/all things that enter you are vegan or mostly vegan is a new stringent rule. Another term for this is symptom swapping.

Not that this is necessarily the case for you! Just putting in my two cents. I caught myself getting sucked into it myself. It gave me power over food in a way because I think trying to switch to a more ethical diet almost made it easier to forgive or allow myself to gain weight or eat certain foods I didn’t use to allow myself to have. I still choose meat substitutes when I can, but I recognize that despite the legitimate ethical reasons for doing it, it’s not something I can be allowed to do at this point in my life in any strict capacity. It’s good to learn to forgive yourself for eating ‘junk’ or gaining weight, but using something external like veganism is avoiding the real issue imo. 

This is especially true if it’s making you feel guilty whenever you consume animal products. I get that it’s hard on your GI tract to eat animal protein when you haven’t for a while and I get that factory farming is a terrible industry, and I get that killing and eating animals is terrible. But at this point, your health is more important and it sounds like you need a bit more psychological flexibility around consuming animal products. Something between strict veganism and never choosing meat alternatives maybe? 

Also it might be worth considering that maybe denying yourself animal product foods that you enjoyed before could be the cause of you reaching for them when you’re feeling bad, not necessarily to punish yourself. It’s not unlike having a spike in cravings for calorie dense foods during a diet where you’re not supposed to eat certain calorie dense food. Eventually when you do break and eat them, the shame and guilt is overwhelming and feels intuitively like you’ve done something wrong, (but of course you haven’t). To crave and reach for foods we’ve disallowed ourselves is completely healthy and normal, not your body or mind trying to punish you necessarily.",curiouslysolved,1562625572.0,2019-07-08 17:39:32,"veganism helped me for sure. i suffered with an eating disorder in my second and third year of university, where calories turned into a numbers game and it was always about seeing how low i could get them while still feeling okay. veganism made me look at food as serving a higher purpose - it's not evil, and eating this food is saving animals, educing your effect on the environment etc. but every now and again if you crave something that isnt vegan, just eat it. the vegan community is meant to encourage more plant based consumption, not shame people. you've restricted yourself for so long, enjoy the feeling of letting go and don't place so much importance on food. everything in moderation! you're doing so well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not ok to purge even if we are stress, that is a warning sing, and that is not a fully recovered case. It is not your responsibility, sure, but that issue is clearly not under control and she is delusional to think so. Throwing up causes serious medical issues, that are not to ignore.  


I suggest keep trying to find her a therapist. Maybe you can make a list of places for her to call (a ED specialist would be best) and offer to take her and wait for her. It is scary the first time. But is true if you push too much it can be unhelpful.",someone52207,1563534766.0,2019-07-19 06:12:46,"There are 3 reasons why someone would be throwing up that often:

1. Medication or health condition making her sick- she needs to see a doctor to get that straightened out.

2. Anxiety so high she's getting sick- if anxiety gets to be bad enough that you're throwing up regularly, you definitely need to talk to a therapist and doctor. 

3. Eating disorder- she has a history of one, so this is most likely what's happening. You start off thinking it will only be this one time to help you cope because it was a bad day. Then it gets worse and next thing you know you're in full on relapse. If that's the case and she is/was serious about recovering she definitely needs to talk to a therapist and doctor. 

There is no reason to be throwing up that often. If this is a recent relapse, it's best to address it before it becomes more ingrained. You should be worried. 

Please address it carefully though. Come from a place of concern and try not to sound accusatory. You can suggest seeing someone and offer to help her find some help, but don't force it or make ultimatums. Remind her that you care about her wellbeing and that you just want to see her healthy and happy. 

Also don't force her to stop or be a nazi patrolman about her puking. That will mean she'll become even more secretive and/or stop seeking you for help or disclosing it with you. You can be clear that you don't like seeing her suffer, but she needs to find another healthy coping skill before this one is stolen away.",MedievalShrimp,1563546669.0,2019-07-19 09:31:09,"Support her in positive ways and encourage her to seek help.

It is very important that you let someone know what you are going through. I dont know your support situation, but if you have any close friends or relatives that you trust, i would start by letting them know you are having a rough time. They might not be able to help much, but i have found that taking that first step is often the hardest (because you want to keep spiraling, i know, it feels better that way). But you have to find a way to slowly mend your emotions and thoughts again, like you have in the past. 

Please don’t give up. I know doctors at times can be no help or even make things worse. The only way i found recovery is by cutting out all doctors altogether and focusing on my true wants to get better and to live a better life. I couldn’t have done it without my boyfriend though, who i trust with my life and can tell everything to.

When your body realizes it can have food, the bingeing will slowly stop. But for now your body is in recovery so go out and get some new comfy clothes u like for your recovery body!

Now I live alone so it’s a lot more difficult, but whenever I feel like I want to binge I’ve learned it helps to just step away. Go run an errand, walk the dog. Put some distance between yourself and the pull of eating. 

That said, it is a normal part of recovery, so know it’s just your body finally asking for the nutrients it needs. It will lessen over time.

I can relate to your struggles with eating and body dysmorphia, though I have never lost weight (have always been very heavy, despite my ED). But all is not lost. From your description, it seems you have two separate things to tackle.

 1st, your ED. You say that eating meals makes you feel suicidal. Please don't kill yourself. Your ED can be managed; it is not worth your life. Do you have safe foods? For me, those are foods that I can eat without being consumed with the desire to purge. Fruits like bananas, hard-boiled eggs, and green juices are my safe foods. If you have safe foods, give yourself permission to eat them and only them. If you're in the middle of b/p cycle, having a safe food might help you steady yourself and get in control. I understand totally how hard it is to resist the desire to b/p. Safe foods might help. 

 It is an enormous amount of effort and labor to acknowledge that you are out of control. You should give yourself some credit for that. 

As to your loose skin problems, I'm afraid I don't have any comfort or advice. I hope that your appointment gives you good news, and remember that even if you can't get the surgery right now, the surgery isn't something that will expire. Your doctor can hopefully give you a clearer idea of what needs to be done in order for that surgery to take place. If that surgery is something that is necessary for your mental health, then you need to demand that it take place, even if you need to complete steps to make it happen. 

I'll be thinking of you. Please take care of yourself.",Tishkaminx,1563347776.0,2019-07-17 02:16:16,"You need to eat to repair the skin. You shpuld focus on collagen rich foods and take a good collagen supplement. This regime also works for cellulite which im plagued with and has massively improved with collagen. 

I take 6 hydrolysed collagen tablets a day plus eat pork rinds and bone broth made into low calorie veg soup. (All hkne made - save bones avnd cook all day on a slow cooker/ crock pot).
U
I use a body derma roller too to stimulate collagen production. It really works. 

Dont forget to eat lots of protein too, but not lean. You need fat to lubticate your skkn and regulate hormones. It will help with stretch marks and repair . 

So eat- fat, protein, collagen. 

I ditch the carbs as my body can easily synthesise what carbs it needs from fat and protein and carbs just make me bingy.

The other thing that actually works is Palmers massage cream for stretch marks. The thick one in the tube. I swear it works wonders.  It has collagen and elastin. I use a bit under my eyes and nasolabial folds too. (Nose to mouth lines)",Ligeia09,1563421777.0,2019-07-17 22:49:37,"First thing to adress is the suicidal thoughts. Depression is very serious and you need professional help. You will never be satisfied with your body if your mind doesn't get better and you know that.

Not eating enough can make anyone unstable. It is literally used as torture to deprive someone of food. You need to learn how to eat in a way to feed your body the necessary nutrients to function properly and you also need to enjoy the food you eat. It doesn't matter if you are underweight or overweight,eating is not an option but an obligation.

Eat a rainbow everyday. Fruits and veggies,lean protein like chicken and fish. Eggs and whole grains. Healthy fats for cooking such as extra virgin olive oil or avocado in a salad or on a whole grain toast. There's no such thing as dangerous or safe food,this idea is only feeding the disorder. Junk food is not real food so that doesn't count. Real whole food is super food and it will make you feel better in the long term.  

You might not like the way your body looks like right now but you still have to treat it right because that's the only one you got and it's keeping you alive and taking you wherever you want. Take warm bath with fresh flowers,bubble bath,rub it with lotion. Take care of yourself. 

I know you want the skin surgery but if your heart is not strong enough because you push it to the limit by not eating and exercising too much you will not be approoved ! Because you'll die on the table. Make your heart strong so you can achieve that. IF there's still too much fat for it don't take it as a failure but take it as an occasion to take care of your health. Your internal organs and your mind too. If you don't get it now you'll get it later don't worry.

Trust me i know this isn't easy but everything is linked together. Mind and body work together.I went through it,i went from obese to healthy thin and active doing that and it was miraculous for my bipolar disorder too (depression,suicidal etc). 

You can keep going like this and you don't want too either because you have goals (skin surgery is only one of them) so you want to get better and you will ! 

I wish you the best of luck and don't forget to take care of yourself ! Mind and body :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-If you are able to, talk to a professional. 
-I know it’s cheesy, but self help books can a great tool. They could help sort out your head. 
-There is almost definitely something deeper going on that addressing might make recovery easier. 
-Maybe find a buddy that is understanding, but helps hold you accountable for what you eat. 
-If you have a pet, try scheduling feeding times for them as a time that you eat something. 

I know it can be really alluring to seek out pro-ed content. I’d almost classify it as a form of digital self harm. You know it’s not good for you, but you don’t care. It’s not pushing you to be anything better, it’s a tool to trick the brain into becoming sicker. If you look at those images too long, they become the new normal and everything starts to look too big. But those images are not normal. The culture surrounding them is not normal. 

When I would look at that content I would think to myself, “It should be so easy to look like that. If it’s just not eating, why don’t I look like that? I’m not eating so why am I stuck like this.” I didn’t realize that I was starting to look like that, and not in a glamorous way. I lost hair, bruised constantly, felt like crying in public, and sometimes couldn’t make it up the steps to my apartment yet still felt too big. Down this road there is never a ‘small enough’. Your brain just keeps moving what the goalpost of what is normal. Once I started fueling my body correctly it helped my mind to change too. 

When you are striving towards something so vigorously to the point where your life revolves around it everything is warped. For you, things are still warped. You can’t be happy like this. Nobody is. You’ve already accepted that you have a problem, now you just need to decide what you’ll do from here.

A good body is a healthy body. Reminding me to use my coping mechanisms. All those things therapy tried to teach lol. 

If the relationship is new and you don’t want to her then involved quite yet, I would just continue to focus on what you’ve learned. When you’re in a good place, write a letter to yourself in the bad place to remind yourself how to cope. Keep it in your pocket.  Another trick for anxiety for me is being ultra observant of the things around me. Like the lamp on the table. The type of tAable cloth. You can kinda try to push the anxious though away by distracting yourself while thinking. And my final thing is r arranging food into sections to eat.

It is fantastic and I would highly recommend it.,EDReferral,1563391667.0,2019-07-17 14:27:47,"It’s the beginning of 2016, and living a sober, healthier life is at the top of thousands of New Year’s resolutions lists. It’s a good place to begin improving your life—drugs and alcohol have a tendency to complicate life rather than solve your problems. No matter the reason behind your decision to lead a sober life, here are 5 ways to jumpstart your recovery!

1. **Be Honest About Your Motives:** Deciding to live sober is always a good decision, but you still need to understand why. If there are deeper causes for your addiction, such as emotional trauma or mental disorders, these things need to be addressed before you can experience true and profound healing.
2. **Do Your Research Before Committing To A Rehab Center**: Don’t get me wrong—you should absolutely go to rehab. The devoted teams of compassionate addiction recovery professionals are there for one reason: to help facilitate your all-around healing.
3. **Create Lists:** A great way to stay on target with your goals in any aspect of your life is to sit down and record what you want to accomplish. Making lists of your goals makes them more tangible and real instead of just dreaming of them, turn your wants into short- and long-term goals.
4. **Be Open About Your Journey:** Speaking openly about your quest for sobriety is important to your success for two reasons: it helps you put things in perspective and it keeps you on track. Not only does this help nurture your new, healthier coping and communication skills, but it can also help strengthen bonds with the people supporting you throughout your recovery.
5. [Read Success Stories](https://www.edreferral.com/blog)**:** When it comes to sober living, we often allow doubt and fear to stand in the way. We convince ourselves we simply aren’t strong enough, that sobriety after battling addiction is some one-in-a-million thing. That’s simply not true—thousands of people every day commit to sober living with incredible success. No matter your age or length of substance dependency, so long as you are still breathing, you have the chance to turn everything around. Draw inspiration from those who have walked the sober path before you: some of your favorite musicians, actors, and TV personalities have achieved sobriety after struggling with drugs and alcohol.",harryjamespotter7,1563933721.0,2019-07-23 21:02:01,"Life without Ed and Goodbye Ed, Hello Me are so good!!!",julesD00,1563998686.0,2019-07-24 15:04:46,[A Guide To Recovery](https://www.amazon.com/Bulimia-Guide-Recovery-Lindsey-Hall/dp/0936077514) saved my life 6 years ago!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

830,cdhmt2,sorryikeepfarting,1563206334.0,2019-07-15 10:58:54,"Hi! I'm really sorry that you are going through this stressful time, but your sister is lucky because she has you who cares so much for her and having the support from a family member even if just one is an important factor to recovery! 

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if your sister knows or agrees that she has an eating disorder? 

It seems like family dimensions are though, eating disorders usually like for myself stem from a need to control something that seems uncontrollable. If there is a lot of family issues or social struggles she has maybe that is why she is stressed out and takes it out on herself to occupy her mind of other ongoing issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

You said she doesn't like that you worry about her, I take this as your sister has guilt about the stress she is causing your family (as your dad puts it) so seeing you worried only reinstates the negative emotions she has about herself. You could maybe put it somewhere along the lines  of:

&amp;#x200B;

*""How you starve yourself is awful for YOUR body and mental health, not MINE. What I do worry about is how this will affect you on the long run, and it upsets me because I see so much potential and possibility from you, and how incredible and different life will get for you because how you feel today, in this house, in this state is not forever. Life always changes and moves forward and you have the opportunity to mold it to how you please, you have more power than you believe but your power right now is invested in the wrong things. You are sad and you cry not because you have given up, but because you know there could be better and that you deserve better. But better is not starving oneself and harming ones own body, it is acknowledging that you deserve better than the situations that have brought you to this.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

My friend said that to me once and it really opened my eyes on the situations which brought me to hating my self and by association, my own body. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of family I do not know if you are comfortable talking to your dad, but I think he needs to understand that yelling at someone is not going to change what they are doing. And whether he believes that it is ""real"" or not will not change the fact that it is still happening. He needs to understand that is he does not have any useful things to tell her that wont destroy her spirits even more, than he needs to stay silent and reflect on how his own actions may be fuelling her stress, because she is also a human being and also experiences stress and depression- he is not the only person in the world who has experienced pain to different degrees. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of binge eating, thats what we would see as our ""weak"" moments, but actually it was one of the strongest I think, because I allowed myself to eat and it is a reflection of how desperately we actually need it. When she binges maybe do something with her that allows her to leave the house and take her mind off of things. I would suggest maybe going on a walk, sitting somewhere to listen to music and try to keep it light and playful. Our eating disorders are a constant in our minds, to constantly remind her of it would only fuel the obsession, in stressful situations that occur after a binge try to take her mind off of it and do something with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if youve ever talked about your own depression or struggles with weight with her, but i often found it easier to open up to someone who i thought had similar feelings as I did, maybe sharing experiences will help her feel less alone and isolated too?

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to know if you can talk to her therapist and let them know of this issue, and maybe they have advice on how to comfort her at home and you two can figure out ways where support is constant and she knows that when she is ready she has her team and her sister who will always be there for her!

&amp;#x200B;

She told me that it all started when her depression started to get worse. She lost hope for her future, that was the only thing keeping herself together and then she collapse. Her only objective now is losing weight.

About my dad... It's quite hard to talk with him. I specially don't have a good relationship with him. He never listen to anyone, not even mom. He promised to not tell anything but that happened... What we are doing now is just faking that everything is okay.

Additionally maybe you can tell them you're scared of falling back into old habits and ask them to stop buying a few things that you don't want around you.

I know you don’t want to scare your parents or cause them any distress, but if they’re already aware of your past history, it’s something they’ll be worrying about anyway. You’ll actually do a lot to assuage their fears by coming to them, explaining gently what’s going on, and what they can do to help you. They’ll appreciate your maturity in recognising the issue and identifying steps you need to take and being open and honest with them. That way they’ll understand the why behind your grocery requests, rather than it leading to uncomfortable questions that could have the potential to put all of you in a tense situation where everybody is second guessing each other, and they’ll know it’s not just you being ‘fussy’. I’m sure they love you and just want the best for you, and while it’s extremely hard to open up about this kind of thing, it’ll benefit you all in the long run. 🖤",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nobody is going to have a magic wand, a special pill or make you feel completely ready to recover. The difficult reality is that your therapists are there to support you but they cannot change you.

You sound like you want recovery and that’s amazing. You need to work hard for it now. It’s a lot of tears, resisting urges and honestly at times it feels hopeless. It’s okay if you can’t do it alone, that’s what IP is for.

Why do you keep changing therapists? Is it that they truly haven't been a good fit, or is it more that you don't want to get into the real issue and/or admit fault?

BTW, please remember that recovery is rarely linear. That's not an excuse to relapse but never beat yourself up if you do so. Just try to do better the next day. Man, that's so easy to say when I'm not the person in question. Believe me, I know how hard it is.

843,chthf4,EDReferral,1564091570.0,2019-07-25 16:52:50,"Here are some healthy ways to gain weight when you're underweight:

* **Eat more frequently.** When you're underweight, you may feel full faster. Eat five to six smaller meals during the day rather than two or three large meals.
* **Choose nutrient-rich foods.** As part of an overall healthy diet, choose whole-grain breads, pastas and cereals; fruits and vegetables; dairy products; lean protein sources; and nuts and seeds.
* **Try smoothies and shakes.** Don't fill up on diet soda, coffee and other drinks with few calories and little nutritional value. Instead, drink smoothies or healthy shakes made with milk and fresh or frozen fruit, and sprinkle in some ground flaxseed. In some cases, a liquid meal replacement may be recommended.
* **Watch when you drink.** Some people find that drinking fluids before meals blunts their appetite. In that case, it may be better to sip higher calorie beverages along with a meal or snack. For others, drinking 30 minutes after a meal, not with it, may work.
* **Make every bite count.** Snack on nuts, peanut butter, cheese, dried fruits and avocados. Have a bedtime snack, such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or a wrap sandwich with avocado, sliced vegetables, and lean meat or cheese.
* [Top it off](https://www.edreferral.com/blog/an-effective-approach-to-treating-anorexia-nervosa-683)**.** Add extras to your dishes for more calories — such as cheese in casseroles and scrambled eggs, and fat-free dried milk in soups and stews.
* **Have an occasional treat.** Even when you're underweight, be mindful of excess sugar and fat. An occasional slice of pie with ice cream is OK. But most treats should be healthy and provide nutrients in addition to calories. Bran muffins, yogurt and granola bars are good choices.
* **Exercise.** Exercise, especially strength training, can help you gain weight by building up your muscles. Exercise may also stimulate your appetite",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your brains natural response is to seek food. 
I call it the lizard brain (the brain stem and cerebellum) It's your basic instincts. 

Your brain is smart and knows that when you get home you have an unlimited food source, the perfect time to eat as much as possible becouse your not getting enough in the day. 

You most likely feel sick when you try to eat during the day may be for a few reasons:
-tummy isn't used to the food during the day 
-your body is still processing the food from the night before and isn't ready for more. 
-the eating disorder is saying no. 

I suggest you go to your doctor. It's simple but affective and will help you. In the mean time eat during the day. Start feeding yourself regularly, have something when you wake up, have something for lunch and have something for dinner. You don't have to have full meals yet so eat something more then increase to snacks when your ready.

What id recommend is as someone said above, meal prepping, or slowly trying to start eating more food during the day, preferably meals with plenty of protein or fibre in them as this will help you to remain full and keep your energy levels up. Also what someone mentioned is eating healthy foods e. g. an apple during the day, maybe some wholegrain carbs, fruits and veg etc. i know my advice isnt great but i hope it helps in someway! good luck&lt;3",iputmytrustinyou,1564064294.0,2019-07-25 09:18:14,"I used to experience this while I was under eating.  The longer I went under eating, the worse the episodes of binging were.  It seemed like my body was trying to play catch-up for all the food it had been missing out on.  To make matters worse, the food I would binge on was normally lower in nutritional value...so while I would feel physically too full, I didn’t feel satiated, and the desire (feeling of need) to eat was still there.  

It was terribly frustrating.  I felt like I had no control over myself when I began the binge.  But, I did have control, in that if I just gave my body what it needed nutritionally, then I wouldn’t have had the periods of binging.

I just want to acknowledge that everyone is different.  What is true for me, may not be true for you.  But you might be experiencing something similar to what I went through.  For me, the only thing that helped was eating consistently throughout the day.  It is important to give your body fuel.  I don’t know what your nutritional needs are, but for me, I started out needing 3 meals and 3 snacks a day since my portions began small.  After awhile of getting consistent meals, the urge to binge faded.",eva1588,1564074797.0,2019-07-25 12:13:17,"The answer is to go slow. At least it is for me. When I start to slow down I am able to notice how I feel. I notice my physical feelings and my thoughts. I can notice if my thoughts are perpetuating my physical feelings. Usually they are. I am can notice any signs of hunger or fatigue. If I feel hunger come on. I go to the kitchen and take out all the different foods I have prepared from all the different food groups. I try them. Some of them I dont want, and some of them I want a lot. I have the one or ones I want. I notice while I am eating what I like about the food. Maybe it is the saltiness, maybe its the spicy flavor, maybe the fat content,  or maybe it is a sweetness. I just notice that and maybe have something else of that quality. I eat until I find that the bits of food arent making me feel better. Then I wait to see if I am thirsty. And after about 30 minutes I have something to drink. Usually tea, water, or coconut drink. Then I feel very satisfied.  I know that not everyone can eat this way because you have to be alone, have no distractions, have a variety of foods already prepared. I dont work so I am able to do this and I love cooking and making things that I believe I will actually want to eat. The thing is our culture is not set up to live like this. We dont respect taking time to eat, or just taking time to take care of ourselves in general. So it is difficult. How are we supposed to know what to give ourselves if we dont take the time to listen to ourselves? I would just try to go slow and pay attention through out your day. Notice if you get hungry, notice if you dont, if you have such terrible anxiety  and anger that it covers up all other emotions feelings and sensations. That is often what happens to me and I end up having no appetite. But dont give up. Keep noticing these things. And try to honor your body and yourself, but doing what feels right. I believe its an ever changing life long experience. 

Side note: When you are in the kitchen  feeling like you are going to eat everything in site. Try if you can, to slow down. By all means eat as much as your heart tells you, but just try to slow down and be present while you are eating.

I could only eat in the evening and would eat massive portions because I didn't know when to stop. I had multiple ultrasounds and an endoscopy to reveal nothing wrong. Then I was on a medication for a couple months that I had to take with food in the morning and evening, so I was forced to start eating regularly. I really recommend just trying to force yourself to get on a regular eating schedule. I know how hard that can be, I've struggled with intentional and unintentional restriction too. It sucked in the beginning it would make me feel sick and sluggish but after a few weeks my body started to get hungry in the late morning and a lot of my nausea completely disappeared. I can eat a regular 2-3 meals a day now and almost all of the binging habits have gone away because I am fueled throughout the day and my body doesn't think I'm starving.

Starving yourself, in my opinion, becomes an eating disorder as soon as there's a part of your brain that thinks that you should do it. If you want to eat healthy you can do it two ways:
1. Eat 5 meals a day every 3-4 hours (meals are smaller, you have tree main and two snacks)
2. Eat 3 meals every 4-6 hours (meals are bigger and there are no snacks)
You shouldn't be fasting because of your mental state. You should drink 2-3 liters of water every day. For your thoughts I advise you to talk to a therapist. If you're not comfortable eating around your family and their comments bother you talk them what's up and/or try not eating in front of them",00455667,1563994229.0,2019-07-24 13:50:29,Yes it does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You need to very clear with him about your feelings. You need to tell him that the working out and other things have been triggering to you. Don't beat around the bush. Be up front and honest so that he understands the first time you tell him. If you need, maybe write out everything you want him to know and make sure you cover all those things when you talk to him

I understand why his comments make you feel insecure and dismissed. I would be upset too, especially since you've already asked him to stop. Make sure when you talk to him, you make it very clear you are serious about this. Don't write it off. Don't say ""hey, I kinda sorta wish you didn't say anything about my weight"". Tell him ""Stop commenting on my weight."" No it's, ands, or buts about it. If after this he still doesnt respect your wishes then you'll have to start having conversations on whether this relationship is a good fit. 

I think it's up to you to decide how much slack you feel comfortable giving him. As someone in a relationship while recovering, it's really hard navigating this with another person. I've had tons of conversations with my S/O. It's important to understand that it's hard to ""say the right thing"" all the time. If he is consistently making you uncomfortable to seeming to not respect your wishes at all, then that is a major red flag. But also recognize that he will mess up at times and he will say the ""wrong"" things. But you need to keep asserting yourself and putting your health first. 

You are not responsible for his weight and health.

It is okay to gain weight! It doesn’t mean you’re necessarily unhealthy. Sometimes it’s what our bodies want to do and is perfectly healthy if not just a neutral change. When we’re eating to satiety and giving our bodies enough rest, sometimes weight gain happens! Sometimes it happens at a certain point because we haven’t been treating our bodies right and they compensate by lowering BMR and weight gain happens even when behaviours don’t change!

 So, weight gain doesn’t necessarily imply unhealthiness - sometimes it is the healthy thing. And regardless imo, the pursuit of a certain kind of ‘health,’ especially through cal deficit/weight loss/exercise/eating ‘clean’ shouldn’t come before your mental wellbeing, for either of you.

I always tell him I love him and find him attractive regardless of his looks/weight, that he looks just fine the way he is, but he says he doesn't feel comfortable at his current weight, which is why I try to support that change instead.

I made the comment on his weight as a means of setting a reference; he's insecure about it so I believe that also might be a reason for his comments.

\- smoothies with those things but instead of PB, you can add a flavorless oil, like safflower or canola or any other that isn't like EVOO which can taste too savory.

\- ice cream with nuts mixed in

When I was anorexic (yes, you CAN recover), I always thought my ED was a victory, my neverending journey, it made me unique, special, almost better than others and def better than healthy-me. It was mine. It was me. 

You feel powerful having control over your diet and your body. Oh yes, sweet starvation, I remember laying on my bed, I felt empty af, I imagined myself walking on my own pale and skinny body and I did it, I fought my carnal instincts. I felt like I was capable of doing that therefore I was better than others. The harder my parents and doctors pushed me to recover the harder I detained myself from getting better, thinking I wouldn't let them take that, my ED away from me. 

So yes, I believe we all fear of getting better. But you don't have to go back to anything you don't want to. You can gain control over other things in your life. Having issues like this in your life might keep you away from reaching actual goals. It'd be sad if your only goal in life was being skinny af. 

I'm not saying I wanted to recover. At least not for the first 4 years.

When people make these kinds of comments, I have to remind myself that they don't understand what some people go through to be able to eat at all. They think they're doing what's best for their bodies, and that what's best for them must be best for everyone.

2: The comments that people make are always ignorant, unless they too have had an ED. Think about how long and challenging an ED is, and how we all have had to bang up against the hardships that have illustrated just how difficult it is to recover. Those are experiences that make us painfully aware of what it REALLY means to have an ED.  What that guy or woman said is absent of all these experiences. It's like commenting on trig or Physics when you've never even learned algebra or grade 5 science. If you can think -- in your mind -- ""This person has the ED knowledge of a newborn"" -- then you can properly contextualize this sort of ridiculous comment. (Example 2: a friend of mine shared that her child said "" Mom, you've got a big butt!"" -- this friend has a TINY butt! But to children, ALL butts are ""big"" -- that is their little perspective from a tiny person's view.

When that woman said what she did, you could have said ""you know, it's really important that we see food for what it really is: valuable energy AND a mechanism through which we socialize. The brownies are worthwhile so  long as we value life and the ability to enjoy it with others. If that's not valuable, then I am not sure calories are the biggest problem...""

&amp;#x200B;

OR you could say ""what is worthwhile to you?"" -- if she says ""oh, if it's beyond delicious!!"" -- then say ""yup, it's worth it.""  (Whatever she says...""yup, it's worth it."" -- because that is the answer every time!)

This might all sound super ridic, but it really needs to be how we change this world. 

What we've all had to endure (Ed sufferers) is so much pain and difficulty that would be almost in vain if we don't use it wisely.

     Thank you for pointing that out, gnosiscna. I feel that’s something perhaps overlooked. Our relationship to BAD foods, that we may only eat in private. I’m not comfortable myself yet to even do what she did, it’s so inspiring. What do you think about secret eating of foods; any more thoughts you have on it? 

     I’m struggling with eating during the day, and I make my boyfriend do takeout so we don’t eat in public, I feel picky and listen to Ana during the day, yet change into a sloppy, gross person (in my own head, still feels real but is not) that eats more until I’m full. Then I feel that the weight is put on me, I’m completely a different sort of person, I feel disgusting in my own body when I eat around others, yet disgust myself on my own, just fighting and wounding myself. 

     I’m vegan as well, so I already feel isolated in my eating. I am vegan for moral reasons, but it is making me sick and less sociable. 
     
     I recently dropped a lot of weight, not meaning to or doing anything differently. Now I feel more obsessed about body dysmorphia. The more I think about the scale, the more it triggers phobic, debilitating thoughts of binging that I don’t and haven’t done in so long. My image of what my body’s appearance is and how body dysmorphia plays a huge part of what I eat.

      Do you think any of all my ranting(haha) can come from Depersonalization Disorder or at least plays a role in my ED?",gnosiscna,1566261515.0,2019-08-19 19:38:35,"Secret eatings of food? Like hiding while eating? If so, depending on the situation, it could be good or bad. A bad example would be eating in secret out of shame, like a binge episode. Also, eating in secret because you’re afraid of what people might think is a bad one.  She did a good one, eating in private so she could finish eating without anyone else bringing up food comments. She did it because she knew she needed to finish eating in peace so her ed wouldn’t start talking too much.

Try to remember that if you’re doing exactly opposite of what your ed wants to do, it’s probably right. Like you said you sometimes eat until you’re actually full, even though it makes you feel like a gross person, that is a time you can try and counter your negative thought by saying “wait a minute, this is actually good. I am eating as a human should.”

Being vegan while struggling with an eating disorder is very hard. It’s possible to recover while vegan, but it’s not suggested because of the such limited variety of foods. The diet is already picky for you so you don’t have to make excuses. All of the facilities i’ve been to has had every patient stop being vegan and become vegetarian, at least for their time in treatment. Also, believe it or not, people cover up their true intentions with saying it’s a morals choice. Even if it is a moral choice, try to remember why you wanted to become vegetarian or vegan in the first place.

I’m not a therapist or anything, so I can’t tell you if your depersonalization disorder is related to your ed specifically. I think eating disorders are a symptom of something else, not just food.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its like nothing you do or dont do is helping. Its just chaos.  It could be you may have felt that you didnt have these issues when you were anorexic and bulimic because you felt more in control.

It may be you need to rest, to go for a walk, to stretch, to eat, to not eat. If you are not eating, dont beat yourself up about it. You will eventually get hungry, and if you listen to your body, it will tell you what to eat. Once you know, really enjoy yourself. Take pleasure in how good it tastes. Or maybe its making you nauseous- slowly step away and see if something else sounds better. Keep trying different foods until your body agrees. If nothing agrees, then step away. The key is going very slow so you can listen. Your body is so intelligent. It will not stear you wrong. Its our minds that throw us out of balance.

*""Your eyes are broken.""*

This was a phrase that my mother used to say to me throughout my recovery (which included my relapses, as well). With an internal mental dialogue of ""I need to lose more weight,"" ""I don't like the way I look,"" it's hard for one's perception to counteract those judgments (for example: If you feel that you don't like the way you look, it will be significantly more difficult to find something about yourself that you like/is ""good enough""). Our perception is painted by these negative thoughts, therefore the mind looks for external ""evidence"" (that is more often than not false evidence) that validates our internal experience. At times, that can mean seeing what is a distortion as something true and real. And that can be confusing and terrifying.

After having this dialogue for quite some time, those neural pathways in the brain have been reinforced, and are very hard to break free from. It takes conscious effort to create new neural pathways to replace those old, habitual thought patterns and behaviors.

If there's one thing I've realized along my own healing journey, it is this: No matter how much I try to change my body, nothing--*nothing*\--ever measures as ""good enough"" according my eating disorder. I wasn't happy with my body at my sickest, and I'm not necessary happy with my body in it's healthy weight-range.

 If you feel that you're too obsessed about the numbers, I would recommend setting up goals that are about strength and flexibility and obsess about those. Work up to lifting a certain anount, train to reach a certain number of reps, wind down after the gym with some yoga until you can do the harder poses.

What I’ve notice with myself and others with restrictive (rather than binge) tendencies, we will cook super rich, indulgent meals and then pawn it off on friends and family, not eating any of it ourselves. And then when cooking for ourselves, we’re back to ED monster concoctions. 

Case in point: yesterday I spent 2 hours making three-layer mini caramel chocolate tarts. Each one was approx 550 calories if I calculated right. I ate a quarter of one then brought the rest to my DBT group (most of them struggle with borderline, not EDs so they devoured them).

Yeah, I have to say, I am not relating to any of these comments. I never count the calories in what I cook anymore. It's very exhausting. I ask my family what they want for dinner and make it. I usually ask for their assistance to make my plates though, because I get really nervous doing that sometimes.

I get a sense of achievement out out of creating tasty food, although I cannot venture to adding anything to recipes and dishes that is outside my ‘safe’ range. I’m only starting into early stage recovery right now though, so maybe that may change, but I find it hard and very scary to believe.

Up until recently I always cooked on my own, and found it very hard to let my partner or anyone into the kitchen while I was there. I’m trying to make cooking a bit more collaborative now, but more often than not it ends up in tears when I feel like I’ve lost control of the situation.

My family and friends were really surprised that I had EDs because I honestly love food so much.

Sometimes when something changes real suddenly, we don’t know how to deal with it and we’re super hard on ourselves as a result, and it sucks that that’s what’s happening to you. My best recommendation is that you try your best to diet healthily. You need to eat. And no matter what your brain/others are saying, you’re allowed to. If your body is too deprived you could end up binging. Also there are so many complications that come with it, trying to lose weight this way is definitely not worth ruining your life over. And that’s what happens with an eating disorder is it takes over your entire life until you have nothing and no one left. Please try not to let it get to this point. I’m very glad you’re noticing your shift in behavior because it can help you stay safe. It sounds like you’re having disordered thoughts/behaviors, might not be a full fledged ed. This just means that you’re going through a bunch right now but it may not fit into one specific category, it’s sometimes the precursor to an ED. That being said, you still are allowed to get help NOW. Disordered eating is rough and I completely encourage you to try and talk to a therapist and maybe a dietician so that they can help you work out these thoughts as well as help you safely lose weight. It is 1000% possible to lose weight healthily, but eating disorders ruin everything and kill people. To sum that up, you’re definitely not being a healthy dieter, possibly struggling with disordered eating, and PLEASE get help.

It’s important to separate yourself from the disorder so when you think you’re convincing yourself that you’re just being overdramatic, that’s the disorder talking. You do have an eating disorder. Plain and simple. You could try to get better on your own, keep taking the pills, and eat in moderation to keep your binging at bay. Think of it like you have to do that so you won’t binge rather than it’s making you gain. You gotta start playing defence and fighting the disorder’s negative words. My therapist says to think of it in terms of values rather than desires, so, if you value a healthy life with the energy to do things, you know which way you can make your decision rather than what you want/don’t want in the moment. I think if you can’t do it on your own after a month (give yourself a goal with a timeline) then you should seek treatment. It is hard but you have to do it.

Even when I know I’m well within my limit of cals I’ll freak out if I can’t track something, but I am trying to get better at it. Some things that have helped me is to learn to love and respect yourself enough to not torture yourself over eating, something that is necessary to survive. You can also just estimate the calories and call it a day. I know that’s easier said then done but you have to allow yourself the freedom to say “okay, I’m not sure how many calories this was. But if I had to guess, 300.” And then move on. It takes practice to allow yourself that freedom of thinking like this but I promise you it’s liberating. I’m sure you track all of your other calories, so one meal isn’t going to negate that work!",AmaranthRoses,1565527816.0,2019-08-11 07:50:16,"If it feels like a switch you can make at this point, it might be helpful to track macros rather than calories. A burger? Call it 2 meat, 1 carb, 2 fat. In my head, I still sort of kept track of the calories but now I think mostly in macros which has been easier to track honestly. If that doesn’t seem feasible right now, you can find a similar food joint and sub that in, which works too. Not exact, but calorie counts are super inaccurate anyway so. 

Best of luck!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, I’m close to the skinniest I’ve ever been and she comments on how much I don’t eat. It’s extremely triggering to hear about the amount I’m eating whether it be too little or too much, WHILE I’m eating. 

In my experience I’ve hated talking to my mom about this stuff bc I feel uncomfortable talking about my struggles too. But at the end of the day, even tho your mom is probably unintentionally causing you mental stress that may trigger your ed, she’s still causing it. You have a right to feel comfortable and safe in your own house.

Confronting her will probably be scary and uncomfortable, I’m not going to lie. But it’ll be worth it. Maybe pull her aside one day soon and say something along the lines of “hey mom, I know you don’t mean any harm when you say this but it makes me uncomfortable to be reminded of the weight I’m gaining when I’m not thinking about it.” I had to tell my mom to please stop commenting on when I lost weight, even tho she meant it in the form of a compliment. I think about my weight constantly on my own time, and the times I was actually not thinking about it and maybe just laughing in the moment of something, it sucked to be reminded of it all over again.  Maybe pick a day next week or whenever so you have time to plan and prepare yourself without feeling rushed to talk to her.

From my experience, Wellbutrin acts very similarly to a stimulant (in some people), hence the appetite suppression. Wellbutrin is contraindicated for those who have eating disorders partially because it can cause weight loss and loss of appetite. It also lowers your seziure threshold and when you have an eating disorder, your threshold is already low. That being said, if your doctor's have determined the risk of this medication is low for you, then great! 

I eventually came to find out that the reason Wellbutrin worked well for me was because of these stimulant effects. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and the depression and anxiety actually ended up being a symptom of my untreated attention issues. I'm now on a stimulant medication and my appetite is GONE.

What I find helps is having a consistent schedule. Wake up at the same time everyday, go to bed around the same time, ECT. This way I could just schedule my meals instead of waiting until I'm hungry. I've told myself that I need to eat breakfast by 11am, eat lunch by 2/3pm, and eat dinner by 8/9pm. Doesn't matter if I'm hungry or not. I'm on a medication that doesn't let me intuitively eat. The sooner you recognize this the better. You can't just eat when you ""feel like it"" because you'll never feel like it. You have to just force it unfortunately. 

Most likely, the reason you feel like you can only stomach small snacks is because you aren't accustomed to eating full meals. If you've gone any period of time without eating the full amount you need, whenever you are confronted with a legitimate meal, it's gonna feel like too much, especially if you aren't even hungry to begin with. You have to go through the discomfort of eating more than you want in order to make it easier to stomach as time goes on. 

This is something you need to discuss with your psychiatrist because it is a very slippery slope. I understand not wanting to change your medication because it's ""the one"" that works, but you need to recognize that perhaps it isn't working well enough. You may benefit from another medication. As an individual with a history of an ED, it is super dangerous to be on any medication that eliminates appetites. Be honest with your doctor and yourself. Wellbutrin may help your depression, but if it causes a relapse, then it isn't a good medication for you. 

Sorry this is so long, I just really relate to this problem. Feel free to message me if you'd like and I wish you the best with this.",AmaranthRoses,1565143202.0,2019-08-06 21:00:02,Talk. To. Your.

The anorexia response can be triggered by even the smallest calorie deficit. You have to protect yourself by ensuring you always eat enough. Before you think - oh, that’s not normal.

They weigh you in kilograms and you are expected to gain .2kg a day which is about half a pound. The first day you don’t make weight they increase your meal plan and then start adding supplements which are ensure plus. They will add up to 4  per day

If you are a female goal weights are roughly 5lbs for every inch above 5 feet tall. For example if you are 5’4” your goal weight will likely be around 120lbs. Unless you’re a kid, then they’ll look at your growth chart from your pediatrician if available 

They don’t use tubes and if you refuse to eat for long enough they’ll send you to a nearby hospital for one. When you refuse to eat and don’t drink the supplements for it they’ll make you sit and the dining room table and stare at it all day until bedtime, then keep staring at it the next day, and all day everyday til you crack or get sent out for a tube. Most people crack. 

You get a menu with three main options to choose from for each meal plus sides and desserts. So you get to choose but options are limited. They don’t allow you to be vegetarian. They also limit water. 

No cell phones

BUT there is hope, I've found im happiest when i know i can eat more - whilst not over indulging.
A couple of months ago, i got into roller skating, its super fun, its exercise, and it builds muscle too! Which in turn, means you have to be eating more to help with your muscles. Its helped me change my mindset, instead of being defined by how i look, or what that number says on the scales, 
I define myself by what i enjoy, and who i am as a person, 
I still struggle with the scales and my perception of myself, but when I remember that life is about the living, and the amazing things you do and moments you make,
Starving and binging dont even come close to what its really about.
I hope this finds you well,
And go easy on yourself, relapsing isnt shameful, starving and binging isnt either, we are all trying our best
 
With love xx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
912,cl1ymr,iwasntlucid,1564746211.0,2019-08-02 06:43:31,If it is an option...please see a counselor and a nutritionist.,radishpickle,1564748192.0,2019-08-02 07:16:32,"Hello friend! Here are some tips and ideas I hope will be helpful for you. Please remember they are not a substitute for professional help. I’d definitely encourage you to work with some professionals should you feel the need to do so.

Hair loss is a common side effect of both stress and undereating/malnutrition, and both could be the case for you.

Regarding feeling underweight despite being at a “healthy” weight, I would encourage you to read about set point theory, according to which a person can be at an underweight weight /for their body/ while being at a technically healthy weight because their natural body weight is suppressed/they are not at their body’s set point. 

Recovery often feels impossible, but I assure you it is possible. It’s hard but so worth it. As much of your disordered eating stems from fear of choking, you need to run right into that fear. Here are some tips.
- Mental visualization. Imagine yourself eating food. When you feel anxiety rise up, and you feel your heart rate and breathing start to quicken, make efforts to inhale as slowly as possible and extend the exhale longer than the inhale. Continue with the visualization until it no longer makes you as scared. You can do different visualizations for different types of food (I imagine applesauce is much less scary than say... whole grapes or something with a higher choking hazard)
- Challenge your thoughts. Journaling can be very helpful for this. I’ve often written “ED thoughts” on one page, then challenged them on the next page under “Recovery Response” heading. If you find you struggle with a many ED habits and impulses/urges, maybe try “ED wants” and “Recovery Requires.”
- When you are eating and begin to panic about choking, force yourself to take deep breaths, keep eating, and distract yourself. Watching TV, playing on your phone, etc are good ways to do this while eating until your body builds the neural pathways to recognize that food is not a threat - by not eating/by freaking out about eating, you reaffirm that food is a threat and make it harder for yourself to recover.

Finally, regarding your comment about being unable to eat when nauseated or when having no appetite - during the worst part of my anorexia, I was constantly nauseated due to low blood sugar and my body gradually stopped producing physical hunger signals because I was so malnourished. The way for me to stop feeling nauseated and to get my appetite back was actually to eat. I had to force myself to eat, and force myself to eat a lot. The thing is, even though I didn’t have physical hunger, I was so incredibly hungry - I was overwhelmed by mental hunger, which was my body desperately trying to make me eat. Furthermore, in people recovering from restrictive eating disorders, hunger and fullness cues often malfunction - we usually don’t feel as hungry as we logically should, and we get satisfied/full much too soon. We also have slowed digestive emptying. Due to low quantities of food for a sustained period of time, we become unable to comfortably eat a normal and healthful portion of food in order to nutritionally rehabilitate. You will need to force yourself for some time if you find this happening to you, but over time your stomach will begin to stretch and digest and you will find it easier.

If you feel like you need to eat, you probably do, and you especially do if you are underweight/suppressing your natural body weight. As Tabitha Farrar says, “there is no such thing as too much food in recovery from a restrictive eating disorder.”

I would encourage you to look up the MinnieMaud homeostatic recovery guidelines to ensure you eat enough. :)

Best of luck!",Ellen0111,1564750134.0,2019-08-02 07:48:54,"Just know you're not alone. I was in treatment for my eating disorder two years ago and there was a girl with a similar struggle that you have....couldn't get herself to eat for fear of choking. We went from php (full day treatment) to residential treatment together and eventually worked our ways back down in terms of level of care. She had different needs but still needed help. Sounds like you do too. Eating disorders are complicated. It's not just anorexia or bulimia or binge eating disorder. Please get in touch with a therapist or counselor, preferrably one that specializes in trauma and eating disorders. Wishing you the best.",lilgeoffrey,1564765377.0,2019-08-02 12:02:57,"Ideally you need a therapist (one who is knowledgeable on phobias and anxiety disorders would be best) and a dietician. If they're available to you then welcome them with open arms.

In the meantime however, look into protein/meal supplement powders. It's an ""easy"" way to get calories in without having to physically eat. If you mix the powder with full fat milk then you are getting in a good amount of energy and nutrients in just a small glass and if youre consistent and working on increasing then hopefully you should see your weight start to go up with them.

This isn't a long term solution though because ultimately you need to earn to eat. It's simply a start to stop you losing more weight and start you gaining. It's extremely important to remember this is NOT to replace your current food, but in ADDITION. I used a banana powder for a while and it was actually really quite nice (ill link it when I find it).

But yes, by the sounds of it, the hair loss is due to the lack of food/nutrition. There COULD be another reason but I sincerely doubt it. Also obsessive and anxiety related thoughts are exacerbated by malnutrition so you have likely found yourself in a bit of a vicious cycle of anxiety over eating &gt; not eating &gt; more anxiety over eating etc so it's super important that you get on top of this ASAP

You need to heal for yourself and your wellbeing. It's hard work, and especially hard when a previously supportive person now has flipped to the other side. You are strong enough to do it though.

I'm actually infuriated. Did she even apologize? I'm suffering from an eating disorder too and it took me years to realize my mother's behavior of on and off love mixed with on and off abuse helped it grow. I'm not saying your mother is anything like mine, but **a parent should never slap a child or routinely verbally abuse their child. I don't care how ""fatigued"" they are. I don't care how ""exhausted"" they are. I don't care how much they've done for the human that they** ***CHOSE*** **to bring into the world. I don't care how old their child is. I don't think this excuse for slapping would be used for any adult other than a mother, honestly. Society is insanely biased when it comes to moms and excusing their poor behavior.** 

She is probably going through her own struggles, yes, but please recognize that it is NOT your fault and it was not wrong for you to lean on your own mother for help! As a mother, if she can no longer properly help you, she should have said so calmly and moved on. Physical assault is not a normal reaction. Please talk to your therapist about this and don't fall into thinking that your mother's behavior is your fault or that you should isolate yourself. And if your mother is humble enough, kindly and calmly suggest she goes to therapy and/or anger management. Explain to her how terrible she is making you feel and that you had no intention of upsetting her, that you were simply trying to share your feelings and thoughts. Ask her to express her feelings and thoughts about the situation with you as well. Tell her to let you know in calm ways when she is too stressed for certain conversation and then hug it out. I hope your mom is someone who can actually take this kind of criticism (and if she can't, even though she can clearly dish it out, you may be dealing with a much heavier issue when it comes to her). 

Try to find an online friend or group of friends who you can speak regularly and openly with. I say online because that can help when it comes to sharing deep things that may feel more uncomfortable in person, but if in person seems more appealing to you then try that. Perhaps your therapist can suggest a nearby recovery group to you. They usually meet every week or two. This will help you to *always* have someone other than your mother to speak with so you won't have to walk on eggshells and can fully express any fears or happiness without repercussions. 

I note that you put stress on the word ""trying"" when it comes to recovery and asked if you should get sicker to bother her less. Let me say, I'm glad you've continued the treatment your mother sought for you (as was her responsibility to do as a parent of a severely ill child). I am a few years older than you and my body is wrecked from my ED. Please heed what your therapist says. Please make sure you follow the plan given. Please find a support group, especially if you feel you need to talk or need to be encouraged to continue. Please do not fall back into illness and isolation because of your mother's stress/inability to cope. It's not worth it.

People don't know what to say, and will say things that they think are helpful but come off as insensitive or hurtful (like telling a person who just lost a pregnancy ""It's ok, just try again!""). This year a friend's MIL who I only see maybe once a year at Thanksgiving told me that I looked ""so much better"" than the year before because before I was ""just too skinny and - ugh - \*grossly\* thin last year!"" (and in reality, I weighed less than I did the year before  I want to punch her freaking teeth in). I was furious about her comments about my body. I didn't know what to say to her (that I wouldn't regret...especially at a big Thanksgiving family dinner) so I just kept drinking as she continued to blather and I think all I could manage was an ""mmmhm"" and terse smile. I think my friend or her husband had mentioned to her about my ED and she went about it the wrong way. Even my friend and her husband would say ""You look great, you don't look too skinny! Really, you look healthy!"" and I'd say ""Dude, I weigh less than I did last time you saw me and I'm not healthy!"". It's really hard. 

You \*do\* need to keep eating. I think a better response from people (please by all means tell me if this is \*not\* helpful!) would be ""Yes! Keep going! You're getting a little \*healthier\* day by day!"" and not comment about your \*body\*, hotness, etc. It's small steps to get to your goal and can take a long time. You have to physically AND mentally heal, and before you can be completely physically recovered you have to get get dat \*mental fitnessss\*, gurl. And people telling someone with an ED at a low weight that their physical appearance \*looks hot\* is obviously detrimental. I don't blame you for crying, and it's commendable that you said ""Please don't comment on my weight it makes me uncomfortable"". I don't think I could've responded without cursing. With someone who ""doesn't get it"", I think saying ""I'd rather not talk about it"" to change the subject, or ""Thanks, but I'm trying to focus on my health and not my looks because of how this ED distorts my thinking about body image"". 

I don't know, I struggle with how to reply too. That's how I would \*hope\* to respond, but of course it's easier said than done (see Thanksgiving example, lol!).

You look extremely underweight and I am very concerned about how much you're eating and your health, nonetheless, you can be underweight and still look very pretty today.

You’d think people would be more aware of what these kinds of words do (that’s like EDs 101!) but not everyone has been absorbed in the world of EDs like we have.

I was in a similar place to this once (also Anorexia, BP subtype for many years, now I’m at a healthy weight), so here is my take on things:

When I think back to how severely underweight I was, and the comments I got then, as well as the lack of concern by some people in my life, it actually makes me angry. However, the way I see it now, is that these family members, friends, etc. had seen me so ill for so long that they sort of got used to it. And so when they saw me even slightly better, the contrast was probably a little surprising, in a good way, and they couldn’t help saying something.

Something that really helped me was I made a list of the reasons I was trying to recover. 1. So that I don’t have competing relationships between my ED and my boyfriend 2) so that I can finish my doctoral degree... I found that in the times where I really really don’t want to eat or really want to purge, having that list handy can make it easier to remember those reasons why I am fighting against my ED rather than engaging in my ED behaviors.

These are not the only reasons, there are many others

I have/had the same issue my self. I also dont know the 'why', but to me the origin of my dislike doesnt matter that much. I have a long list of foods/flavours I dislike. I dont like mayo, overly rich foods, brussel sprouts, kale, fish (apart from some sushi), overly salty foods, overly savory foods, overly 'fatty' foods, etc

This really limited my food selection, when I went out to dinner what I would find acceptable to eat was small, also if someone prepared my meal &amp; it contained a food I dislike I just wouldnt eat it. All and all it made it easy to restrict food intake, which lead to me being underweight

I knew it was bad, but I would just say 'oh but I just dont like those foods, and I cant help that'. I knew I should eat, so to get around being presented with foods I didnt like, I started to make my own meals. After a while it became fun, and it was an adventure to try to make all these different foods. Through this I learned that I dislike traditional western meals, but love eastern meals. When you make your own food you know exactly what you're putting in it, you can make anything you want. Dont want to eat that much? Thats ok too, just make a small rice dish.

I think ""true"" binge eating is actually quite rare. I believe it's more accurate to call it ""reactive"" eating. And I suppose that definition about feeling out of control fits with whatever we call it because what is happening is your higher prefrontal cortex decision making has been set aside while your survival instincts kick in and direct you to keep eating. You do not have to be low body weight for this to happen - it's related to complex hormonal pathways. Any time I restrict (calories or my eating window) I will eventually compensate by eating a lot - I can't help it. I also understand the GI drama that can lead to one wanting to limit intake, but because it ultimately leads to reactive eating (which is definitely hard on anyone's digestion), it ends up being a counterproductive action. Your experience with food is valid, as is the suffering you feel. I'm sorry this has become something in your life that needs your attention, but if I can encourage you to let go of restricting your food and eating windows, I really think that's the only path toward real health.

One of the cool things about the Caenivore Diet is..  You don't eat 3 meals a day.  You eat when you are hungry and you eat until the mouthful you are chewing on is no longer pleasurable.  It's way harder to apply than it sounds but it can literally be made that simple because when you induce flavor fatigue by simple limited menu options, you will still find food desirable if you actually need it and only as long as you need it.

One tool I use is I ask myself if I would like to cook and eat another burger patty or ribeye and you would be surprised at how often the answer is ""No.""  Because Im not hungry.  I'm being a botch and craving junk.

I just want to stay off by saying I identify with your mentality with approaching the school year and I suffer from that as well. I’ve noticed my ed emerges whenever changes are occurring in my life, but as I’ve gotten older I’ve taken extra precautions to avoid getting stuck in negative thought patterns. 
It’s incredible that you want to make progress. I think the fact that this desire, to prioritize a healthier you, has amounted within you is already half of the battle. I’ve noticed with my inner ed voice that it takes a lot of energy to quiet the negative talk down, so I make sure I have other things that combat some of that stress. 
I journal every day in order to check in with myself and to identify my goals and hold myself accountable. I think that writing about your future self can help with visualization and build the strength it takes to get the ball rolling.
Another tool I have is mediation. I’ve personally benefited tremendously by listening to mediations focusing on appreciating your body and reframing the challenging thoughts. I know mediation isn’t for everyone, but it can calm the nerves in a lot of situations and it can’t hurt to share what helps :)

As someone who keeps a journal I would break up with you if you did this to me. You can’t be trusted.,phawning,1566272856.0,2019-08-19 22:47:36,"Beyond the obvious fact that is the main focus of people's retort, which is you read her journal and it was an invasion of privacy, there is a lot more here to examine. I think in part, it may be a relief to her that someone in the world is concerned for her wellbeing because eating disorders are psychiatric diseases that turn into physical manifest illnesses harming organ systems and tissues over time. 

It's hard on the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and can lead to problems with depression, suicidal ideation, trouble concentrating, forgetfulness, anxiety, etc... I definitely think admitting you read the journal would cause an unnecessary diversion from your main concern at this point. Yeah, that's not great, but also that's something you need to work on in terms of trusting your partner.

I whole heartedly agree that looking for indicators such as sallow skin, abdominal distress, binges, using the bathroom after meals, and other food behaviors such as being very picky, breaking up food into small bites, and even restriction between larger meals could be an adequate segue into discussion about bulimia.

Actually exercising is a type of bulimia, believe it or not. Ridding yourself of the calories consumed is a way that many people go about anorexia...eating what you want then making sure it's all burned off. Whatever prevents the body from receiving the nutrition it needs to baseline operate.

I think your concern and compassion can go a long way to even building the trust you are lacking right now. But remember ED are very tricky. People get defensive and go into denial. I would definitely suggest firstly reading support threads for people who have and/or are involved with people that suffer from an ED. There are many things that can trigger obstacles in communication and you will need to be sure what those might be. For instance, heightened focus on appearance is a hugely inappropriate thing to comment on. For instance, you look healthier can mean to someone with an ED....you are fat now. The eating disorder has it's own mindset that isn't one belonging to the person with the disease.

I for one, think it's awesome you are even reaching out and investigating on her behalf. Whatever, no one is perfect, we're all working on it. Try to avoid the betray of trust in the future. If you need to talk more, you can freely hit me up.",sacca7,1566300007.0,2019-08-20 06:20:07,"In a relationship, there are no secrets. Secrets destroy trust. If you and her are serious about the relationship, she should bring up this mental disorder to you, she needs to share it, just as if she was OCD, or depressed, or whatever.

Eating disorders are mental disorders. The behavior stems from deep psychological trauma or imbalances.

Sometimes, when we feel something is wrong (our partner is cheating on us, they are keeping something from us, etc) we do need to investigate to learn. Imagine being in a relationship where you partner is cheating on you, and the only way you might learn is to read her email or journal. Often, this is the way people find out someone is cheating on them. Then, yes, there is a minor fault for looking into someone else's private space, but it can bring to light the major falsehood in the relationship.

8 years of bulimia is no joke. This might be a lifelong habit. You might want to consider if you are ready to support someone with this condition. My experience? My sister has had an ED since she was 13, she is now 54. She just got out of ICU and onto a regular floor of the hospital after having been resuscitated from 3 cardiac arrests.

Anyways, enough about me.  i just wanted you to know that there are people that are going through similar things as you, and they can help you through the way.  maybe even try to open up a bit, too.  food isn’t something people should stress about, (haha ironic of me to say that) and you should take things slow.  start by trying to get help.  and you don’t need to tell everyone, like your friends and teachers.  start with parents, and maybe start seeing therapy and a dietitian.

Exercise is not a requirement to exist on this earth. It's not a requirement to earn your ability to eat. Exercise should be a part of your life, only if **you** genuinely want it to be. And it should be something enjoyable and fun, not something that you do to tick the box of XX minutes a week or XXXX steps a day or anything like that.   


You are in recovery from over-exercise and a restrictive ED. Would you tell someone in recovery from alcoholism that it's actually reccomended that they should have a glass of wine with dinner? Hell no! Would you tell someone with an exercise addiction that they need to workout x times a week? Hell fucking no!  


If you want to have joyful movement in your life, find something you enjoy and only do it when you want to. Try something you were never addicted to or abusing. It seems like cardio and lifting were abused previously. Maybe take a gentle yoga class or a dance class or try doing short nature walks or rockclimbing? There are many ways to move your body that are fun and keep you well.

Example: Cream of vegetable soups are basically liquids. The texture is similar to let’s say a smoothie. That’s pretty safe. Is there a vegetable you like? Potatoes are usually universally liked. Try a cream of potato soup. If you’re feeling daring you can try adding some green onion on top of the soup. Another good food to try would be peanut butter on toast. Fruit smoothies.

I'm currently recovering after 10 years, and it's been super helpful to have:

A) Someone to talk to openly during mealtimes. My husband talks to me via text for 2 hours a day over lunch to help logically argue those thoughts and remind me why I'm fighting against this. 

B) Having someone to not only support you, but to play devil's advocate for the ED voice. Having people ask me ""why/how does that help you?"" or ""would that make any sense if someone were saying that to your sister?"" helps add a little logic to the situation.

C) Having people work with me on reminders of what the illness takes from me (ability to work, improve at work, socialize, hair, organ failure, etc) and what I gain with recovery (freedom, my identity, feelings, real control over my life, etc.).

one of the hardest things on me as I recovered was having my parents comment on how good I looked even how happy they were to see me doing better and not in my eating disorder. The thing was they just assumed that and didn't really ask. I was so embarrassed of the weight I'd gained and everyone saying how recovered I was that I don't think I would have admitted to feeling awful even if anyone had asked. I felt obligated to go along with the story that I had gained weight and therefore I was healed. This was far from the case. My body was healing physically but my mind was in agony. I started self harming to deal with the depression, anxiety and anorexia. 

So my advice would be not to focus on your sisters weight when you speak to her but try to find out how she's feeling about life and herself in general, apart from her body. Let her know that she's so much more then her body and that it's not the most important or powerful thing about her.

 I have lost and gained like 15kg for 4-5 times and every time it happened completely differently. First time I lost the fat in my legs first, but then the second time i had the most trouble losing it from the legs. My bum used to look great, now none of my fat goes to my bum even when im gaining a lot of weight . What im saying is-not only that fat/weight distribution is individual, it differs in one person during different periods as well.

Great news though - you can literally choose the body shape you want to achieve with exercise. Want bigger legs? Do some weight training exercises for your legs! Your arms might seem bigger because you are exercising them a lot. Switch an arm day for a leg day. Also remember to eat some proteins because you can't grow your muscles otherwise.

Just the fact that you are asking this question and thinking about how to make things better for her, you are very much on the right track. Part of the reason many people develop eating disorders is because of this fat phobic diet culture world we live in. We are raised to demonize fat so when someone is battling this horrific and dangerous mental illness and working to get better, they can still overwhelmed with a fear of getting fat because surely that is “bad” even if it means making great strides to improve mental health. I think it can be helpful to remind her (even if she doesn’t ask these specific questions) how much you love and care for her and you don’t just love the way she looks, you love her for who she is. That’s another reason people tend to develop eating disorders is that we get so tied up in putting our value only in our appearance when the fact is human beings are so much more than that. When she does ask you questions directly related to her looks and appearance you can tell her that she is and always has been beautiful to you. Best of luck to you both!",invisblezombie,1567516169.0,2019-09-03 08:09:29,"Hi, I’m the OP. Thank you for this advice and your kind words :)",PerceptualModality,1567524490.0,2019-09-03 10:28:10,"I would suggest asking her where she's at emotionally and asking why she's feeling the need for some reassurance / validation.  I would provide some validation that is NOT in the form of talking about weight / body image.  I think getting to the root of what she's REALLY asking for (love and validation) and addressing that, rather than addressing the eating disorder is a more healthy way to answer the question.  


For me, when I asked ""do i look fat"" what I'm actually looking for is reassurance and support.  It took me a long time to learn that ""feeling fat"" was really feeling lonely, sad, insecure, uncomfortable, grumpy, anxious, tired, or any other negative emotion.  Because of my eating disorder, I attributed all negative feelings to ""feeling fat"".  I needed to know i didn't look fat because then I knew I was doing the ""right things"", which only encouraged my disordered behaviour.  Focusing on the emotions and providing validation and support for those EMOTIONS instead of validating and supporting the BEHAVIOURS is what's important.

He always tells me things like no I don't think you're fat. I think you have fat like everyone else and it's a good thing. And then he talks to me about how beautiful I am and that no matter what I weigh I am beautiful. It may be different because I've never been underweight so that was never a health concern for me. In my experience this helps. I think that using the word fat as an adjective  can be triggering but using it as a noun can actually be very helpful.

Honestly, for me, when I ask those types of questions, I've already decided that yes I am and I hate my body and nothing will change that--it's usually coming from a place of being totally overwhelmed and stressed out and feeling like I'll never be enough. What's most helpful to hear is a ""hey, what's up? I think you look great, I love the way your \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ looks in that."" It feels less dismissive and more honest than just a ""you're not fat"" which is easy for me to brush off as him just telling me what I want to hear (and leads to me getting more frustrated). It also opens the door for me to state what's actually on my mind (sometimes it's just a ""I look terrible, I can't figure out what to wear"" other times, it provides me an opportunity to reflect on what might be giving me a case of the overwhelm-ies).  


Another thing that I SUPER appreciate when my husband does is just randomly compliment me on my body--especially areas/aspects of it that I tend to hyper focus on. So often all that's preached is not saying ANYTHING about a loved one's body in recovery but, for me, I then end up thinking that no one is saying anything because my body truly is disgusting. It's not all the time (because then I'd feel like it was trite) but when it happens, I have a moment of ""oh, ok, maybe my body isn't as horrible as I think it is."" For example, I've recently reached a point in my recovery where I'm allowed to exercise again and my husband and I have gotten really into rock climbing/bouldering--I generally feel weak and get down on myself for lack of muscle tone but a few days ago I was working on a route and my husband out of the blue just says to me ""holy shit babe, your back is looking really jacked, you're getting so strong!"" and I just about melted. It pulled me out of my ""my body is a gross useless piece of shit"" mindset and I found myself thinking ""oh, maybe I am doing something good for myself, I'm able to build muscle and get strong again.""",invisblezombie,1567528000.0,2019-09-03 11:26:40,"Hi, thank you for replying with this advice :)

Don’t get me wrong, that’s obvious. I take inspiration in people with eating disorders who recover and go on to be a healthy, normal, weight. However, many people with certain eating disorders such as bulimia, BED, and EDNOS can not have this mentality that you can eat whatever you want and being obese is ok, which lately, seems to be the majority of the recovery stories that are floating around. It’s unhealthy to be underweight, but it is also unhealthy to be overweight and I’m sick of body positivity for people who are clearly unhealthy being pushed.

My sister was made fun of all throughout high school for being naturally skinny. Of course, I was jealous and still am, that she can eat whatever she wants and not gain weight. She feels horrible about the body shaming she gets. 

Most people with bulimia and bed are afraid of ‘if I stop purging, I will gain weight, and not in a normal sense, but to the fact that I will be obese’. I have EDNOS, and engage in C/S and binge purge behaviour, and if I kept everything down, I would be where I was before, A bmi which put me at the high end of obesity. I then starved myself down to 75 pounds and was in the hospital for a year. I was miserable both ways. I am a normal bmi now, on the lower end, but still normal. Hell, we are all normal. But pushing pro-obesity isn’t helping either. I don’t know how to tell a person with an eating disorder they are putting on weight, but maybe a dietitian could help her to be healthy without going overboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IP 1: Medical Floor

Staff members were friendly. Was kept on an NG tube for 7-8 days. Connected to a heart monitor 24/7 as well. During that time I was on complete bed rest, only allowed to get up to use the bathroom. When using the bathroom I had to leave the door a crack open while a staff member waited outside. They then checked to make sure i didn’t purge. After having the NG removed I started a meal plan and my meals were supervised. I also earned access to use the bathroom without supervision after 2 hours after meals. Total hospitalization was 14 days exactly. Every morning around 5 I was woken up for blood work and doctors/nurses came to check on me. Blood Pressure a few times a day. I essentially receive no therapy during this time as it was about medical stabilization. I was weighed daily and never told my weight. I was allowed electronics.

IP 2: Medical Floor 

Same as the first one except staff became meaner as I was back again. NG was for 2 weeks. I stayed around 2 months this time. This was frustrating as I was in denial and didn’t want to be there. It was boring as I wasn’t allowed talking to other ED patients on the medical ward. Was then referred to a day program because of my lack of progress. Was evaluated by a psychiatrist.

PHP/ Day Program on Psych Ward

I was there 2 weeks total. Some of my worst hospital experiences were during those two weeks.  Although I got to go home at night I left super late and arrived super early basically making it feel like I didn’t have more liberty than the unit. The psych unit was not specialized for eating disorders and the staff didn’t understand/ became angry and abusive. Was locked in a 4 by 4 metre room all day with another anorexic aside from meals. Patients on the psych ward were also kept in their rooms. Some were psychotic and sometimes the police had to come in because they became violent. I went on a hunger strike because I was miserable and got kicked out of the program and was re hospitalized on the medical floor.

IP 3: Medical Floor

I was placed here while they waited for me to have a bed available in the mental hospital that specialized in eating disorders and other. I was there maybe a week. As punishment they placed me in an isolation room. The doctors became harsh telling me that I was too problematic for them and that I had brought this on myself. Psychiatrist told me basically that I was a lost cause to him. They were mean and cold. One of the recreational workers was kind and gifted me a couple of things before I left. 

IP 4: The Mental Hospital 

This resembled stereotypical residential treatment kind of. Each patient had a room but it wasn’t white walls and we weren’t locked in our rooms. There were two sides to the ward, the first side was for new patients and more fragile ones who needed more supervision (6 beds) and the other side was for more independent patients who weren’t dangerous to themselves (10 beds) it was an adolescent unit. Starting on the first side, to earn going to the better side I had to complete all my meals and be unproblematic. I wasn’t allowed on this side to have anything sharp including pencils. Bathroom was supervised. Weighed twice a week with blood pressure also twice a day. If I wanted to leave I had to reach my target weight and I was expected to gain a kg a week or I would have the option to be on either bedrest or drink a boost/ensure after every meal. Everyone was allowed one 10 minute phone call a day. No electronics allowed aside from like MP3 players. Here I received therapy and made many friends. It was very difficult though because staff is always desensitized to our conditions and would often make hurtful remarks. You were often blamed if you didn’t gain weight even if you didn’t do anything wrong and a lot of patients self harmed on the unit because of a lack of feeling of control. There was a school in the hospital you could attend when you were healthy enough but if you didn’t make your weight that week it was revoked for you. It made schooling hard and it was very lonely and boring living the same routine every single day. We didn’t go outside more than 15 minutes a day and often I opted not to go for the walks because I was scared I would lose weight. You did however get passes home when you started to get better. I was given medication to try and help me. I was there I think 4-5 months.

IP 5: Mental Hospital

Same hospital same rules but meaner staff because when you come back they hate you. Because I was back, I was on bedrest until I made my weight. 2 weeks.

IP 6: 

Same story. Signed a treatment refusal but ended up going back.

IP 7:

I became aggressive and my relationship with the staff declined every time I went back. I was so unhappy and felt misunderstood. I felt I hadn’t progressed at all. One month. I couldn’t take bedrest anymore and just cried every day. I hated everything.

IP 8:

Was threatened with a contract and if I didn’t abide I would be kicked out of treatment. I did my best and completed it but then signed a treatment refusal for a follow up and never went back again. I was there for 2 months (still on FUCKING BEDREST).

After my final IP and upon reflection I learned a lot of things. The first one being that I never want to go IP ever freaking again and I never have. I’ve learned that despite being surrounded by a medical team, my willingness to recover is ultimately what made me healthy again. During my hospitalizations, I went in with the most half assed mentality and thought that they would be able to convince me to get better. I thought medication would cure me. I basically thought I could get away with not doing all the work. Obviously, it took me a very long time to learn and mature throughout my process. I essentially held on to my disorder because I believed it was who I was. It made me unique. It made people pay attention to me. It sheltered me from the real world. It reduced me until I couldn’t recognize myself. After spending so much time on my own, I learned to appreciate the little things that made me happy. Small things such as being allowed to have music, drawing, having something in a meal I enjoyed and being able to step outside for even a minute could make a difference in my day. Treatment helped me verbalize my issues but I helped myself rediscover who I wanted to be. 

If I could talk to myself before my first hospitalization, I would tell myself that the number of times you go, the weight you’re at and how little you eat doesn’t determine your worth. You have so much more to offer than your weight and what you eat. 

I know you aren’t asking for advice but if you do choose to go IP, make the most out of the experience and don’t waste it thinking you can be sick once you get out. Take care.",superschuch,1567690194.0,2019-09-05 08:29:54,"I’ll write a more detailed reply when I’m not on mobile. My first residential ED specific treatment was terrible, I left AMA and found a place better suited to my needs. That residential center was better for me and I went back for a tune up even for 2 weeks when I needed further support. 7 years after completing the treatments, I was struggling and reached out to them again and used their PHP with housing. I’ve had four ED-specific admissions at 2 facilities. I also tried a local IOP this summer and that wasn’t a good experience as insurance wouldn’t cover therapy or a dietician if I was in IOP and the program said I needed a higher level of care because of trauma yet the programs they referred me to either did not treat trauma or used methods that had not worked for me before and had minimal individual therapy. I’ve also had inpatient experiences in general psych wards where they use antipsychotic medication as a treatment for ED and punishment like not allowing showering or taking away your belongings, bed, etc for difficulty complying. Terrible experiences with those units except for 1 that provided more individualized care, had other ED patients, and worked with you and your family to move you to step down care. In that experience, unfortunately my family choose step down care that was nearest to them as opposed to what was recommended and it wasn’t appropriate for my needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was In recovery and concerned about some ED habits she had developed and she kept saying things that were triggering for me but she kept convincing me she was fine. 

However hard I tried to set boundaries, she kept doing/saying the triggering things. My therapist at the time suggested I move out the house because it was getting really hard for me in my recovery and was starting to affect our friendship (I tried to avoid talking to her because it was so hard to deal with triggering things but also see someone I cared about who appeared in denial). 

What helped me was, I wrote down what she was saying/doing that was triggering and wrote an alternative that wasn’t so bad or things that didn’t trigger me. We sat one evening and we went through the list and I think her having something to refer to helped. 

However, it was difficult to address the fact I was worried about her and her ED habits, I suggested she see her doctor but she didn’t want to and asked that we didn’t discuss our “eating issues” so we didn’t. I’ve since moved out (our lease ended, not because of my therapists advice) and she’s  told me she’s now in counselling which I’m very happy about but I think I need to “mute” her on social media as her posts continue to affect me. This is something you could try? That way you don’t remove them as friends from social media but you don’t have to see what they’re doing?

Another thing to remember is that the triggers are all day, everyday for most of us (you too). It's not just your bf that is causing the triggers, but ALL the world because face it: so many disordered habits and practices are ""normal"" now.  

It's hard- if not impossible - to shield yourself from being triggered, so the goal is to try and become resilient.

When you look back on your life a year from now, 5 years, 20 years, do you want to see yourself improve or be held back? It’s hard to look at things that way when you’ve been friends for so long, but sometimes we outgrow our environment or friends. 

I had a good friend for many years, not 12, but about 6. She had mental health issues and so do I. About 4 years into our friendship, I decided I needed help and was always working on myself from there on. Therapy, medication, stress relief, choosing to go places and see people that would either help me, or be neutral. And I tried to keep helping her. I tried to share what I learned and how she could get help too. She wasn’t ready to change like I was changing. It was exhausting. Seeing improvement in myself, and then being pulled back down into bad thoughts or bad habits. 

I was always putting effort into or friendship but she couldn’t see it when she was in a mentally bad place. And there’s only so much you can do to support someone who won’t see what’s in front of them, or try getting help doing that.

About a year ago we gently drifted apart. I stopped putting all my effort into the friendship like I had been. She asked me why I unfollowed her with my fitness account on Instagram about 4 months after I did. I told her my therapist recommended I segment my life so I’m not overwhelmed and jolted by different things like that. So I only followed mental health advocates, healthy people with good relationships with their bodies, etc. 

We still follow each other with our main accounts, and snapchat, so we see what each other is doing. And I’m sure she talks shit about me to her new, equally as mentally unhealthy friend (we all went to high school together), but it doesn’t directly affect me and I have been able to focus on myself, improve immensely, learn about myself. All the good things. 

And during the bad times, the relapses, the episodes, the struggles, I handle them better when I’m fighting for myself and not trying to save someone else who is only struggling against help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the weight gain is probably water, especially if you were purging and sweating to lose the weight. After being chronically dehydrated your body is used to holding onto all the fluid it can get. After a few weeks your hormones will level out and your body will let go of any extra fluid. Another potential cause of weight gain is just the extra food in your digestive system traveling through. 

I think it would be prudent of you to see a dietician and a physician during this time. Your electrolyte levels need to be monitored during refeeding due to these fluid shifts.",MHunchosLips,1568223608.0,2019-09-11 12:40:08,Just go to gym brudda,jackandjill_nash,1568225985.0,2019-09-11 13:19:45,"A few things...

It sounds like you put your body into starvation mode, and then binge, and then purge, and then put it back into starvation mode, and it repeats. Because you cycle in and out of starvation mode your body doesn’t feel secure knowing that the next meal is on its way. That’s one of the reasons you may be getting these binge impulses, and also a likely cause for why you’re gaining weight. Your body is worried starvation mode will come back and so is storing excess calories. 

I would start off by buying and beginning to read the book “Brain Over Binge.” Suggestions for bloodwork and to see a dietitian are also very good. Therapy might not help with your bulimia, but it’s a generally good thing to do especially since I imagine there are body image issues at play here",andreea_carla_b,1568234103.0,2019-09-11 15:35:03,"Such great advice from the other redditors!

As aomeone already said, the extra pounds is probably water weight and your body trying to conserve energy as best as it can given the purges, restrictions amd high intensity training.

What really works for me is telling myself that one binge won't make things as worse as I think in the moment. I also tell myself that purging or restricting is just tryig to find a quick way out of that feeling and it will not help for the long run.

What I have read and seen in others is that once you have a certain calorie level for maintaing, I try to even it out for relative short periods of time, fx a week. Try thinking about the spoon theory, at least it works for me. It helps me be more considerate about the food resources i have or prep for. Also binging and purging cand get expensive quite fast (this is another motivator for me).

Sorry if it doesn't make much sense. I'm on my phone and half way asleep.

Also go see a doctor! I am in no way qualified to give actual medical/therapy advice.",rosey__11,1568250073.0,2019-09-11 20:01:13,"1. I would go visit a dietitian for sure. A dietitian would really be able to come up with a special plan just for you.
2. I agree with the other posts the weight is most likely water weight. However I would really recommend getting rid of the scale all together. It’s not necessary to weigh yourself super often.
3. Starvation mode isn’t a thing. It’s a myth. It’s also not bad to eat late at night. Everyone has a different schedule it’s okay to eat based on your own schedule. 
4. With bulimia again I would recommend throwing out the scale. Seriously. Throw it in the trash. I would try to stick to a plan that works for you. For example have 3 spaced out meals (or 2) everyday(go to visit MyPlate online for a visual of what your plates should look like) and have two snacks in between meals. This might help you prevent binges. Just focus on building your plate in a healthy way don’t worry about what the scale says.
5. Also I think it’s awesome you are really trying to recover. I feel like during the recovery process it’s common for people to relapse. Don’t beat yourself up about any binges. Just think tomorrow is a new day and try again the next day. Don’t get discouraged during the process.

this happened to me when i tried to go to therapy for restricting and picking at my skin. she just made me feel like i as a traumatized little kid and that just sent me spiraling. and that was all she talked to me about. what a stupid label. ""trauamtized child."" it felt like, what a nice choice of box to put me in!

And then I told her, ""i do not like this traumatized child label"" and instead of, idk, changing, she was like ""well, let's talk about why you take issue with being referred to in that way,"" ""why don't you want to be vulnerable"" and just would not stop! 

i ended up forgetting about therapy all together, so idk if i am a perfect source of advice, but based on what my friends have told me abt their therapy experiences: i would start calling (or emailing) other therapists, explicitly explain what problem you ran into the previous time, and emphasizing that you need someone with a different approach.

Good luck and stay strong— truly, I hope it works out!!",NeedyPudding,1568135787.0,2019-09-10 12:16:27,"I 100% respect what the person before me said, it's a genuinely valid solution to look for a new therapist if this one insists on labeling you in a way that you feel is damaging to your mental health. Truly, it is.  


Having said that, before reaching out to new people, I would do 2 things:

1. Try and talk about this with your therapist. Most therapists tend to be reasonable and perfectly willing to course-correct to suit the client. Maybe you'll even reach some new perspectives together that way, instead of having to start the whole process over with a new therapist. You can do this via email, too, to start things off. ;)
2. Ask yourself why you associate 'food addiction' and 'binge eating disorder' with being called fat. I don't feel like either your doctor or your therapist said or even implied anything of the sort. I'm a recovering anorexic, among many other things. It's purely anecdotal, of course, but I would 100% call myself a food addict. I would argue that the more my disorder took hold, the more obsessed with food I became. One does not necessarily negate the other. Even on track I am so mindful of what I eat and so focused on what I'll eat next that it still manifests a lot like food addiction. The important thing to remember is that most known eating disorders have some degree of overlap. For example, from my own experience I find that the guilt spirals after eating, especially if a person is on phentermine, are indicative of a binge eating disorder. But you could be right in thinking it may be another disorder altogether. It's just important to remember that food addiction is also a disorder, just as valid as any of the others; and there's no 'look' to any of the EDs. Most friends of mine who've been diagnosed with BED are quite slim, and the disorder usually manifested during or even after significant weight loss. Also, I just personally feel like it's the nature of a disorder to not completely vanish on its own in a period of months just because you've lost weight. If you feel you had food addiction 8 months ago, it's probably still there in some form. I was diagnosed with EDNOS, and then it got changed to OSFED, then it was anorexia (binge-purge subtype). All I feel has really changed between those 3 is the name. My eating disorder has always been an eating disorder. My toxic relationship with food has always been my toxic relationship with food. A diagnosis for me is merely a sort of shorthand therapists use, and usually it's more for their own benefit, or for the benefit of healthcare/insurance provider than a comment on your shape or size.

A dietician is only involved if you've forgotten what a good portion size or healthy food is like.  
And I'd advise you to go to a therapist specialised in eating disorders. Otherwise it can be very hard.

Usually you'll only go into inpatient if it's really severe or if you have another problem.

I was inpatient for another issue as well and they ignored my ED and basically let me not eat anything and I was passing out and they told my parents that they didn’t have to do anything about my lack of eating, as long as I wasn’t “really sick”. It was messed up.

But just because your ED presents ‘atypically’ doesn’t mean it’s not valid or you shouldn’t seek help. In fact, quite a percentage of people with EDs use it as a form of self-harm tool in depression. Sometimes the restriction of food is a form of coping mechanism for trauma patients, and it’s not about body image at all. 

I guess it’s about seeking a doctor who will take your concerns seriously, and from there gain a trusted psychologist. Please take care of yourself.",immitations,1568061194.0,2019-09-09 15:33:14,"Your councilors are wrong in saying that you don't have Anorexia/an Eating Disorder because you lack body image issues. Eating Disorders are a mental problem but you don't always have to have body hate or a want to lose weight. Weight loss/gain is just a visible sign of an Eating Disorder (if that makes sense). For example my ED started as a lack of control in my life, and controlling what I ate, when I ate and whether not to eat helped me cope which did eventually end with body image issues, but it doesn't for everyone. Some people just focus on the control they HAVE when it comes to food, camparison to the other things they may not have control over. You having guilty feelings and thoughts towards food does indicate an Eating Disorder. Eating Disorders heavily revolve around feeling guilt after or before eating, heavy control over what you eat, and thoughts of dread when faced with having to eat around people or in general, and you thinking you don't deserve to eat, which results in not eating, is a behavior. You need to find a specialist - normal therapists/councilors are not trained in how to handle EDs and often have misconceptions about them like the rest of society. A specialist can better help you than your current therapists.
I also suggest trying to find a nutritionist to help you find a diet that works for you if you're headed toward recovery.

I just think you can call it a bad habit. You need food, everyone needs it, and bad habits revolving around food are always more problematic and concerning. Anorexia and bulimia are about how you see yourself but your case is about how you see the food itself. I think normal therapy would provide you some help for sure. 

Try to remind yourself how delicious your food is. Try doing things that you like and eat while doing it, your brain will connect the happiness with food and by time you will feel less anxiety. You don't need to start big. Eat one normal food a day while watching your favorite tv show for example. Eat with people you like in comfort. When you are happy eat something small. Those are some common tips for braking bad habits however i am by no means a professional. 

Hope this will help a little. Keep up caring for yourself. Spoil yourself. Good luck. :)",problemproblem420,1568064349.0,2019-09-09 16:25:49,YES it counts. This is my situation.

I'll give you all the advice I can. 

First off, try as hard as you can not to comment on his body and the physical changes, no matter how obvious it is. Whether it's positive, negative, or neutral, the ED will use it as fuel to go deeper. Let him know you're worried that he's struggling, and if/when he's ready or able to talk about it you'll be there. Don't expect to be able to fix it, just try to encourage him to make healthy choices, and get help. Only he can make the choice to recover, so all you can do is be supportive, remind him you love him, etc. Also keep in mind eating disorders are truly a type of coping method, so chances are there's something deeper going on and the best thing he can do is see a therapist (which may be hard depending on where you live and other factors of course), so if he's not sure where or how to get help, you can maybe try to help him find online or affordable resources. 

I hope this helps a bit 🖤",lbrc27,1568093918.0,2019-09-10 00:38:38,"Eating disorders are fucked up. The biggest thing I would recommend is avoiding commenting on his body. Like, no matter what you say - or how you say it - the eating disorder will manipulate what you're saying and twist it as motivation to continue the behaviors. Resist the urge to bully him. And I use bully as in - trying to control him to eat, or stop going to the gym. Fighting with him about his behaviors... for example ""I want you to stop!!"" eating disorders are really good at using those narratives to encourage the eating disorder because it's feeding into the hyper fixation. Mostly; the biggest thing you can do is let him know that you love him, unconditionally, and that while you acknowledge that he's struggling you don't judge him and you're here for him. And also be aware of the emotional toll it's taking on you. Being supportive of somebody with an eating disorder is very emotionally fatiguing. And sometimes you just gotta let them do their thing even if it's at the detriment of their own health. You can't ""force"" somebody to recover, but you can let them know that if they choose to do so - you await with open arms.",lavender_dreams1,1568117367.0,2019-09-10 07:09:27,"I love him so much, he’s been so incredible to me, he’s helped me get the help I needed with my own ED and mental health issues, and now I want to help him.

Thank you for your advice, I know how I feel when people comment on my eating habits and how it fuels the urge to eat even more, so I’m trying really really hard not to mention his lack of food and excessive exercise, but it’s so heartbreaking to see. 

We live in the UK so therapy can be free on the NHS or you can pay for it, and I’ve told him that I could drive him to therapy and wait for him outside, etc, if needed.

Are you feeling hungry before you eat? Do you get uncomfortably full after? What are your emotions when you're eating - guilty, sad, angry, happy, stressed, etc?

What works for me is taking whatever I want to binge on, cut it into small portions, and then eat it bit by a bit over a period of time.

Yeah, this kinda thing is really tricky. First off, I know it's really hard, but shoving aside thoughts like

&gt;I won't lie and say that changing my appearance and my unhappiness about looking overweight aren't motivations at all, though.

is super important when it comes to EDs. And those are hard to shake because they do feel, in the moment, like really good motivators. But the unfortunate reality is that your eyes can play tricks on you. I can't tell you how many times my eyes told me one thing, but my bloodwork ended up revealing the inverse.

Eating better and setting up a fitness plan for the sake of make your body healthier is the one thing you can truly bank one. If you don't have access to a nutritionist, make sure that you source information from places that are reputable when building out what you're gonna plan on eating. And stick to that plan. If you happen to miss a work out because you had to stay late at work, don't cut back on your dinner, etc. Also, if you own a scale? Throw it out. That thing is just gonna get in the way.

Another piece of advice is, if you aren't already speaking to a therapist, I highly recommend you find one. Talk therapy can be hugely helpful in terms of having someone to regularly check in with, view your situation objectively, and help you pluck out triggers to prevent you from backsliding into disordered behaviors.

Above all, be patient with yourself. Transitioning back into eating deliberately and exercising is always gonna be hard, but you _can do it._ Feel free to DM me with questions if anything I said doesn't make sense!",doghouse1988,1568690760.0,2019-09-16 22:26:00,"There’s a lot I could say, but here’s a few tidbits of advice: 

1. Set an exercise limit 
2. Aim for movement, fun, and sweating without an agenda. Stay focused on how exercise makes you feel. Listen to your body when you need to slow down, push yourself when you had a hard day and need to let it out. Try fun things. Try new things. Don’t be rigid. If you sense you’re going to the gym out of shame or guilt, maybe go on a walk instead of going to the cycling class to get moving but be gentle and set boundaries with yourself. 
3. Moderate weight lifting is not really for weight loss but can be really empowering and help you to feel strong. Incorporate that into the routine if you want. 
4. Exercise burns calories. It will make you hungry. If you need an extra snack, eat it. If you are going from no activity to moderate activity, your metabolism is gonna jump. When I started working out again after recovery I was ravenously hungry. If your body really needs to lose weight, listening to your hunger and fullness cues and not ignoring your hunger will probably lead you to your body’s set point/true weight. This weight might be higher than you anticipated, but you will feel satisfied and strong. At least, that’s how I feel. I’m not my skinniest, but I rarely obsess over food anymore. Doesn’t even cross my mind until I’m hungry.",SupSquark,1568703939.0,2019-09-17 02:05:39,"I was living on an ungodly number of calories per day (very, very few) but I always loved running, even before my eating disorder. I realised that when I ate more I could run better, so I gained the weight but, naturally, it came on as fat because I'd gained in such a short space of time.

I'm now maintaining (on anywhere between 1800-2500 calories per day) and getting fitter and healthier; this is what works for me:

1. I see running/lifting as a privilege. When I wasn't fuelled I couldn't do it and now that I eat I've gone from barely running 5km in January to running half marathons and having a weekly distance of 40km. Food is fuel.

2. Everything is meticulously planned (a rule I'm hoping to eventually relax). That means I have meals and snacks in between certain times and I know what I'm eating for them in advance.

3. Meal prep. So time efficient and also lowers the temptation not to eat or to eat something unhealthy. The meal is there waiting, all you've got to do is eat it. Also saves a lot of money buying in bulk.

4. Take it easy and don't beat yourself up. There are some days I can run forever (ran to Germany once), and other days where even 5km is a stretch. No workout is the same and you've got to listen to what your body is saying. It also helps to reflect on WHY workouts weren't great - for me it's if I've had little sleep or if I've undereaten or even if I'm distracted by something else (work, family etc.)

5. Allow treats! I eat chocolate every day because I like it. Because I'm not restricting anything, my body is content and not fighting against me so I never get the urge to eat everything that I used to get when refeeding.

I have plenty more but I think those are the main things. Best of luck!

I would say the goal in ED isn't hitting This Exact BMI, it's restoring your relationship with food. Once you're eating as much as your body needs, it will eventually restore to your set point. It's likely you will go over the BMI you were when you start gaining weight  but as things even out and your body realises you're not starving any more it will settle back to your set point, which for you could be a naturally lower BMI",Akka1805,1568629168.0,2019-09-16 05:19:28,"Basically what the other commenter said - most people if they were adults when their ED/relapse started end up stabilising at a weight that's right around where they were before, but getting to that exact weight isn't worth stressing over. With AN particularly people will usually overshoot their 'setpoint' weight and stay at that higher weight for a bit, but then slowly lose to get back to that setpoint. The people saying it's unrealistic to maintain a lowish BMI while recovering may have been talking about that overshoot (or their own experience maybe, most adults won't naturally be right at the lower end of the healthy BMI range), but the reality is that if you were legitimately slim before your ED without engaging in disordered behaviours you're likely to be slim post-recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And really, as long as we are reasonably healthy and eat more plants and less sugar and move around at least a little, the number on the scale or the tag of our clothing isn’t any indication of our value or worth. Having friends of many body sizes can help a lot with this. Try and remind yourself that you would never condition a friendship on body size (and if you would, ask yourself why that is). Almost all people with ED that I’ve ever spoken to are protective of their friends’ self-image, including size, and of their relationships with food. Personally, I remind my friends often that food is not a moral choice and can be both fuel and an occasional pleasure. In other words, many of us try to discourage our friends from applying unhealthy/disordered ideas about food. If you don’t, try and recognize it and be compassionate to your friends when they do. 

Then, apply that same standard to yourself. Treat yourself with the gentleness and compassion you give your friends. Talk to yourself in the third person if you need to. Say the same words to yourself that you say to other people. Write them down if you need them.

Same goes for telling a counselor/nurse. If you know her family situation is bad, or are unsure, tread lightly and be careful of adults calling CPS or emergency services.

It's different for everyone but for the first few months of recovery I didn't feel ""accomplished"" or ""strong"" at all, I just felt tired of fighting and irritated at how difficult it was physically and mentally. It took me about 4 months to feel a bit more ""Yayy!!"" about it, and it has generally been uphill from there though not without setbacks. 

I actually remember voicing to a few close friends at about the 2.5 month mark that I felt like nothing was getting better and all the bad thoughts were still there and they said ""it's been less than 3 months, you only recently took a huge step into recovery, accepting that you have a problem so you can't expect it to go away straight away""..

Side note: It does get easier! Try your best to make sure your recovery is full and not quasi so try not to hang onto little habits because I found that they stopped me from having that ""yay"" factor and it fucks with you in the long term.

I also wish that, when I had said things about how uncomfortable I was in my body, they would have said “you are so healthy” or “as long as you feel good and energetic you are fine” rather than just reassuring me that I was skinny, because these only reinforces my obsession with body weight. I also don’t recall a time in my life where others would compliment me on my accomplishments rather than my appearance... they meant well but I think this puts the focus of young people in the wrong place.

I also wish they had told me certain habits were NOT okay. I stopped eating lunch when I was in middle school and my friends told my mom- but she didn’t do enough at the time to intervene. She could have supported me just by helping me pack one, because even that would have dignified that it mattered and also instilled a healthier habit.

I wish meals had been social and transparent at home. A lot of people in my house got home at different times so ate dinner separately.

But I also realize that may not be an option for you.

Many people will have different opinions, but here is my suggestion, based on my experience (coming from working with a certified nutritionist/trainer). Try to focus on nutritionally dense foods with minimal processing. Good options include any kind of fruit or vegetable (I like bananas, dark greens like kale and spinach); nuts and seeds; oats; and, if possible, high protein dairy. Consider looking at the types of diets utilized by athletes for muscle building. 

Good meal options might include:
1) oatmeal or steel cut oats with peanut or almond butter and raisins or banana;
2) Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts or granola;
3) granola bars (really any are okay, but you can make your own or buy the ones that have more nuts and less sugar);
4) protein or meal bars (20+ grams of protein is a good amount);
5) chicken, if you like it, but keep the spices on the more bland side until you can tolerate it; and
6) cheese and dairy. Go for whole milk, if you like it. 
7) whole grain toast with peanut butter and banana, or two thick slices of toast with eggs and butter—can’t beat it!!
8) protein shakes and smoothies (fruit and yogurt) can be good ways to add in nutrition when you don’t feel like eating. I buy protein powder from the grocery store; it isn’t necessary to buy the super expensive stuff. 
9) avocado is a fantastic source of healthy fats and of course, it tastes delicious. Oftentimes I’ll eat one as part of my breakfast with just salt, pepper, and a spoon. 

100% Whole grain breads and pastas, as well as high protein pasta like soybean and edamame pasta, can also be good options, as are beans — just make sure you use canned or soak the beans first if you cook them, to cut back on gas. Eggs are a good source of nutrition, so if you like them, eat them!

I suggest you stay away from refined sugars (think candy, sweets, cereal) and refined flours (like white bread). There’s nothing wrong with enjoying them if you want to, but every time I do, I notice that I’m hungry shortly thereafter and tend to overeat, then I feel sick the next day. But if I eat about 80% healthy, I’m rarely hungry and can generally trust that when I’m hungry, it’s because I need to eat.

Don’t force yourself to eat something that doesn’t sound appetizing. Be gentle on yourself. 

It’s important for you to go slow. Your body needs time to adjust to physical changes. Don’t overeat because you might have so much pain that you give up (this has happened to me way too often!). Focus on eating small but frequent meals until you can adjust to more calories (when the nausea goes away).",covhr,1569403985.0,2019-09-25 04:33:05,"in terms of the physical pain, you might have a touch of gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying). It's not uncommon in people recovering from anorexia. 

Talk to your doctor, you might be able to get a (short term) prescription for Reglan (metoclopromide), which aids in speeding digestion and reducing nausea.

I don't have much advice, except that potentially, you could try to save up for a consultation with a therapist who DOES specialize in ed, and have a focus on getting materials (pamphlets, books) that you and your normal therapist cam use as a guide to see if she cam at least be more helpful in the realm of ED.

There's a lot of exercises on YouTube that don't require for you to jump, or use any equipment. Can't do jumping jacks? Just do them workout jumping, etc.

About the food issue, it's important to know the nutritional value of foods. Brussel sprouts, for example, are very high in fibre, so if you eat a bunch of them, you'll end up running to the bathroom. Make sure you have protein, carbs, veggies, fruits, and fats in your meals. I suggest you do meal prep. Take a day in the week to make meals for the whole week, with their correct portions and everything, then store them in the freezer. If you don't like the state of preheated chicken, you can just submergenthe chicken in 1/2 cup of white vinegar and 1 cup of water for 10 to 15 minutes.

If so, you can accompany it with some pediasure, rice porrige, or soup, something light that does not require for you to chew, but still get the nutrients you need. I suggest you freezing some soup for those times of need, so that you don't have to cook (I advice you to make your soup yourself, since store bought soups contain too much sodium). And, if you're feeling a bit better after eating that, you can treat yourself with something that you like  (like a reward for overcoming those emotions).

What works best for me when it comes to encouraging or remind myself to eat in general though is to make sure that I have food and snacks at home that are either easy and quick to cook, or that I've prepared some smaller meals or snacks beforehand (usually in the morning) that I just can take out from the fridge and eat during the day...I try to have cottage cheese, hummus and other similar foods at home that are easy to combine with vegetables/fruits etc to make a more balanced meal with little effort. 

It can also be good to try and think about why you feel like it's pointless to feed yourself too, because your body needs food to work properly, so why are you taking that away from yourself in times of stress (a time when you need it more than ever)?

The nourishment from food also made me more sexually attracted to people, which I hadn't felt for a while. 

It's difficult, but definitely worth it. I often think about what my life would've been like if I made the decision to stick with anorexia. I would've remained a slave to stress and negative thoughts, and would have very little if any time for enjoying life the way it's meant to be enjoyed. I remember many days just forcing myself to eat, and it sucked. But there were also times where it was extremely satisfying, where I felt a rush of new feelings enter my experience, where I felt like someone new, someone I was working toward.

Now my days aren't spent thinking about how to avoid social situations or exercising to lose weight. I can embrace the time I have with people without worrying about myself. That's something everyone will realize when they get older: That they're glad they spent time with the people they're close to, or that they should've spent more time with those people.

My advice would be eat a few small meals regularly throughout the day, if you don't have the appetite for full meals. Not only will it help maintain your weight, it means your body will physically be satiated so you won't run the risk of binge urges.

Try to keep in mind all the positives you've gained from being stable and healthy - all the mental and physical benefits and what you've been able to achieve during recovery.

Yes this could be a slippery slope if you let it be, but the self awareness you have and the fact that you have reached out for help early is a really good sign, and that you're willing to make changes to prevent yourself from getting worse!

You do not need to disclose your eating disorder to your employer, it is an illness just like anything else. However, you are welcome to if you feel comfortable. For me, I set up a meeting and in an email gave a vague explanation that it was regarding my current health and I needed to discuss it with him. I ultimately decided to disclose that it was due to an eating disorder and luckily my boss was very supportive and kind. I was able to take 6 weeks off and it wasn't a problem. He told me my health should always come before the company.

If you are concerned about jeopardizing your job, you can always look into FMLA - family and medical leave - to help ensure you can keep your job. Or even use vacation days if needed. You said your boss is understanding so hopefully that won't even be a problem. Remember your boss is human and understands that things come up in life. I reminded myself that my boss would probably rather have me gone for a month right now than have me gone for several months down the road because I didn't take care of the issue earlier.

I started this with meditation and yoga, which helped train me to stop my brain from running. Focusing on nothing, feeling sensations or feelings and letting them go is really soothing. 

That helps with anxiety, to be able to say ""alright we're not going to think about this anymore."" And focusing on letting it go. For negative thoughts, I also work on retraining how I talk to myself. So whenever I catch myself saying something mean to me, I stop and take a moment to rephrase it to myself, focusing less on the negative and more on what I can do next time to make it better. 

Tw tw for negative self talk: 

So in this example, you overate and drank, you probably feel overly stuffed (ie physically uncomfortable). I'd be thinking ""I'm not helping how fat I look by stuffing my face like this. How could I let myself eat do much again?"" 

So this is pretty negative. At some point I stop the narrative, saying to myself ""wait, I decided I'm going to be nicer to myself. I ate and drank so much because I was celebrating a birthday, and I had a really good time doing that. I'm uncomfortable with how full I am so next time I'm going to try eating less and bringing home leftovers."" 

Which I know seems like an impossible task right now. Like I said, it took me a long time and a ton of practice to get to this point where I can decide whether or not I want to think about something and how I talk to myself, and sometimes I slip up and let my thoughts get the better of me.

For example, yeah I was smaller then, but I don’t have swollen, sore glands from purging anymore now. I used to have pretty bad skin, too, and felt exhausted and miserable pretty much constantly.

 last night, I was torturing myself by going through old photos and comparing my size in them (why I do this to myself I don’t know...) I have to remind myself that the body I had back then came with a whole bunch of other negatives, and it does make me feel grateful for the way my body is now.",SKHLEL,1570776148.0,2019-10-11 01:42:28,"If there’s anyone you have in your life that you’re close enough to, think about how your self image affects them. 

For example, I spend a lot of time tearing myself down, saying I’m fat, hating my skin, hair, etc. However whenever I say these things about myself, my husband ends up feeling guilty for it, and spends the next however many hours trying to convince me that I’m wrong. And that in turn just makes me feel guilty for wasting someone else’s time like that, but it’s not a bad guilt. It’s good to know that my self image is so flawed that it makes other people sad. And before I was married, I had similar situations with my mom and best friends. It’s not just you, it’s everyone else that feels the effects of your image, and it’s something that is so easily managed when you start to realize that you have different people who don’t even see what you see so clearly. This makes it easier over time to recognize that this horrible image is just in your head.",Jammertal17,1571180788.0,2019-10-15 18:06:28,"this isn’t strictly related to EDs but giving myself positive reinforcement has really helped me be kinder in my self-talk, which has helped with my depression and makes it easier to break out of a self-destructive thought cycle.

Something that had helped me recently is telling myself “Good Job” after doing a task, no matter how silly/small/inconsequential, like I’m giving positive reinforcement to a toddler for picking up their toys. If I brush my teeth? Good Job! Get to work on time? Good Job! Smooth out my blankets in the morning? Good Job! Giving myself a pat on the back for doing things gives me motivation to do more things. Focusing on little actionable items helps to distract me from stewing in my own self-hatred.

Lemme say it for the people in the back: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE THIN TO QUALIFY FOR AN EATING DISORDER. You are using extreme measures surrounding your eating and they are obviously distressing you. That’s all the qualification you need. Please see a school counselor at your campus mental health center. It is extremely common for eating disorders to start in college, this is something they will have experience in. You need to see a professional, it is very difficult to stop the cycle on your own.",Nut-Loaf,1570546610.0,2019-10-08 09:56:50,"Talk to a counselor. Eating disorders are not just about being thin or fat, it’s primarily about the behaviors. Therapists and doctors will help you cope with your behaviors and talk with others about your situation. There are various other things they will help you with (normally about trauma or your past since ED’s usually occur from trauma), but their main focus are your behaviors. You may think being fat invalidates you just like an anorexic person thinks they are healthy and thus attempts to invalidate themselves. But this way of thinking is among the behaviors of an eating disorder. And honestly it’s a way of thinking even trauma survivors can have. It’s necessary that you see a health professional immediately.

There are multiple reasons why an eating disorder can develop from trauma, but the essential and consistent reason why someone with PTSD, for example, would develop an eating disorder is because it is a coping mechanism. Trauma can cause immense psychological pain  and your brain will create a self-defense mechanism to combat the negative feelings and pain someone is experiencing. Some individuals can have anger problems due to trauma. Some individuals can suffer from depression and use self-harm methods to relieve the pain from trauma. Similarly, an eating disorder can develop as a coping mechanism to combat the psychological pain. An anorexic will refuse to eat because they feel better about themselves when they never eat (very simplified by the way). While growing up, they may have experienced trauma that negatively affected their self-image or destroyed their self-esteem. These can be potential reasons why they developed an eating disorder. Trauma is complex and requires a professional to help you piece your past together.

I have talked to my school’s counselors, but I had bad experiences. One time I got told “well, he’s being taken care of and we’re busy helping student’s deal with finals stress right now so...” and they sent me home with a list of providers in the area. I am super indecisive and I had a panic attack just trying to google names on the list. My boyfriend was admitted into a psychiatric hospital on suicide watch during finals week and I was only able to visit for 45 min a day once a day. I went because I needed help and it really hurt when they brushed me off like that. Another time I went because I was just plain suicidal and the guy (different counselor) just tried to get me to say it and I wouldn’t, and I just sat there and cried my eyes out for 45 min and was sent on my way. The man was nice, he just seemed very tired. I went in at the end of the day. No idea how exhausting his day must have been.

After being overweight for the longest part of my life, I started losing weight three years ago, I also added some weight lifting into my routine two years ago and it did wonders for me!  
Slowly I'm losing the loathed excess fat while being around the same (healthy) weight. So I'd suggest trying that out over a longer period of time (one year minimum). More muscle means a higher basal metabolic rate und thus more energy expenditure. It's also really fun to be stronger.   
But consider that you need to eat properly!

Also, please consider that working on your physique is a long process. Disordered habbits don't help.",Toast_in_the_Toaster,1570546712.0,2019-10-08 09:58:32,"BMI is bullshit. You said yourself that you are pretty muscular and BMI does not account for this whatsoever, it is simply a ratio between your height and weight. A person who has a very low % body fat will still be considered ""overweight"". Do not use this scale to determine your health. Unless you've had a doctor telling you to lose weight because you are not healthy, then you don't have to worry. 
Your body changes a lot as you become an adult and every body carries weight differently. Your weight right now could very well be the place that your body is happy. 

Your concerns are perfectly valid and your mom is wrong for telling you how your body should look and I'm sorry you've had to deal with someone telling you your body isn't good enough. Those kind of words from a loved one are extremely hard to cope with. 

The most important thing is that you are healthy and happy. It doesn't matter what anyone else in your life has to say about it. If you're concerned about your body, talk to a professional. They will have more knowledge about what is right for you and are more trustworthy sources than yourself or your family. If you want to change your body, there are healthier ways to do so that don't involve excessive exercise and restriction. But consult someone first.

A few years ago I lost a lot of weight (I was 70 kg) doing a really hard diet, but it was harder to keep that weight. The funny thing back then I used to have a “healthy BMI”, at the end I ended having bulimia in an attempt to keep that weight. I was in recovery for a year and I feel I have a better relationship with food and my body. I understood that it’s better to be healthy with some extra kilograms. I know as well my body likes the weight I have now (81 again and on overweight BMI). I get so frustrated when I try to lose some kilograms (2-3) just to feel better with my body, but it’s like my body resist to it. I wonder why most of my friend just cut some cravings (cookies, beer, chips) and lose weight so easily! While I do exercise and eat very healthy and nothing happens.

If you’re attempting to look more traditionally masculine, focusing on weight lifting. Would highly suggest finding a trainer who is some knowledge of EDs and trans issues (not an easy task, I know).

This also meant that I had to (temporarily) devote more time to my recovery than to my actual classwork, and my grades reflect that. However, I am glad that I remained in school. If I were to have taken a semester off, I think I would have felt even more isolated than I did when my ED was at its peak. Do what works for you, but that's just my experience. (p.s. I'm now a college senior, fully recovered, excited to graduate on time in May)",sincereenfuego,1570480881.0,2019-10-07 15:41:21,"Hi friend! 

So, regardless if this psych diagnoses you with AN, EDNOS, or maybe just disordered eating, the fact that YOU yourself had reservations about your eating and lifestyle and think that there might be some cause for concern shows that treatment might be good for you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was just discharged from treatment that long ago for treatment of an eating disorder, as well as some other things, but when I met with my first intake director for the program I was contacting, they diagnosed me with EDNOS because I was no longer underweight (had been prior, but through the want of recovery had started my own weight restoration). I then entered the program, which had multiple locations, and when I started at the location closest to me, the psych, therapist, and dietician all agreed that the diagnosis was AN. So even if this psych you are seeing gives you one thing, it is important to know how you feel and maybe that seeking a second opinion could be beneficial.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I know how it feels to be scared to put your life on hold for treatment. I had to leave my job of five years so I could do my treatment, but I don't regret a moment of it since I am now 6 weeks free of ED behaviors and have never felt more alive and better. It is important to remember that your life will still be waiting for you after treatment, but living without treatment is not conducive to living in the long term. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, I wish you the best and cannot tell you how proud I am that you are seeking treatment! It is scary, but it is worth it and you are worth it! Good luck friend!

I am happy to assist in any way I can!",bflowry,1570495672.0,2019-10-07 19:47:52,It’s very hard to put your life on hold to enter treatment. I can attest to this.

I began treatment a month ago after talking to a GP and they refered me to a therapist and a dietitian/nutritionist (I haven't met the dietitian yet but will in about a week due to there being no earlier appointments available) so I guess that depending on your situation it could be a good idea to ask for one. 

My therapist has contacted the eating disorder unit at the local hospital in my town but she told me that the waiting time there could be long or that they won't take my case (I don't know what criterias they have for patients), so I would suggest that you ask a GP or search if there are any units like that where you live that you perhaps can contact directly. 

I also had the issue with not knowing how much to eat (I haven't gotten that much guidance about that actually) so I just began tracking my calories with an app to see how much calories I had been eating approximately before (note: I never stopped eating completely but had restrictive amounts of meals everyday) and then I started adding more calories every day and try to eat the daily recommended intake/what the body needs to maintain everyday at least.  

I didn't feel comfortable doing this at all, having the same worries as you, so I would really really suggest to try and see if there's any sort of support that you can find or if your GP can check up on you weekly or something because it all really depends on what state you're in. (I really do hope someone else here can give you an better answer/solution, because I really don't know.)

When it comes to being scared that you'll have recovered by the time the waiting list is up...I talked to my therapist about this when she told me about the ED unit at the hospital and waiting time and I said something like ""what if I have recovered by then"" and she told me that ""if you're recovered by then it's a good thing"". But I think it's very important that regardless if you have recovered or not you should still talk to them if you feel like you're struggling in any way. If you tell them that you need help, they should help you.

And please don't restrict more. I know how you feel but you really need to support yourself right now, hurting yourself more won't solve anything. (Even though it hurts a lot to heal...I've felt ill many times now after eating or just been an emotional wreck about it all but we have to continue forward.) Please hang in there &lt;3",houston_veronica,1570399397.0,2019-10-06 17:03:17,"Hi Op. I have had AN for 14 total years, and am in recovery as of June 2018...still working on it.

I would say that the idea of recovering before you get more help is a lovely impossibility. I won't say it as ""law"" because every person is different, but EDs are a disease of the mind. I see them as a sort of pandora's box -- once you know how an ED impacts your thinking, it is very, very hard to go back to how you used  to be.  I know of no person in my real life who has beaten AN to where they have left behind all the thoughts and every single behavior. I only know people who have made excellent recoveries, and will always identify as ""in recovery"".

Those people have gone on to live fulfilling lives, but even they -in their most brilliant recovery progress - have moments that they struggle and still need to check in with themselves or even a counselor. BTW, I am referring to people like my own counselors and therapists, who are actually helping me/my peers.

So here is my point: I wish like crazy that you could actually recover that quickly, but reality - sadly - is far from that. Additionally, your concerns are valid, but let me say: I was near death, even if I didn't recognize it. The weight I was (for my height) would astound anyone. However, I never had gastroperesis, nor did I have refeeding syndrome. The trick was that I went to professionals to help me, and they knew exactly what to do.

When I was inpatient, I recall my first 1-2 weeks being jealous (lol) that other patients had MORE food because, hell, I was hungry and I thought that I was going to be able to eat more! But my wise RD and drs knew exactly how to start my nutrition plan, so that I would not have any adverse reactions. They were always, always monitoring my heart, my BP, my weight, my fluids...they left NOTHING to chance. I was also tubed, with a feeding tube - and as painful as that was, it too helped me eat more without having to sit down to a trough of mass portions that would just set me up to fail after leaving treatment. 

Bottom line: if you can get professional help, do that, and make this your top priority...nothing else matters until you get safely to recovery and continue to pursue it. I think that you are at risk of always being in the ED mindset, as much as I hate to say this -- because EDs are just horrible that way. They are mental, you didn't ask for it, and you cannot be guilty for it.

Please eat what you can, eat often or as much as you want. IMO, it is better to eat too much than too little. Don't worry about amounts right now - your RD will help you. There is little you can do to cause permanent problems...my metabolism is just fine and that was after 14 years.  God bless you (sorry if offensive) and I'm pulling for you and all the others reading this. You can do this.",_gkr,1570399999.0,2019-10-06 17:13:19,"Ask for your GP to have some blood work done.  It can help in seeing any vitamin or mineral deficiencies that can start to be taken care of.  I also got blood work done to make sure I wasn't pregnant (since I lost my period), and even got an electrocardiogram done to make sure my heart was still doing okay. It's nice to cover all your bases.

Requesting to see a dietician or nutritionist is a great start-they're more knowledgeable on how to help with your dietary/gastric concerns.  Requesting to see one can absolutely be beneficial. If not a dietician, ask if there are any eating disorder services provided where you are located.  This may also help you while you wait to see a counselor.  I was lucky to get sent to my local hospital that provided me with a team of nurses, dieticians, therapists, and more to help me.  I never even knew about it, so it was a nice surprise.  Asking about any local services/programs can be a nice start to your road to recovery. 

I would say to still go to a counselor even though you feel like you're recovered.  It's nice to talk things out with someone and share what your experiences have been like so far. It's surprising how much lighter you feel after venting (and crying) it all out.  I find it's a safe place to go to where I know I'm not going to be judged, and can say and talk freely about anything. I've come out with new ways to cope if I have a bad day, and exercises to do to help with my peace of mind.

I understand that you feel like restricting right now, but I wanted to let you know that you don't have to be 'sick' to go talk to a counselor.  I can also understand it's scary because you don't know what food will possibly to do you. All I can tell you to do is look into resources in your area, do your research, reach out to friends, family, even people on this subreddit who have been through this scary process.

Also remember that when the time comes and if you *feel* recovered, you should still go to counselling because the likelihood of relapsing is high, particularly if you've physically gotten better on your own.

Do request bloodtests. I had a few and an ECG which detected a very low heart rate and deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B and iron; that really helped me to research the right foods to be eating so I could fix these (because supplements are pricey). I was told that despite looking relatively healthy, my heart rate put me at risk of death at any moment which was quite a motivation to eat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1073,ddlg4j,wishfulmelody,1570279697.0,2019-10-05 07:48:17,"I began treatment about a month ago (meeting with a therapist a few times and I'm seeing a nutritionist soon) and I didn't even realize until I started that I was so afraid to admit to myself that I have an eating disorder and have struggled with it on and off for years. I think it's because I didn't really want to confront the idea that I've been hurting myself all this time, and that the control that I thought I had wasn't control at all. (I tried to be healthy but didn't realize that I developed really unhealthy behaviours.)

And even one month into treatment I'm still afraid, but it's okay. We're human, not robots. I have had slight relapses here and there and I get really impatient and frustrated sometimes...it's hard. I've been an emotional mess in general, but I've realized that it's probably really good that all these feelings come to the surface because you can't heal until you admit that you're hurt. 

My advice to you is to seek the support you need (probably the easiest way to do so is through your therapist) as soon as you're able to, but to also not be too hard on yourself when your fears stop you. 

I learnt through a book that my therapist recommended me (sadly not available in english) that one important step in recovery is to see two paths in front of you where one says ""more of the same"" and the other can say basically anything. Everytime you do as your fears tell you, you walk the path of ""more of the same"" which makes you go in a circle. So try and ask yourself everytime a thought comes up (or a fear) if following that thought or fear will result in ""more of the same"" or lead you somewhere new and nicer (or just somewhere different, can be something neutral). And if they tell you that it will be ""more of the same"", ask yourself if you really want that or if there's somewhere else you would rather go.

It can be difficult to make big changes in these behaviours though so focus on small tasks and victories. Take one step at a time, and it's okay to take a step back every now and then when you get overwhelmed as long as you continue to walk forward. Remember that progress isn't linear.

I don't know if this was helpful, but hang in there ok? You're not alone in this, and I wish you all the best.&lt;3",calmchusen,1570285464.0,2019-10-05 09:24:24,"The only sound piece of advice I can give you is that you NEED to push past your discomfort or you will regret it for the rest of your life (okay that last bit is a little melodramatic but you get my point). You are not alone in the way you feel. I have yet to meet someone who entered recovery headfirst purely off their own enthusiastic consent (l'm sure these people do exist. but they are a rarity). Everybody understands the absolute feeling of helplessness you're feeling because its a perfectly normal reaction to finally facing one of the most destructive coping mechanism to ever exist. Eating disorders are almost like a drug, and you're addicted. You can't expect not to go through withdrawals. 

That does not mean, however, that you should allow yourself to give into your disordered temptations. I started recovering in 2017 and I did a crap job of it. I let myself cave into my warped temptations in hopes of a small feeling of comfort. I skipped snacks and cut down meals when I felt even slightly bad about myself. I have never regretted something more in my life. I wish I could turn back time and force myself to stay devoted to my meal plan and just force myself to keep pushing. I regret it so damn much. It would’ve saved me two more years of tears and suffering. 

You need to do this for yourself. It’s hard to see it because you’re still ass deep in your disorder, but this is no way to live. You will be BEYOND grateful that you put in the work to build the life that you deserve. The time will pass whether or not you want it to, so don’t let your disorder consume any more of it.

Just a peice of science; when you restrict calories you take away the energy your brain needs to function properly and produce rational thoughts. This is why people whose bodies are in starvation mode are often very moody, irritable, and have thoughts of wanting to lose more weight or stating they ""don't care"" when doctors tell them their organs are shutting down or family members are expressing concern about the visibility of bones. I'm not saying you are this bad, you didnt go into that detail, but I am saying the more you deprive yourself of energy, the worse your mood and more irritational your thoughts will be. 

After feeding rehabilitation, many time people will look at their old pictures when they were severely underweight and express thoughts like ""I can't believe I thought I should lose more"". After they were nutritionally rehabilitated, maybe 20-30 pounds heavier, they will say they feel like they look better than ever. 

Your anxiety and concern is part of your eating disorder, a result of your starved brain. Once you consume proper nutrition, these thoughts should calm down immensely.

I have had some similar fears as you described just now and I know that feeling too well and it's awful.  I've experienced it a bit now in treatment (because I'm afraid that I'll get ill and I'll mess up my progress) but I try to calm myself down and just make sure to communicate with myself (what I'm afraid of and what I need) and accept the feelings of anxiety/stress/etc so that I can move on (basically just acknowledge that they're there but then let them come and go. Because fighting them can be a never ending battle, and I should focus on taking care of myself right now).

It's also important to think about short term versus long term solutions, because the short term solution to not eat something may seem like the best solution to relieve the anxiety just in that moment of fear, but the long term effects of that choice (if that's the solution you always go for when feeling stressed) won't be good.  

It will be hard to combat this when you first start (I've relapsed every now and then)  but as long as you don't beat yourself down for it and make sure to encourage and compliment yourself everytime you do manage to eat something it's ok. : ) Support is key on this tough road, and you need it from others and especially yourself.

After a period of anorexia, it is not really ""binge eating"" as we think of with BED (binge eating disorder). It's recovery eating. In fact, to my knowledge, if you \*ever\* had anorexia, even once, you are precluded from being diagnosed with BED. 

The ""willpower"" was your ED, and the fact that it's gone is a sign you're getting better. You will usually just binge as much as you need to. Any attempts to restrict will probably end up with you in a b/p cycle. I suggest checking out ""Minnie/Maud"" recovery protocols to help keep you on the path to recovery, and ideally speak to a doctor/nutritionist to monitor your (very normal and healthy) return to normal eating habits.

The fact that you have already started heading down this path is awesome, and you will doubt yourself and it will be super hard to accept some of the changes in your body, but you can do it. :D",furrybagel,1570189712.0,2019-10-04 06:48:32,As someone who’s had the same issues this was a really helpful response,tigerlily_96,1570192880.0,2019-10-04 07:41:20,"This!!

If you were to underfeed any animal for any amount of time, it would eat a larger amount than usual when food next became available. It’s an evolutionary advantage, and it happens across species... it’s just humans have the mental ability to purposely restrict, whilst you’d not see that purposeful restriction in other animals. 

If you forgot to feed your pet dog one evening, he’d be really really hungry the next morning at breakfast and he’d wolf down his food really quickly in the hope that more would be given to him. Alternatively, in the wild when animals face famine, they will eat everything they can when food is around - just in case they’re faced with another famine. 

Your body is trying to save you. It’s totally acceptable for you to eat significantly more than you have previously. Once your body learns that it isn’t in a famine scenario anymore (which will happen if you eat consistently, regularly, and don’t deprive yourself), the hunger will level off.

1. Stop restricting food in all it's forms (i.e. keto, low carb, fasting, restricting after a binge, etc). Make peace with all foods. Including the forbidden ones.
2. Eat 4 meals a day including snacks. Trust me. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and a little more. In order to stop your brain from sounding the ""WE ARE STARVING"" alarms and pumping panic hormones throughout your body,  you have to consistently feed it. If you are currently bingeing on 1000's of calories in 1 sitting, you can eat 3+ meals a day with much less consequence. Think of it as eating more to eat less.
Trust me. As soon as your brain and body trusts that it won't be deprived again, the binges WILL stop. And you will FEEL it. The food obsession/fixations will STOP. You will feel clear headed and strong.

You need to keep your health in check, not eat until you're sick
It is possible for someone with anorexia for it to transform into BED
It is healthy to refeed the body for a few months, but you should try afterwards to start eating when you are hungry and stop when you're full.

I'm happy to amend that claim if the literature says otherwise. 

While it seems like common sense, I don't think it's quite that simple. It's very hard to determine what the end point of refeeding is, especially if someone goes back and forth between restricting behaviours in recovery (which, tbh, who doesn't? I certainly did). It very much depends on the individual. Some will take longer, some won't.

People with anorexia often also don't get the normal signals to tell them when they're full or hungry, so that is difficult for them. Indeed, with both recovery eating and BED, the urge to eat doesn't at all stop once the stomach is full - I think many people can attest to that experience personally!

And I don’t think my situation is that serious to be able to go inpatient or request some other curriculum plan, because I’m not severely underweight and my health is fine-ish now. I eat now and see consuming food as taking pills. My friends know about my bad eating habits, but not ED. At this point, having suffered from it for so long, I cannot even recognize what’s right or wrong, so I’m just hoping that with dedication to recovery and mindful exposure, especially after I go to uni, I’ll be able to see my self-worth in something else other than my body and get better. 

If I weren’t in this position, I’d definitely admit myself, but... :/
Thank u for advice and honesty, cause it really hit me about the reality of situation! You also said u have other tips?☺️",Nut-Loaf,1571325835.0,2019-10-17 10:23:55,"There’s one based in Seattle called the Emily Program. You would have to most likely make a driving trip to get treatment. As for your situation, I completely understand what you’re saying. I had a friend of mine who went to college with an eating disorder. She was extremely intelligent and was majoring in math. Unfortunately, she struggled with depression that caused her to fail most of her classes. But the reason she had depression was because of her ED. Her friends were trying to convince her to seek help for her ED, but she refused and thought because she was at a healthy weight, she didn’t need treatment. She would have her good days and be very positive about herself, but for the most part, her ED would take over and cause her to engage in her ED behaviors. A lesson I learned in the past year is that ED’s are not just about weight. They are about behaviors. There are many anorexics who are not underweight but struggle with behaviors. And why do most of them never seek treatment? Because they argue that they are a healthy weight and they can do it on their own. My friend from college dropped out of school last year, and her parents admitted her into an outpatient program. Unfortunately, she was not progressing enough and she felt invalid in her ED, so she sought out a residential program. Five to six months later, she’s never been so happy in her life. She is always full of energy and is always body positive. Of course, she still struggles, but she learned many healthy coping mechanisms and seeking help for her ED also battled her depressive thoughts. 

The point I am making is that you may not think you need residential because you appear healthy and think you will be able to handle it. And maybe you can. But in most cases, individuals fall in and out of their ED, and it gradually gets worse over time as the behaviors increase. I still highly recommend residential, or at least looking for one. I’m not looking at the short term of this, I’m looking at long term recovery.",Nut-Loaf,1571326404.0,2019-10-17 10:33:24,"As for other tips. Most of the time, people with ED struggle to get into intense, physical activity without taking it to the extreme. Therapists recommend exercising being a gradual process. Starting with a short walk. Then trying to power walk, then jogging, then mile runs and so on. Some recommend yoga (this is an exercise promoted by The Emily Program). A famous documentary called I am Maris revolves around a woman who struggles with an ED and teaches yoga. She’s on Instagram known as @yogamaris. 

When you exercise or workout, make sure to eat something afterwards. Rather than losing weight, you will stabilize your weight and will build muscle as well. This means having protein rich food or drinks. Along with carbs. You don’t need to have a massive amount though (I have to because my metabolism is through the roof lol). As for coping, I would talk to your therapist about that. They would probably think of good thought strategies to help you avoid being caught in a negative view of yourself and relapsing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1088,dhiqrj,Pipergnome,1571015908.0,2019-10-13 20:18:28,"When I first started recovery, I gained weight like crazy (even above pre-ed weight). It was so quick. This isn’t very natural for bodies to do. It was just that I had restricted so much and for so long that my body would just hold onto anything. 

At first, I had trouble listening to my body and starting overeating. At times, I’d restrict like crazy again. It was the ups/downs of recovery. 

It’s been a few years since I’ve restricted. My average weight actually just stays the same. The amount I used to overeat and gain lots of weight from just doesn’t have that same effect anymore. Maybe I gain a pound or two. Then it goes away in a day or two when I eat normal again. The body doesn’t try to cling onto food the same way bc I’m not depriving like I had before. 


I still get binges, just not as often. I also confuse binges with eating a normal amount or just over eating.  Recovery has taken me years. And I’ve had relapses. I’m under my pre-Ed weight. My eating habits and lifestyles changes are much healthier than they were before though. 

It’s just now I battle with this awful feeling about being a higher weight than I’d prefer and having the freedom of food. I can go out with friends. I can go on vacation. I don’t have to plan every single thing and live in fear of gaining weight.

Don’t do try and push through. If you have the opportunity to go, go now, the sooner the better. The longer this disease has to fester, the harder it is to get rid of it. I truly believe doing the whole process of residential to PHP to IOP to outpatient has saved my life and saved me from relapse.

I think there’s this point in recovery where you realize you have to face weight gain. And there’s no running from it. 

The weight is not the issue. I believe Doctors &amp; dietitians are sometimes too focused on making your weight this perfect healthy weight. That’s not really realistic. 

Eating disorders are a mental issue that kills your body. So focus on the root of the problem. Your mental physical &amp; emotional HEALTH. I’ve come to the realization that “recovery” isn’t just eating &amp; gaining weight &amp; fixing the mental issues. Now you have to learn to love your body. Workout. Stretch. Eat healthy foods. Focus on what makes you feel GOOD AND WHOLE. Not weight gain or an increase in eating. It’s not easy but you will reap what you sow 💞

Learn healthy habits. Learn balance. Understand yourself. Be accepting &amp; loving of yourself. You are not defined by a number on the scale. By the calories you ate today. You deserve to feel energized &amp; content. You deserve to enjoy food &amp; life. And your body deserves nourishment.  💗

I’m also learning that the ED voice will be very present sometimes. But you I am stronger then to bow down to it. I am aware of my fear of weight gain and it saddens me but I will not fall victim to it. I know that life is more fulfilling when I am healthy over when I am listening to my ED voice",MaryContrary26,1570932635.0,2019-10-12 21:10:35,I felt heavy depression from gaining weight in recovery. But the depression didn't have that nightmarish quality that comes with starvation. Remember how it felt? It was like living in this other dimension where you're always afraid and you never feel grounded. It's like you're disconnected from yourself and everyone else. Well I chose the depression and just plowed through. And eventually it lifted and I was able to feel valued for non weight related reasons . I just want you to know that if you stick it out your brain will eventually shift back to normal.,Ellie_the_cat,1570936822.0,2019-10-12 22:20:22,"Thank you for posting this.

Unfortunately other things distracted me pulling me out of anorexia and focusing on other things. Being so meticulous about the number on the scale ruins us. You just have to be careful. Do things you enjoy. Honestly I still count calories to this day, which some may view as extremely unhealthy. I don’t count to restrict. I count to maintain. Because I’ve tortured my body so much and before I came from a place of over consuming, I can’t understand my natural hunger cues. I know it’s sounds extremely stupid but I’ve started to try to think of food as fuel rather than poison. And what got me over the number aspect was realizing I am thankful for my healthy body and ability to have food to eat. Like I said, I still count calories (it doesn’t work for everyone so if you have an unhealthy obsession with the numbers, ditch them). But for me if some days I go out to eat and I can’t track (one of my previous biggest fears) I know now the weight gain from that night is only temporary. I know being a recovered anorexic is hard. And we all still struggle with disordered thoughts. Take it honestly one step at a time. And realize you can do this.",Lilith-Rising,1570939978.0,2019-10-12 23:12:58,"I can’t give specific advice but I can share that I had a similar hard time to to the point where I was in a severe depression about it and even mobility became an issue, that didn’t match my idea of health, balance and recovery so I had to accept the fact that I did need to pay closer attention to what I ate and did and it was hard to do so without spiraling into obsessive restriction again, it’s all about finding a balance and coping mechanisms for stress , and having a good support system to turn to cope. It was nice ignoring my weight and intake for a while in recovery but at some point it was also disordered to dissociate from what I was doing on a daily basis. Use professionals as guides but be an advocate for yourself because they don’t always know what’s best for you, if somethings off you should bring up your concerns. It was definitely an uncomfortable journey for me and it’s not over yet. I’d recommend mindfulness and yoga or some sort to destress, all of this is so stressful and I’m sorry you’re being stressed by this, learn your limits and push yourself and be kind to yourself all at the same time.

It’s easy to see extra weight or bloating as being ugly or unhealthy but you can eat vitamin rich foods that metabolize well and you’ll feel way better and you’ll look better too. If your worried about gaining weight you can start by eating lower calorie fruits and vegetables that are cooked and seasoned correctly so they taste good. Focus on how the cells in your body take in and process for and look at it as energy instead of weight. Then you can just excercise and burn the unwanted calories you eat. No matter what you choose to do at first you’re going to feel weird and the food is not going to sit well because your body is used to purging. Sit with the uncomfortable feeling and wait it out. It will go away. Also before you binge / purge think about your teeth. You are rotting your teeth with stomach acid by doing this so frequently and they will not age well if you continue. One more thing- think about the down falls of other people. No one is perfect and people aren’t shit so there is no reason to try to impress them.

1104,dm9lsy,akatsuki_no_bun,1571883739.0,2019-10-23 21:22:19,"Vyvanse was a bad time for me. It made me not eat all day but then I was SUPER hungry at night. I don’t think I’ve ever felt as desperate to eat as O would about 10 hours after taking vyvanse, it was like my stomach was a pit that would not end. It scared me so much I stopped taking it after a month. Binge eating isn’t really something I do (more of a consistent over eating followed by periods of restriction person), but I did it on vyvanse pretty much every time I took it and my psychiatrist was baffled but it definitely messed with me and I gained like 25 pound in the 4 weeks I took it 😬 

Overall 0/10, would not try again but I’m pretty sure I had a paradoxical reaction. The nausea went away a bit after I got used to it (2 weeks?) but taking it with food can also help. Also coffee was a no go while on it, it made all of it much worse.",Toast_in_the_Toaster,1572018328.0,2019-10-25 10:45:28,"I'm on Vyvanse as well but I do not have problems with nausea, however I've been on other meds in the past that did. My recommendation is to talk to your doctor and consider trying something else. I know switching meds is stressful, but when it comes to finding the right meds, it's about figuring out if the pros outweigh the cons. It's no fun to be extremely nauseous and there may be another drug out there that helps you without the nausea. 

If you really don't want to change your medication then you can talk to your doctor about anti-nausea meds (can usually be found over the counter); always talk to your doctor first when adding new medication to avoid any interactions with your current medication.",superschuch,1572091500.0,2019-10-26 07:05:00,"Let your doctor know. Tell them how/when you take the medication, maybe something could be changed there. Are you taking it after eating or on an empty stomach? Do you drink a full glass of water with your pill? Maybe a few saltines or sips of ginger ale would help with the nausea? 

If it continues to be a problem and you don't feel you can stay on the med, ask about other options that are less likely to cause nausea. Topamax was really helpful to me with b/p urges. I was able to achieve months, then years of b/p free time staying on Topamax. I had one relapse when I moved into a dorm in college that lasted maybe 6 months. I had to get help from a dietician to get back on track.

1105,dm9los,O8274,1572912803.0,2019-11-04 18:13:23,"hi, your eating problems sound very familar. From the sounds of it (I am in no way qualified in any way) yeah you probably do have an eating disorder which is very strongly linked with anxiety (maybe academic anxiety in particular). To be an ED sufferer you don't have to fit into something binary qualification or specific diagnosis. It took me a while to get in contact with a gp because I thought it was just a quick about me,  not an actual illness. But if this is affecting you most days then it is (again I'm not a doctor, just an opinion) definitely an illness and some kind of ED. Other physical indicators that what you have is an illness include changes in weight, (in your case have you lost any weight), have you become increasingly tired and lethargic, have you become paler/ get dizzy when you stand up, have a bad immune system, (according to [This website ](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321612.php) . 

I'm not sure exactly what I have, but I restrict my eating habits due to feeling extremely nauseous from anxiety. You've definitely done the right thing by going to the doctor, some doctor's surgeries have a specific GP that's better equipped to help with ED and low BMIs so next time you book an appointment you might want to ask if they have a specialist for this. Also not all GPs do regular bmi checks,  so if your okay with measuring your weight yourself you might want to download it the NHS bmi app as it plots it on a graph for you and can be really useful for keeping a record of your weight. 

The other thing I suggest is trying to combat the anxiety itself.  When I feel like I don't want to eat because of anxiety induced nausea, there are a few tricks I've learnt to help;
Drink small sips of water often (not excessive, you want to avoid filling up on water). Try mindfulness and breathing exercises in particular; I know it can seem trivial but it not only calms your mind but also your body/digestive system. There are lots of free online resources about breathing exercises and mindfulness,  my favourite is an app called Youper which is main fully for recording mental health changes,  but they also do free meditative guides to breathing techniques which has a blue blob that grows/shrinks as be breathing in and out. they tend to teach you this in therapy but I know how long the waiting lists can be, hope you get yours quickly though. 

Another possibility is to ask your gp about medication. Anxiety causes sickness partly due to the fight or flight response (evolutionary speaking, if a caveman vomited they would lose body weight and therefore be able to run away faster from an attacking bear). I don't know how similar your experience is to mine, but this bodily reaction to fear was one of the main reasons I want eating. This fight or flight response can be calmed by beta blockers, I take a high dose and it really calms my physical state and so I've been able to eat relatively normal again. Beta blockers have little side effects and so doctors are usually happy to prescribe them.  

I'm wishing you the best, I know it's a struggle but you don't have to do it alone. Pm me if you ever need someone to talk to. Best of luck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1107,dm9k8r,ParkingTadpole,1571885372.0,2019-10-23 21:49:32,"Hi friend. You and I have shockingly similar stories (as do many, many other people) in that it started as weight loss and devolved into calorie counting, restricting, then finally an obsession with food that eventually turned to purging every time I ate something outside of what I allowed myself. This went on to the point that, on the rare occasion I DID go out for dinner on a social gathering, I purged before I even left the restaurant. This is not a path that you want to go down and I’m glad you’re seeking advice before reaching that point. 

I am not going to definitively say that you have an eating disorder based on one post on the internet. However, I think by even posting here on the first place, you are starting to feel uncomfortable and questioning your relationship with food, which is reason enough to seek professional help. I recommend that you seek help from a mental health professional who can help you unpack this very complex issue and give you coping mechanisms as well as the proper referrals to make sure you are physically healthy. 

As far as right here right now, I suggest taking these steps: 1) look up mental health professionals in your area and make some phone calls. 2) Start listening to your body instead of your brain...do you feel hungry? Good, eat something. Does that ice cream look extra good right now? Cool, have a bit as a snack, even if it’s later at night. Your body is hungry for a reason. Practice listening to it and giving it what it’s asking for. The best thing you can do for yourself is eat when you’re hungry and stop when you’re full. It takes practice to listen to your body’s cues, but with time it becomes second nature. 3) Tell someone you trust how you’ve been feeling. Since they know you so well, they will likely be able to offer more personalized advice and be a supporter when you’re feeling challenged. 

Best wishes!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1108,dm9jo9,sexting_satan,1572061262.0,2019-10-25 22:41:02,"so guys, an update:

I finished the partial program today and i'm feeling SO much more hopeful about everything. while being there, i've had an amazing therapist and he's truly has had such a positive impact on my life. i feel like now i finally have a destination i've yet to arrive to, and i also feel like i'm in the right direction. i feel like now, i have the strength and hope to get there. today i had a family meeting and we talked a lot about my eating habits and how my mom thinks i might slowly be getting back into that pattern. but i made a promise to the both of them that i'm going to eat regularly and i'm going to stop obsessing over the excess amount of skin on my body. i'm going to stop counting calories like crazy. something that really helped me (which i always thought was absolute bullshit) is he explained to me that basically with everything i'm dealing with (depression, anxiety, ptsd) i will never be able to recover if i'm not eating right. apparently it makes your anxiety 100x worse (which explains a lot) and obviously it all drains you so much and to be honest that's something i don't miss at all about my eating disorder. i'm already tired enough as is. i'm already insecure. and i know that letting myself get back into that pattern, no matter how much i want pounds to drop as quick as possible - it's not worth it. it's the disorder talking. it's the disorder telling me i need to see those pounds shred. but me? i'm capable of this. 

today i ate a slice of pizza, a poptart, somewhat of a bagel, and two cookies. i'm really fucking proud of myself. and if anybody is reading this right now please just know you have so much going for you. watching yourself starve is only going to make you obsess more and become unhappier. making yourself throw up becomes an addiction and you feel so guilty and embarrassed after each time. binging makes you feel so horrible afterwards but feels so good in the moment. but none of this is a cure to your problems. i know you feel like you don't want to get better. i'm not going to lie, i pinched my stomach after each meal today and ran to the bathroom and cried after i ate the pizza. it's so hard. but i've been on this journey for so long. on and off, on and off. and i'm hoping this is my last time. and i'm hoping this has helped someone in some sort of way. cause you are so worthy and so much more than what you see in the mirror. i promise. please just eat those chicken nuggets that smell so good but you're always so scared to eat, or challenge yourself to smaller meals without throwing up, or eat all the good stuff throughout the day. you're going to struggle at first, believe me. but eventually, you have to break this pattern. it's not healthy. it's not supposed to be you and the disorder against everyone trying to help you. it should be you against the disorder. and i promise you - you're going to fucking win.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can live the rest of your life never owning a scale or having one in your house and be perfectly happy and healthy. There may come a time where you want to own one again, but that time is not now. The answer to your question is in framing your goal properly in your mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now you have at least a couple years ahead of you of hard work, but there's good news... your weight and the shape of your body has absolutely nothing to do with your goals right now. Your main goal right now should be to fix your relationship with food and heal your body and mind. It is a long and difficult process and your body will change during this time period - but keep in mind, even normal people with no disordered history with food will fluctuate from week to week, month to month, year to year. I've been recovered for a while now, and I've realized I'm actually rather powerless to control my own fluctuations (without getting into specifics) and I'm much better off just accepting that they happen, and using my energy to focus on other, more important things in life like my relationships and hobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

To share very briefly from my own experience, coming from a restrictive eating disorder, I had to go through the recovery process, which was emotionally one of the hardest things I've ever done (emotionally). But one thing that a lot of bodybuilders talk about that I kept in my head as motivation to keep gaining weight was that ""losing weight is the easiest thing you can do"". Building muscle is hard. Getting faster and more athletic is hard. For me, eating when I'm hungry, is hard, and still is some days, with my history. But losing weight is pretty simple at the end of the day (calorie deficit), and if you've a background of restrictive eating disorders, the one thing you've consistently proven is that you know how to lose weight. For once in your life, consider challenging yourself to something new and more difficult - that's what this process is. Gaining weight is harder for you than losing weight, psychologically. But it's the one thing that's going to make everything else better for you in the long run.",shtooops_,1571686891.0,2019-10-21 14:41:31,just weigh yourself like once a month so you can be sure you are staying on track and ignore it the rest of the time,156nilknarf,1571687409.0,2019-10-21 14:50:09,"OMG I’ve been in an IOP for ED for 5 weeks now and not knowing my weight drives me crazy.

It can fuel the ED. Also dont force them to eat. Ever! It can make it worse. :( suggesting or asking ""have you had a bite today yet?:)"" tends to translate well than ""have you eaten? What is your calorie intake?""
Example would be when someone told me ""wow youre losing weight"" made me REALLY want to lose more to prove.
I think if anything, ask if they are comfortable with questions first. Be conscious and use common sense!!
When it comes to gender, its essentially the same thing. Usually control, dislike of appearance, etc. Im assuming excuses or what about their appearance might differ. **these come from knowing a guy w/ an ed. His hands are his biggest thinspo.
A lot is just personal. But i think its generally advisable? 

Lastly, youre a very admirable person for wanting to help your s/o. Not many people would go out of their way to understand. You have my utmost respect and gratitude. I wish my people did this:(

Edit- spelling",Nut-Loaf,1571620632.0,2019-10-20 20:17:12,"The behaviors men and women with an eating disorder express are relatively consistent, so I think there is no worry there. You should avoid downplaying his anxiety and simply give him something to eat or tell him to eat something. Your boyfriend is not choosing to have anxiety over food and it is more complex than simply asking him to eat something (e.g. telling a depressed person to stop being sad). You should also *be careful* about your compliments towards him if they are related to his physical appearance. In other words, avoid saying he looks thin or bigger (like bulkier). Even if they are well-intended, such compliments might feed into his negative thoughts. 

In order to be supportive, you need patience. Eating disorders are difficult to handle and you may need to endure the difficulties with him. When you encourage him or compliment him, say things that build his character and focus on his personality. After all, it is a mental disorder and encouragement can help improve his mindset. Also, please take of yourself. Be patient and be there for him when you can, but be sure to take care of yourself and show yourself some love. Encourage him to seek help with his eating disorder and maybe you can see a counselor to help you be informed and show your support.",bianspo,1571678882.0,2019-10-21 12:28:02,"Say if you really feel like it needs to be said. I'm going through a similar situation...
So my boyfriend suffers from bulimia. When we started dating he would justify his binges by saying he didn't have a single meal for one or two days, then, he would wait for 10-20 minutes to go purge to his bathroom. And to justify his purges he would address that the food he ate was in a bad state.
To show him I'm not a fool and I empathize with him I gave this boy a ""bulimic-to-bulimic tip when B/P"".
He was thinking what he was going to ""eat"" that day, and before he ordered anything I said to him: ""The margarita pizza from [restaurant name], with sugar free soda and no spices is specially easy to throw up. Promise it goes out like whipped cream"".
May have sound very rude at that moment, he must have felt like someone discovered a crime he committed... But I understand how an ED is and feels like.
It's obvious that no one but a professional can help us to recover but any little help from normal people can make a tiny difference
ED act the same way no matter the gender. The only thing and the worst you could say to someone with an ED is to eat normally, because at some point we forgot how to.
And if he is willing to talk about the problems he has just listen, understand that for him, food is more than just that. I wouldn't recommend to try to give any advice, but that's a personal opinion... Some people (including myself) doesn't take them the correct way.

You can definitely have an eating disorder (even a restrictive one) at any weight. And it’s more about what’s going on in your head than anything.

1122,dk1qn2,catherose,1572008676.0,2019-10-25 08:04:36,"Hi there,

I'm sorta in the same position as yourself, I was diagnosed with anorexia last year, and whilst I recovered the summer of this year, I'm starting to fall back and I too am unsure of whether to call it a relapse.

However, anorexia isn't just about the weight, it's about the mental aspect of it.  And if that is present like you mentioned then it is a big warning sign that you could be falling back to your ED.  I am in no means a professional so seeking help is the best route (even though it is very scary).  But just posting on here shows that a little bit of you knows it is wrong, even if it's just a little bit.

One of the hardest parts of an ED is that if you don't eat, your mind is malnourished and therefore can't think logically and so it fuels and perpetuates the ED.  If you can tell your fiancé that would be amazing and whilst so hard, it would be such a powerful step in the right direction.  He can almost act like the 'logical' brain whilst you malnourish yours, and encourage you and support you through this difficult time.

Also try increasing your intake slowly, or use any techniques that help you.  What helps me is eating with others who have a healthy relationship with food and then using the conversation to distract myself from the eating.  However different things work for different people.

Wishing you all the best and hope that things start improving for you 💗",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s not fair to have so many negative thoughts when you should be focusing your thoughts on being happy for the baby.  I have a child of my own and I am pregnant right now so I relate to a lot of what you’re saying. 

Unfortunately disordered thoughts never go away even when they “should” and changing how you think about your food and body will take a big conscious effort, it’s an endeavor that’s probably too big to start right now (true acceptance in your thoughts) while I’m sure you have many stressful thoughts about becoming a parent.  Be kind to yourself and don’t think poorly of yourself if you keep having disordered thoughts about food right now.

As far as being on strict guidelines about food, I was also told this during my first pregnancy—yes, eat when you are hungry, but try to fill up on fruits and veggies and protein before giving in to a craving for sweets and salty snacks.  Keep yogurt, cut fruit, cut vegetables, crackers, and nuts on hand to eat when you’re hungry between meals.  If after a meal you’re still hungry, feel free to eat a reasonable amount of “junk”—like 2 scoops of ice cream in a bowl instead of an entire pint, a handful of chips in a bowl instead of a whole bag.  Your child will not be harmed by some sugar and salt if it’s a treat that makes up a small part of your diet.  

It’s really hard to try to recover without eating all of what you want to eat (like junk foods) but it’s worth the effort to keep eating healthy since your baby will benefit.  If there are some days where you can’t eat right, that’s fine too.  Your baby will pull all of the nutrition it needs from your body during short periods of time when you’re not able to eat as healthy as you’d like.  

I wish you the best of luck in getting through this time in your life, and congratulations on the child that you will be meeting soon!",cyntalaDuPriest,1571602967.0,2019-10-20 15:22:47,Most processed foods will not harm ur baby.

1125,djl20x,chicken-pirate,1571393063.0,2019-10-18 05:04:23,"From my personal experience in the UK, I got referred to a clinic where they asked multiple questions about my everyday life, how I feel on a daily basis etc then they referred me to someone to talk to about my daily life and what potentially could trigger my ed and linked it to emotions and my daily routine.

For me personally I expected a lot more from it as she didn’t really help me, she just wrote down everything I’d said and linked it all together.

The waiting list and being referred from one place to another to determine who I needed to talk to, was quite lengthy, maybe three or four months, at that point in my life I was in a good place so by the time I saw her I just said I’ll be fine and never went back.

I don’t want this to discourage you in anyway, and I hope you get the best help possible, but I’m just trying to let you know the process of what I went through, no blood tests or anything like that but again, this was on the NHS in the uk so your experience might be different.",Toast_in_the_Toaster,1571412910.0,2019-10-18 10:35:10,"If right now you are going to appointments (not a treatment program like IOP or PHP)  then here's what you can likely expect from my experience:

1. Most likely they will take blood (just a couple vials) to see what's going on there. This may happen every 6 months or so. If anything is low they may put you on certain supplements. But depending on the severity and length of the eating disorder, any damage there can easily be repaired so I wouldn't worry too much about it. They'll give you a physical, check your weight(probably blind weights if they're aware of the eating disorde, but it depends on the doctor/nurse), blood pressure, and heart rate. 

2. They may recommend telling people in your life because having a support system outside of doctors can be extremely helpful but they also understand how hard it can be to do that and it's up to you if you want to tell others. Not telling family and friends isn't really an indicator that you aren't serious about your recovery. They're just trying to find the best way to help you and it's up to you to decide what's helpful and what's not. It's best for you to tell people when/if you feel comfortable doing so. Telling my close friends helped keep me accountable, but it doesn't make or break your recovery. Going to seek help at all shows that you want this for yourself and you aren't doing it because others are telling you to. You're serious about it. 

3. This really depends. At the outpatient level you are scheduling weekly/biweekly appointments with a psych and therapist and those can be pretty easy to schedule around work. They could recommend a higher level of care like IOP(3 days a week usually), PHP (five days a week) or inpatient(going to a treatment center full time) depending on the severity. But the doctors understand that you have other things going on too and just talk to them about your concerns with this. They will only recommend what they think will be best for you and you need to trust them. Recovery is important and work comes second. You're in the early stages and as you move forward you'll have to cross those bridges when/if you come to them. Don't worry too much now, your doctor's won't spring something on you. Just talk to them about everything. And if you aren't feeling comfortable with your doctor, remember that it's okay to find someone else. It's important that you establish a trusting relationship with your treatment team. 

I know that this can be really scary and it's all new and it's okay to be nervous about it. Be open and honest, even when you slip up, it'll help you in the long run. Don't say what you think they want to hear. They're here to help and will work with you. At the end of the day this is for you, just make the most out of it.

You have your blood drawn to do tests on all your blood counts and if you’re low on like calcium, potassium, etc. and usually you get a TB test to make sure you’re safe to be around others.

It will most likely cut into your work schedule depending on which program you go to. IOP is the least invasive to your schedule, but sometimes IOP schedules are during the morning/afternoon. BUT, this will be best in the long run. Getting help as early as possible will give you more freedom later in life.

My disorder has been bad for about a year (I've had disordered eating for years but it's been definition bulimia for a little under a year now). So I think I can relate my experience to you pretty well. 
1. Electrolyte labs (via blood) and weight check. Of you arent underweight or close to underweight it probably won't be too often. Throat/neck examination. Looking for swollen lymph nodes and damage done by stomach acid. 
2. It's never even been mentioned to me I need to tell a soul. I told my therapist I can't do x time because that's when me and my bf see each other and he doesn't know about this. She just said okay. She never made it sound like I need to tell others for me to be serious about getting better. 
3. Depends on how extensive your treatment is. My only regular appt is a therapist once a week. The answer to this depends on your physical severity and level of treatment (inpatient, out patient, all day treatments). So far it hasn't been an interruption to my life. I look forward to learning more to get closer to recovery.

Also if they have experience with EDs they’d know that an eating disordered brain isn’t going to believe you’ve been losing weight without trying.

You got this and remember that loving yourself comes first, everyone’s recovery is different and it’s okay to question things during this time &lt;3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1129,dp137z,gnosiscna,1572409960.0,2019-10-29 23:32:40,"Personally for me, I had to stay on a strict meal plan for about a year after treatment, or else I would easily fall back into my eating disorder. Specific meal times and specific meals to choose from helped me tremendously. I think the problem with eating disorders and not following meal times/plans, is that our bodies get way more confused than the average one. To this day, if I miss one meal (and not even compensating with snacks), my hunger cues will be messed up for at least a week until I get back to normal eating times. I would also think in depth about why you think it’s okay you didn’t reach your “goal weight” in treatment. Is it because you’re scared of looking a certain way? Or is it because you genuinely feel like you’re “healthy” now? Also you have to take in account what age you were and how y’all you were  before your eating disorder started, and what you are now. That always is taken into account when your treatment team is coming up with a suggested goal weight range.",Toast_in_the_Toaster,1572532785.0,2019-10-31 09:39:45,"Hi, I'm the OP. I really appreciate your response and you bring up some good points. I try to keep up with my meal plan, however I was discharged from treatment on their highest meal plan which usually they try not to discharge people on that meal plan because it is extremely difficult to do on your own and that's the problem I've run into. I legitimately can't afford to keep up with such a rigorous meal plan but I try to make sure I have every component of my meals to the best of my ability but I find it hard to keep up with the consistency with an inconsistent schedule. I know I could do better though and I'm trying to. 

As far as the goal weight goes, my eating disorder developed as an adult. They didn't really specifically tailor my goal weight to me, they took the average weight for my height and age even though I've never been ""average"" and my family is pretty small as well. Also, I think they based it off my ""highest weight"" which I was at when I was obsessively working out and had a lot of muscle mass. I know that my body wouldn't naturally stabilize at that weight without gaining muscle weight. They refused to reevaluate my goal weight unless I could provide growth charts, which I couldn't provide. So while I never reached that goal weight, I also never felt like their goal weight was reasonable, not because I was scared of looking a certain way... If anything I wish I could reach that weight through just eating enough. I feel my weight now is a healthy weight for me personally but I'm not opposed to gaining more. 

But because I felt like my treatment team didn't listen to me about my weight, it's led to a lot of problems when it comes to my confidence surrounding my recovery. I feel like I was discouraged to trust myself and if I don't fullfil what my treatment team wants then I'm doing it wrong. They often accused me of lying because I was losing weight while in inpatient (still gaining overall, but super slowly). It was like recovery was judged off of how much weight I gained and that was the main thing that mattered... So even though I feel like their goal weight for me was unreasonable, I still feel like I'm failing...or that I should be doubting myself as long as I'm not xxx weight. And it honestly messes with me pretty bad. I don't know how to be content with my weight even if I'm eating well because it's not what they said. And if I try to talk to a professional about it, they brush off my comments as ""well she has an eating disorder so we can't trust what she has to say about her weight"". It just hurts... It's like if you have an eating disorder... You can't have opinions about your weight in recovery and are discouraged to trust yourself. And I get it, but I know I'm not just arguing a lower goal weight because I want to be thin. Sorry for the long reply... I'm just really messed up about this.",gnosiscna,1572536206.0,2019-10-31 10:36:46,"I think it would be helpful to create a new team (out patient) and talk about this with them, if it’s financially possible. I do understand why they wouldn’t “trust” you in treatment. They do get a bunch of people trying to lie to get out quicker. But at the same time it sounds like you didn’t get a decent team that will listen to you own concerns either. I’ve been to 3 different places for treatment and only 2 of them really listened to my concerns. My OP team is great too. It sounds like to me that you’re in a decent state of mind where you fully realize what you personally need to stay on track, especially after 1.5 years of recovery. (I’m not a therapist or anything so I can’t technically clinically say if you’re doing great or not). 

I get that being on a high meal plan while not in treatment is incredibly expensive (been there, sadly). Technically what they try to keep up is the caloric value of things, so have you tried like boosts or ensures? I know nuts have good nutrition too. Are you with a dietitian right now? Non-diet and eating disorder dietitians are the best to be with in this situation. I hope i’m not sounding super controlling or invalidating you’re feelings at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eating disorders are emotional coping mechanisms. I didn't develop an eating disorder because I didn't like food. I developed one because I was insecure with myself and the eating disorder felt like a way for me to gain some sort of control over my life that felt like it was spiraling. 

You really need to take a step back and analyze why you aren't making the effort to eat proper meals. I understand GI issues can be extremely debilitating and can severely impact appetite. GI issues can cause people to develop eating disorders. But, eating disorder or not, what you're doing is unhealthy and some of the things you say in your post are concerning. Such as ""I feel better with an empty stomach"" and the fact that you are being so secretive.

You know that how you are eating right now isn't okay, that's why you're anxious about it. Your eating patterns are disordered and you need to determine why they are. Don't worry so much about whether it's an ED or not. That's irrelevant. What matters is that you're clearly concerned about it. Talk to your doctor and consider a therapist as well to help you distill your thoughts and motivations. That is where you need to begin to undo this. 

Just so it's extremely clear to you: *this is a problem*. You cannot continue to justify these unhealthy habits.

1. ""I feel guilty for not working out today"" - Your goal right now is not to reach peak fitness. You will not be able to reach peak fitness in a starvation state anyway.
2. ""I feel like this is too much food"" - Your goal is to fix your hunger signaling and this is literally only made possible by consistent ""overeating"" and putting on weight. Any restriction continues/extends the cycle.
3. ""I feel guilty for eating XYZ junk food"" - Don't eat it if it's going to cause you more distress. You can gain weight eating literally any food right now because your body is starving. Eat healthy whole foods. Eat a ton of them. Your goal is to gain weight and feel better. That is absolutely going to happen if you make it your goal. Eat some fun foods, too, and don't feel guilty, because fun foods will help you gain weight even more effectively than whole foods.

There's part of me that fears gaining weight and then there's the other side of me that's done it a million times by now and knows that I respond to weight gain just like everyone else in this world and I'll feel better and perform better when I gain weight. The gym will be more fun because I'll have more energy. ""Weight moves weight"". Even on the bike, I set all of my PR's this season on Strava at my absolute peak weight.

In terms of parents:
- Don't expect them to understand or even care. I know they should be loving and supportive but let's be honest, some can't handle this responsibility and are no different from your classmates. That's hard to accept/ takes time to realize but doing so will keep you from crying a lot in the future. Same goes for older siblings. 

In terms of your body:
- You put a lot of thoughts into the impression you have on others, don't you? Your body doesn't matter. I don't think a person worth opening up and talking to will hate/ignore you because you have big thighs... 
- Of course you'll look a little stylisher a few pounds of but you don't need to be there tomorrow. That's not possible and nobody expects you to do the impossible 

Just focus on getting one friend to open up to (Don't be afraid of the odd personalities they're the best :)/ I met one of my besties at comic con) and please don't starve yourself. Keep yourself busy (drawing, learning,...) and eat two to three meals a day (or however much you want).

I’m sorry this is happening... I was seeing a nutritionist who, after a few months, told me she thought I had disordered eating. I was on the low borderline of normal weight but she insisted it didn’t matter, because my eating habits reflected disordered eating (in my case, depression, anxiety, trauma, grief, I could go on, but I wasn’t even doing it on purpose). 

My point is that she wanted to speak with my doctor, psych, therapist etc.  Perhaps you could consult a nutritionist and discuss the issues and I’m sure they’ll be able to write a note to your doctor explaining what help you need.

It doesn’t have to be a long term consultation with the nutritionist, maybe 2-3 would be enough for them to get to know you and your concerns.

No matter what weight you start at, quick and significant weight loss is a disturbance to your physiology, especially if you have concerns about it, you should be able to get the help you need. I think the nutritionist is a good starting point. Hope it works, and let us know how you’re doing.",SlapstickVampire,1572200054.0,2019-10-27 13:14:14,"This is excellent advice.

But, since you're not underweight, getting help can be tough. Someone else here recommended seeing a dietician, psychologists can help too.

To start, I would recommend you at least start eating salads again, and you'll still notice some weight loss.

4 oz Chicken breast, or fish (salmon is good too)

1 hard boiled egg 

1 oz shredded cheese, (low fat is fine  - i like jarlsberg)

1 tbsp Hemp oil (maybe with lemon juice and spices in a salad dressing) - hemp oil is delicious and high in omega 3 fatty acids which are stupid good for you. (Or avocado, or hemp seeds)

Any assortment of vegetables you like, but spinach is really good, i also recommend peas and beans you will need to cook list if you cook them first. (1/4 c each)


That meal is about 600 calories. If you eat it 3 times a day you might keep losing weight (at 1800 calories, but your body will have some nutrients.)

If you eat that 3 times a day, you'll still need to supplement vitamin D, iron, and Vitamin E. But the rest of your nutrients should be ok. If you do 3 oz cottage cheese instead of low fat Jarlsberg, you'll need to supplement calcium too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just a word of advice.  I would scrub your social media accounts if I were you, because employers and parents do look at those now.  You have written a lot about your issues with your ED and your mother on the internet in accounts that you have identifying info about yourself and even pictures of yourself, and I don't think that is a good idea.  If I were you, I would make a throwaway account to use when you discuss your ED and your mother issues.  And go through your post history and delete any posts about these personal topics that are associated with your accounts in which you have posted pictures of yourself.  There is no reason to have so much personal info about yourself linked to your photo on the internet.

Right now the jobs are plentiful but if we go into a recession, which is getting more and more likely, that won't be true.  So I would try to get one now so that if we do go into a recession you have a chance of keeping your job if you have done a good job.  You seem very organized and pay attention to detail so you would likely be a good worker that they would want to keep if they have the ability to keep you during a recession.

Try to eat mostly at the same times each day, it'll make it easier for your body to understand when you're supposed to be eating. And don't be to hard on yourself, start out easy. You can't expect to go from eating next to nothing to eating like a regular person overnight. Choose things that are easy to eat for you and that you enjoy eating! Maybe choose some yoghurt and fruit over pancakes for breakfast, a salad instead of a sandwich for lunch etc. Know that in the beginning the most important part is getting used to eating again, both physically and mentally. You can start to eat more and different things once you're getting hunger cues at the right time. You'll just need to settle into a routine first.

When recovering from an eating disorder, it is challenging to get to that phase because the purpose of an ED is to fear food and full meals. 

What my therapist taught me was to eat mechanically as a method of relearning how to eat. Eating mechanically is eating 3 **FULL** meals, 2-3 snacks that consist of two items (apple &amp; yogurt for example), and a dessert/treat if I want, all in a day. When eating your food throughout the day you should never go longer than 4 hours without eating. 

When she told me this I just about died. That was way too much food for what I wanted to consume. She reframed food as medicine for me, if you want to get better, you need to take medicine. 

To help make sure I didn't cheat or compromise my progress she recommended this phone app [Recovery Record](https://www.recoveryrecord.com/).

Considering your state at the moment, you might have gastritis or something in your esophogus! Just to be safe if you ever feel sick, happened to me from purging.
Anyway, i would say your stomach is SO small so before you start that dealio, make sure you start slow!
•Breakfast can be the biggest meal but some people cant. Carbohydrates give energy (Protein too) so that meal tends to be packed with those:) eg. Eggs, cereal, toast, fruit like pears or bananas.  Starting with vitamins is nice to convert throughout the day. Coffee or tea too. MOST IMPORTANTLY- WATER!! 
°Usually not a snack but some people do depending on their physical activity.
•Lunch is usually something small but not the smallest. Usually a sandwhich to make more energy and stay full or a salad with fruits, like berries, and nuts. 
°A snack would be good now! Something like crackers, nuts, some people take a fruit or granola bars. 
•Dinner should be the smallest meal. Its late and the amount of excercise is typically low. Its unwinding time. This would be time for something like chicken, fish, or a nicely proportioned red-meat. A salad or mashed potatoes. 
°Light snack. Again maybe cucumbers, fruits, sometimes a treat like chocolate or chips. Depends on person. I was told that it is recommended to take a snack like 2 hours before due to sleeping on acid.

Also, my family believes it's better to eat when you are hungry with your family. Meals are NEVER skipped, if you are not hungry, you adjust your portion size accordingly.

We eat 4 times a day, which is based on our culture (we are in Europe and every culture is different). Breakfast at 8 am, lunch at 12 pm, afternoon snack at 4 pm and dinner at 8 pm. 

Breakfast is always porridge/cereal, a piece of fruit and coffee/tea/milk/.

Lunch is our cooked meal, a combination of cooked veggies, cooked carb, meat and some kind of fat. We drink water with it.

Afternoon snack is coffee/tea with something sweet, cookies, chocolate, cake, pancakes,fruit yogurt, toast with some sweet spread, even sometimes juice or soda...

Dinner is a savoury sandwich, raw veggies,a bag of salty snacks (popcorn, crisps...) and a dairy drink (milk or yogurt) because my family believes it helps you sleep.

I think of my ED in kind of two phases. Phase 1) simple anorexia/not eating when I was 11, and Phase 2) restricting and bingeing starting at 17.

Phase 1) had a lot of trauma associated with how my family reacted to it and how it affected our home life at that time. I would cry a lot which wasn’t nice for my parents and siblings. My parents also began to hit me and lose their temper with me. Eventually I was hospitalised which was good in the sense that I was away from home and bad in the sense that I was mostly alone in hospital even though my parents visited every day. I carry a lot of guilt and trauma for what I did to my family and how they were towards me in response. 

Phase 2) I went on the pill at 17 and a girl that was large told me she used to be my size before she went on the pill too. I was super worried about losing what I thought was the only valuable thing about myself, which was my natural thinness. The hormones made me depressed and foggy and gave me constant cramps which were easily confused with appetite. I was trying to restrict and would chew gum relentlessly to stop myself eating. Then I would binge and eat so much i felt like i was going to literally die. From that period I carry a lot of trauma for what i did to my body and how scary it was to make myself feel so unwell and literally like i was going to die. I also carry a lot of shame for this. 

Moving past all the trauma is definitely a long process, especially because remnants of my eating disorders still linger and working out my relationship with food, eating, my body, and all that shame is kind of an ongoing process.",Khaydii,1572996491.0,2019-11-05 17:28:11,"yes, im glad youre recovering and its been a full year! be proud of yourself. i myself awhile back developed anxiety and i wouldnt eat, then i wouldnt eat for so long id feel nauseas and would faint and i would puke up my stomach bile and just be dead for the rest of the day, and this went on for almost a year, now whenever i dont eat something for awhile i get a lot of anxiety that im gonna feel like crap so then i get stomach pain from the anxiety and try to snack of crackers or something, and this has been going on for a year aswell as im still in recovery from whatever that is. so yes ptsd from ed is real",JellyfishinaSkirt,1573017397.0,2019-11-05 23:16:37,"Actually I was wondering this myself because since recovering (mostly) from my ed in high school I’ve had a much harder time eating the same foods I used to eat when I was anorexic and forcing myself to do things like homework, exercise, go to new places.  it all reminds me of when I would force myself to be miserable for the sake of losing weight and I am terrified of going back to that dark place",annielovesbacon,1573020695.0,2019-11-06 00:11:35,I’m not sure if I’d classify it as PTSD for me (I’ve never really thought about it in this way) but I do feel a certain amount of trauma when I look back on my life.

And I know it sounds like a cop out for her, or an excuse, but I’m sure your mother loves you, but her disorder prevents her from being the best mother she can be.

You can listen, and be understanding, and try and help her, but at the end of the day, it is up to her to help herself get better. Just make sure you take time out for yourself, and your mental health as well.

I don’t think you have an ED because you are being notified by your body whether to eat or not eat. People with eating disorders (including anorexia, bulimia, binge eating, EDNOS, etc.) think about food firstly in terms of how unhappy they are and how much they hate their body. They stress about food all day. Actually eating food is stressful and afterwards there is a feeling is self hate.

If you have trouble with your appetite, try to eat simple foods throughout the day, not necessarily because you’re hungry but because you know you’ll need a little food or else you’ll get sick.

I think I did/do have an ulcer, and have been nauseous a lot of the time and just uninterested in eating. I wouldn’t suggest you go all day without eating because if you do have an ulcer, it will just get worse. 

At least during the day, try some crackers and dried fruit (I personally like dates, no nitrites but any kind of dried fruit will do). If you have something (even that little) in your stomach it may reduce the nausea or lack of appetite you have. Even if you’re not hungry you could probably cram in a few crackers and a handful of dates. Start with that and see if it helps. 

As for whether or not you have an eating disorder, it depends on how eager you are to fix your lack of appetite issue. If you’re « fine » with it but know it’s not normal, maybe something is up. If you genuinely wish you could eat more, and want to try, then it’s possible that you’re OK but not mecessarily.

Even if you had the most erratic eating patterns in the world but no guilt or shame about it, I think you probably wouldn’t benefit much from eating disorder therapy (maybe some nutritional counseling would be in order). 

But regardless of what diagnostic criteria you meet, you don’t have to be sick to a certain level or fit yourself into some dsmv psych label to deserve and warrant seeking real help. I agree wholeheartedly with the advice here to find someone you trust to talk to, best of all seek out someone trained to work with eating disorders. 

What you describe is misery, I know because as a recovered anorexic/bulimic I totally saw myself in your very eloquent though heart wrenching account. 

I want to point out that you are already quite skillful in identifying and articulating your feelings, which is a huge advantage when starting treatment. You’d be surprised at how stunted those of us who suffered a long time or during our formative years can be. 
Being able to say “I feel x about y” is itself a major asset in recovery. Reaching out for help even on reddit is another very promising sign, because the one thing is it’s nearly impossible to recover all alone, which you don’t ever have to be 🧡",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While mental illness explains a person’s behavior, it doesn’t excuse them treating you badly and damaging your own mental health. Also, from another perspective, you’re enabling her behavior by giving her an outlet to share these things. That’s no one’s fault, it’s just the situation. Let her know unequivocally that you will not tolerate thinspo photos or her own negative self talk (having a hard day is different than saying things like, I’m not going to eat today, I’m going to lose 20 pounds etc.).

None of them helped and she ended up hospitalised and missed 3 months of school in GCSE year due to going inpatient. Imagine what an earlier intervention could have done.
The only advice I have is to go private if possible. My friend got free therapy from her dad’s work insurance, maybe see if that’s an option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But it sounds like you may have body dismorphia. It goes hand in hand with eating disorders and your mind can play tricks on you and make you feel like you are larger than you are. Let me tell you though; don’t let your mind do that to you! I know it’s tough, but please take care of your body. Start having meals you really love and treat yourself to them. 

I struggle with an eating disorder too, only just recently seeing help for it and learning why I have such terrible body issues. It helps a lot to understand why you feel certain ways about yourself and to treat it. If you can afford to start seeing a professional, I would recommend it. Also there are groups online and anonymous centers you can go to to help you through this sort of thing. 

Or, alternatively, if you’d like to message me to just talk to someone who is going through something similar, I can at the least lend an ear. I’d hate to give you terrible advice since I’m still new to dealing with my own ED, but I know how hard it is to go through it alone.

In the meantime, please be kind to yourself! Don’t look in the mirror if you have to, have someone hide your scales, and eat foods you enjoy to help pace yourself through it!

Your partners can be supportive of you though. I know you don’t want your husband to be hounded so I’ll try my best, but frankly he’s wrong and “counting calories” isn’t the right answer, and can be a very dangerous mindset whether or not you have an ED.

A counselor would be my advice, as they could refer you to a nutritionist or dietician for additional help. I see you say your insurance doesn’t cover that, but you could try going to Planned Parenthood? They offer counseling services, and you can even chat with a health expert online or on the phone for free who could suggest the best route to take.

Also if you have PCOS, do you go to a gyno or endocrinologist? If so have you tried sharing your anxieties about your body with them because of your diagnosis, and may offer you a better care routine other than calorie counting",Redhawkgirl,1574291301.0,2019-11-20 17:08:21,Your husband needs education from a therapist or even a good book and you need therapy and nutrition.

Your body probably needed the food so I would try to focus on the fact that you did a good thing by listening to your body and yeah, you might have had more to eat than normal but you likely needed the energy. 

Try to focus on not being so strict with yourself about what you're eating; it's okay to have pizza. Eat regular, nutritious meals and have a snack when you are hungry, and pizza every now and then is not going to kill you. Try your best not to count calories. Your stomach will tell you what it wants and your head will say things like 'that's not a good option'. But you need to listen to your stomach just as much as your head. I'm not telling you to pig out on fries everyday (unless you really need to gain weight, in which case go for it) but please don't be so hard on yourself.

1228,dx5zpd,bahccus,1573909753.0,2019-11-16 07:09:13,"I felt this. I’ve struggled with an ED since I was about 14/15 though I’ve never gotten an official diagnosis  — though there was a time where I was certainly bad enough to have warranted one. Nowadays, I lean more towards defining my habits as “disordered eating” rather than an eating disorder. I weigh myself, though not regularly and not with the intention of losing weight, but to ensure that I‘m in the general neighborhood of my normal weight. I eat intuitively, though I still compensate days that I overeat with a “low cal” (I don’t really count calories) day afterwards. I’ve never suffered from BD or had any serious body image issues even at my lowest. I never thought that I was ugly or gross or bigger than I actually was, mostly because I think my ED was about personal “ideal” aesthetics combined with the importance of weight in my main sport at the time. Of course, I was still insecure about my weight loss like most people with EDs are. Like you, I do occasionally engage in disordered behaviors such as lax abuse, though maybe three or four times a year at most, and have attitudes around food that I know aren’t normal but don’t necessarily prevent me from eating “normally” when I have or want to. 

I don’t think I’ll have much problem going on like this indefinitely, but I think that minus your B/P and my lax abuse, this might just be what recovery looks like for some people. And maybe we’re ok! We still have holdover habits that need to be overcome, but I think that expecting “recovery” to mean when you’re “totally normal” is an expectation that isn’t realistic for most people. If you’re able to consistently overpower the part of you that compulsively turns disordered thoughts into disordered behaviors and you feel confident and empowered in your ability to do so, then that’s what I feel it means to be recovered.",seatangle,1573967706.0,2019-11-16 23:15:06,"I can relate to this in quite a few ways - also recovering from severe AN/BP. 

I think the main thing I’m getting is that things are much, much better now than they were before, but you still feel stuck in some aspects. 

I think my situation is kind of similar - I have a comfort zone that I don’t want to stray from because it mostly works but I know it’s not quite normal. For me, I’m pretty scared of doing stuff differently (changing my eating routines, eating more or different types of food) but I can deviate from my routine for one-off special occasions.

I haven’t actually thought too much about it, but I think I’m afraid of too much variety or change in eating patterns because of the risk of b/p. I haven’t done it in one year, which is by far the longest I’ve gone in over ten years (used to do it every day, sometimes multiple times per day). 

It makes me think, I never ever thought I would get to this point. I was pretty sure I’d just be binging and purging until it killed me. But I did get this far, and it took time. So maybe that’s something to keep in mind - this is one stage in recovery for you, and when you can you will push forward and get to a better place when it is possible. Feeling stuck could be a sign it’s time to be more flexible. If you made it this far, there’s no reason why you can’t get to a better place.",ThrowRA32838,1574010325.0,2019-11-17 11:05:25,"Hi, I was the one who made this post. Thank you for this, I really related to what you said on many levels. I too live in my comfort zone, which is nowhere near as debilitating as it once was when I was in the throes of my ED, yet I also know it's not exactly ""normal"". 

Just like you, I never ever thought that I would get to this point. I remembered one day in therapy where I was thinking, ""this whole therapy thing is pointless because I will never change"". But I did. I think what made me realise I was ""recovered"" was that I used to *always* want to ""go back"". In my recovery attempts in the past, I always had the lingering thought of ""going back"" eventually. But now, even though I feel stuck, I genuinely feel that I **never** want to go back. This feeling of, ""I don't want to go back there anymore"" was when I realised I had reached a whole new stage in recovery I never thought was possible. 

I loved what you said about, ""feeling stuck could be a sign it's time to be more flexible"". It's so true!! For so long, I was just so happy I made it out of the dark, so I stopped trying to be 'better'.

Thank you for this, I really enjoyed reading it as I related to what you said on so many levels. I too identify now with having disordered eating habits rather than having an 'eating disorder'.

Which to an outsider, may look bad, but we know that it was truly a difficult and wonderful thing that we were able to get out of that dark headspace of ED in the first place.

I also want to say, you don’t have to settle for less than 100% freedom from Ed. Those last bits you are holding on to, I would say those last bits offer the greatest reward in letting go, and there’s no reason for you to stop where you are. You deserve a life free from Ed 100% and in my opinion it is a battle worth fighting and never ever giving up on. 
Are you in therapy? If you can find a therapist who specializes in eating disorders whom you can really trust and build rapport with, they can guide you towards better understanding why you continue to hold on to bits of the old behaviors. Also because you have already greatly reduced your behaviors that makes therapy much more effective, so you have a major head start already

I had two motivators when deciding to undergo treatment for my anorexia: it was ruining my marriage and I was unable to weight lift because I was so weak (I've always loved it and have always been an athlete). While I completely understand why most people recommend those with EDs do not exercise during treatment, the only way I was going to go through with treatment was if I was still allowed to lift; because I don't do it for weight loss (unlike the excessive cardio). I do it because I love it. I struck a deal with my nutritionist that I would follow her meal plan if I was still allowed to weight lift. She said if I commit to eating a couple hundred more calories on those weightlifting days, fine. 

It really did save me. As my strength increased, as my energy levels increased, it transformed my relationship with food. If I eat a big meal, I don't feel guilt; I feel excitement because I think of the potential PRs I'll be able to hit.

Many in the running community are weight obsessed, and rules of thumb like the one you mentioned in your post request are pervasive (I edited it out because it may be the single biggest trigger for those who run. Those who participate in running boards all know it). That rule of thumb is *wrong*. It is only applicable to those who are *at least* that many pounds over a healthy and competitive running weight.  

My own experience with AN started when I read and heard similar advice about getting thinner to get faster. I stopped running completely for 3 years, after I wound up in the hospital. It was only after I was recovered for a few years that I started up again. My certain moment of recovery came after a race where I finished second overall. I had done a lot of weightlifting and developed a somewhat muscular upper body (I'm male) and the guy who finished ahead of me told me I was fast, but I could be faster if I cut some of my upper body muscle. I just told him, thanks, but I'm most comfortable at this wieght, and I moved on. Since then, I've run the Boston Marathon 14 times as a qualified runner. 

The fastest runners are healthy runners. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. When I entered the hospital years ago, I was at the point where I struggled to walk up stairs. Now I run up mountains, and I weigh far more.

I recommend you cut back or even stop running until you can ignore all of the weight talk in running and focus on being healthy. It's far too dangerous. You have time to achieve your goal. The race has been going on for about 120 years. It'll still be there when you're ready.",runhappy18,1573926157.0,2019-11-16 11:42:37,Wow that’s incredible 14 Boston marathons!

It's important to remember that first and foremost you are her friend that she confided in and you have no obligation to see that she gets the help that she needs. However, it's also important to note that she confided in /you/. She might be realizing that she has a problem and is trying to seek support when she doesn't necessarily know how to. Maybe sit down for coffee together and have a chat about how she's doing and what she thinks is best for her at the moment. Remember to not pressure her into seeing anyone or confessing anything as that could influence her behaviors. 

*if there comes a time where you are becoming increasingly more and more concerned with her behaviors and well-being, sitting down with a closer friend, sibling, or guardian and telling them that you are concerned is a good idea (remember though that it's best to keep the details to yourself, as she could see that as a breach of trust.

if your weight is down and your aim is to gain back the weight and maintain at your stable recovery weight, then there are certain nutritional/higher calorie items you can eat/drink to aid in this. i am not sure what exactly your GI thing is or the diet your doctor has you on, but some ideas that you can ask your doctor if they are ok to fit into your diet are:

ensures, boosts, and other nutritional drinks.

protein powder to add to liquids or can even add into foods (like pancake mix or baked goods for example) can be an easy way to get in nutrients. i know protein can be difficult to get in with GI issues, so this can be a good option is applicable.

Magic Cup: literally taste like cake frosting omg these things are kinda like an ice-cream-ish frozen dessert thing, but full of nutritional calories. they taste so dang delicious! highly recommend the vanilla flavor topped with golden grahams cereal

hot chocolate can be a comforting and warm drink to have this time of year and you can also add the protein powder, collagen powder, powdered greens, or other nutritional supplements and they will dissolve in easily

idk if any of these fit your diet but i hope it helped a little and hope you recovery from your gi thing soon! good job being mindful and proactive about preventing relapse! :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He compared it to a child that has a new toy: food is my new toy and I feel like I'll never get tired of it, because I've been restricting myself from it for so long. So the way to deal with this is break the cycle. If you keep restricting yourself, food will always be a reason to obsess over, it will always be ""the new toy"". Try to eat, don't let yourself get hungry and if you binge, it's okay. The guilt will come, but accept it and don't try to make it go way, because that will result in trying to compensate and then you're back on the cycle again. With time it will lose its power, food will stop to seem so important, because eating will become a normal thing. And if you fear eating (I do) just try to always eat a little more everyday. One spoonful of rice at the time... Allow yourself to eat, you are human and need it not only to survive, but also to enjoy. I know that this is easy to say and much more difficult to do...

A soft test helps to feel a bit better in it the next time I wear it, and maybe even tweak it slightly more in the direction I desire my style to go in.",Rubikspheremydear,1576003622.0,2019-12-10 12:47:02,"No friends, much less friends with style haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have learned that a lot of it has developed from trauma around food and my childhood. Being forced to eat certain things and then punished for not eating it. And being force fed and starved constantly. 
But my SPD is a major part of it. Basically my therapist had me write down all the thoughts I have about food when I’m eating. Like, “this feels creepy in my mouth, this tastes like a shoe, this smells like mold, etc.” whatever my thoughts are. And then rebuttals to all of them. Like “you may be right, yes but it has high nutritional value, or maybe it’s not really as slimy as you think you just expect it to be slimy” basically giving objective and neutral observations to validate your concerns but also be kind to yourself. Like you may be right, this smells weird, but it’s a good idea to just try it anyway. Even just one bite. But also, the more you concentrate on getting yourself to eat certain things, the more resistant you will be to those things. So it’s not about forcing but about accepting. 
Also having positive affirmations to read or say out loud, like “I am doing my best. This is the best I can do. I am taking care of myself. I am important. It’s okay to make slow progress. It’s okay to have bad days and bad meals. This is supposed to be difficult, hurting is healing. My body deserves balanced nutrition. My body has preferences and that’s okay and not my fault.” And this has helped me a lot. 
The thoughts become more automatic and you start to believe them. And then it gets less scary to try to eat strange things. 
I will have, for example, most of a food I do like, (chicken nuggets), a bit of a food I feel medium about (peaches), and one bite of a food I really dont like (one green bean). And then it’s a little bit of balance. And adds up and gets easier every time. And if I can’t handle it, I don’t do it.

Along with my general ED therapy, sneaking vegetables into my diet slowly helped a lot. Smoothies were my first step, I mixed frozen spinach in with my fruit smoothies, and was surprised how good they made me feel.  After that  I would chop the ever living shit out of my vegetables (carrots, onions, peppers, asparagus, snap peas, broccoli) until they looked like hippie confetti, saute them, add rice and seasonings, and suddenly I was eating vegetables at least four nights a week. 

It's been a few years now (three-ish) and I've found ways to cook vegetables that I personally really enjoy, especially mushrooms and onions, broccoli is great when cooked in the oven and I really like butternut squash soup. However, I still can't eat raw broccoli, let alone eat any sort of microwaved/steamed vegetable without gagging at the first bite. But that's okay! The end goal is to get the nutrition in and keep it in, doesn't matter how. What's important is doing what works for you and being proud of doing the thing.  

So yeah, maybe just start with one vegetable, it doesn't have to be the most daunting one at all, and try coming at it at a different angle, even if the answer is just throw a bunch of cheese on it, if that works than it works! 

That being said, it is important to figure out the why with a therapist, it might be a trauma thing, a brain chemical thing, a side effect of an ED, who knows.

He saw a therapist about it and that seemed to help some. He still eats like crap but his diet is more varied that it used to be. I think it would be worth it to see a food therapist about it because they see a lot of people in your situation.

I have the same problem but haven't ever addressed it. I'm pretty embarrassed about it so it's nice to know I'm not the only one (besides my brother). I've gotten a bit better and I can stomach some things if I'm in public to look normal but it takes me forever to actually swallow them. I like soup with vegetables but I cook it so much the vegetable are basically mush so I don't have to chew them. Pureeing vegetables has helped me a lot in the past. I puree a bag of mix vegetables with some type of legumes (i usually use lentils or 4 bean mix) to make it thick like oatmeal but you can add stock or water to thin it out. It doesn't look pretty but it tastes good and it's healthy. You can add whatever spices, seasonings, or flavours you like and use whatever vegetables you want to. You can add meat or vegan protein options. I think you could even put unflavoured protein powder in to boost the protein count. Eat it with rice like a curry or as a sauce over pasta if you eat either of them. It's really versatile.

  
Puree-ing is helpful too because you can decide how smooth you want it and in our case, you can try making it a little less smooth sometimes and see how you go.

1256,e0xgip,RuinedSwan,1574614071.0,2019-11-24 10:47:51,"Op, there are some hallmark signs of an eating disorder here. At the very least, a relationship with food that is a big problem. It sounds like you know that by posting in this sub. I'm encouraging you to seek out an ED treatment center and they can tell you if it's truly and eating disorder or not.",kat_eldritch,1574673981.0,2019-11-25 03:26:21,"So when I went into treatment for my 12 year eating disorder, one of the biggest (and most infuriating) mental blocks they shut down was 'should' talk. 

*I should look a certain way* 

*I should've done this already* 

*I shouldn't expect things to go right* 

Practically every single day, someone would tell me 'don't 'should' yourself. 

Another big problem I had was projecting my feelings onto other people without knowing exactly what they were thinking. 

*She's not messaging me because I'm annoying* 

*They didn't invite me on purpose* 

*He doesn't want to be my partner because I'm such a total loser* 

And while it was super annoying and jaring at first to be called out like literally every day for this stuff, what I realized was that everyone else I was in treatment with had the same problem. 

So you can see how a phrase like, 

 *""****it feels*** *like a sign that I* ***shouldn’t*** *have been eating it in the first place""*

can sound really familiar.

To dive into this situation, of these 'signs' that you shouldn't eat, I really want you to try something. Imagine you had been the one to accidentally throw away the naan and the morning your parents or one of your friends said to you, oh I really wanted to eat that and you told them, well maybe this is a sign you shouldn't have eaten it in the first place. Can you imagine their reaction? And then you continue with ""thinking of it, you probably shouldn't have had any of the chicken or veggies or rice either."" Honestly how do you think that would go? And, if you would never talk to them like that, why is it an okay way to talk to yourself. 

*I really just want to sit down and enjoy food but I’m always conscious of how much it ‘costs’.*

So diving into this, I want you really dive into what you think food cost. Personally for a long time food cost me feelings like guilt, depression, unease, bloatedness, embarrassment, and most importantly weight. But that's not true. Food is not a cost, it's not a sinful toll, it's fuel that keeps you alive. You have to eat a certain amount of food every day, every week, every month, and every year or you'll die. Without food you can't circulate blood, you can't focus, you can't run, you can't swim, you can't get pregnant.  

So a small thing I noticed is that in the first paragraph you mentioned still feeling like you looked overweight despite losing enough weight to have your friends and family voiced concern. Then in the last paragraph you say that you get these food related 'symptoms' in this season but they disappear when it gets hotter. Yet, this last summer, you had a six pack and still felt overweight. But you only get these symptoms in fall and winter. You see where I'm going with this?  

I'm really really sorry, but I need to tell you what someone should told me years ago. You can eat healthy every day, only the things you 'should', you can go to the gym for hours every day, you can work and work and restrict and run. You can pretend to not be lightheaded when you stand up too fast, you can pretend to not be hungry, you can secretly throw away treats that your friends make you, you can make excuses to why you don't want to out to eat on a date. But you'll never, ever be able to do that enough to be fully happy, to feel beautiful and right in your skin in a way that's lasting and beyond a number on a scale. Every single day you tell yourself that you shouldn't eat and that you don't have an eating disorder you're walking further and further into a dark miserable hole. 

I'm not saying this to be dramatic or mean, but from experience, girl you need help. You need to want help. Because you're not going to wake up some day in your 30s and this won't be a problem anymore. You deserve to enjoy food, you deserve to be able to think about life beyond food, you deserve to happy. Please reach out to your parents, from what you've shared I don't think it's safe for you to even attempt recovery without help. I hope this is your wakeup call and not a hospital trip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you continue down this path you will probably notice further symptoms like increased/thicker hair (that your body makes to help keep you warmer), brittle bones, low blood pressure, brittle nails, and mood swings/anxiety/depression. Although they technically could be caused by something else, more than likely they are caused by restricting and not giving your body enough nutrients. Try spreading out your meals throughout the day and have lots of snacks; this can help prevent you from feeling like there’s too much on your plate at once. You can also have someone talk to you while you’re eating to help distract your thoughts away from disordered thinking. You can also choose to eat more protein rich food because that’ll help give your body more energy.

If your body is used to frequent binging, then your hunger signals will not be at a place where you can eat intuitively. My meal plan was to eat every 3-4 hours. For example, I'd have breakfast at 8am, lunch at 12pm, a snack at 3pm, and dinner at 6pm. This way, I was never so hungry that I felt the urge to binge, and I knew that I would have another meal in a couple hours, so I didn't feel deprived. Eventually, I got to a place where I could eat intuitively, but trying to do so at first in my recovery would have never worked.",steamricecake,1575260688.0,2019-12-01 22:24:48,"I think jumping right back into intuitive eating can be a difficult transition from binge eating (believe me, I've tried) so it might be smart to have a set amount of meals that are healthy but satiating. make sure to honor your cravings as best as possible without bingeing on them! for example, if you want cake, have a small slice with a side of fruit or maybe yogurt just so you satisfy yourself physically (fullness) and mentally (enjoyment from taste) without eating too much sugar/fat :) I'm still struggling all the time not to overdo it but I find that if I try completely let myself go atm I just make up excuses to eat when I'm not hungry and to binge so having a meal plan where I feel truly hungry for my main meals and can enjoy a snack really helps 💓 best of luck &amp; much love :)",stephwa,1575262173.0,2019-12-01 22:49:33,This is so important,aquariacherry,1575262255.0,2019-12-01 22:50:55,"hi I'm OP :) I actually do relatively ok when I plan out when/what I eat in advance, but do you have any advice for days when you can't follow a plan? For example, during the holidays, I will need to eat out with family so I won't get a choice on what time or what to eat. Like when I'm back with my parents, or in a restaurant, I lose all sense of control and just stuff my face even if I don't enjoy the food.",bulimicomrade,1575262753.0,2019-12-01 22:59:13,"For situations like that, my therapist suggested things like asking the waitress to put half of the meal in a to-go container before bringing the meal to the table. Afterwards, depending on how in-control I felt, I would either throw the leftovers away or freeze them. While I felt horrible about the waste of money, it was necessary until my relationship with food improved.

It's definitely a lot harder to plan out things that are a break in your routine. The best I could do in those situations was plan what I could and when I didn't know what I'd end up eating, I just tried to eat a moderate portion of whatever was available in the time frame I would usually eat at. I still struggle with holidays, but it can help to distract yourself or separate yourself from the food when you get the urge to binge. For example, when my sister bakes christmas cookies, which I've binged on many times in the past, I'm planning on taking a walk to remove myself from the smell.",lupoverde,1575278641.0,2019-12-02 03:24:01,"Your hunger cues will be off, I’m guessing? Also my therapist told me that if you wait until you’re hungry then it’s actually too late (like how if you wait until you’re thirsty then you’re already dehydrated). Which is why intuitive eating for an ED patient doesn’t really work.   

I follow an eating plan now and it’s amazing. 3 small meals with 3 snacks (breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner (with desert), snack) which means I end up eating every few hours. At first it felt like A LOT and like I was eating too much, but I’ve actually remained at a pretty good and consistent weight since I started (I haven’t gained or lost any weight at all, I’m shook). Planning definitely helps, especially with tricky days. Like sometimes you can’t control a specific meal (e.g. family meal) but you can normally plan the rest of the day, and set yourself up for safety so when it comes to that difficult moment you can relax a little more because, even if that one meal was shit at least the rest of your day was fine. 

  For me I struggle the most with timings... but then an eating diary helped me figure out a little more when to compensate for badly planned meals. Like on a weekend, I might not eat my first meal until 12pm, whereas on a normal day I would usually be on my third eating moment (lunch). So on the weekend I just need to be careful that I still eat the same amount (instead of accidentally undereating, which can lead to late night binges). If I eat breakfast at 12 then I know maybe to take an extra slice of toast, maybe have a piece of fruit (snack) an hour later, then have a late lunch at about 3pm. It seems like a lot in a short amount of time but then it’s back to normal again. E.g. Afternoon snack at 4:30ish, dinner at 7pm, evening snack at 9pm. But keeping a diary really helped me because it’s an objective measurement and you can compare your day to the standard plan and work out if you’re on track or need to eat more. Because if you rely on guessing then the ED will trick you in to thinking that you’ve already eaten enough (this always happens to me!!)

  What I also like about the 3 meals and 3 snacks plan is that it allows you to have an evening snack guilt-free, which was great for my binge eating. The plan includes eating a small desert after dinner so I would delay this and eat a larger evening snack, like a combined snack and desert. And so it felt like I was eating “a lot” but it fit into the plan!!! And because you’ve already eaten 5 times that day, by the time it comes to the evening you’re actually pretty full and don’t feel the need to binge eat anymore.",k2s6,1575294718.0,2019-12-02 07:51:58,"Appreciate this a lot, thank you &lt;3",Simplicityobsessed,1575301906.0,2019-12-02 09:51:46,"So..... I don't think I am among the majority here, but some of those accounts can be rather inaccurate, and damaging. I used to be all about the body-posi movement, until they started to normalize binge eating. Just be careful about whose advise you take, and what they are saying! A ""official"" book on intuitive eating exists - if you can afford it, get it! Now, it's a bit old and bland, but it has the ""steps"" and reasoning behind it, so that you don't have to rely on Instagram and such to give you the information! 

(Of course different strokes for different folks, but I have a history of AN &amp; BED, so I have to be careful about all of this).

The first step, is to just let go, and eat what you want, when you want. If you want a bowl of ice cream for breakfast? Do it. If you want a whole pot of pasta and some bread for lunch? Do it. If you want fruit or veggies? Do it. The problem with binge eating, is that we often deprive ourselves physically, and or/mentally, which can lead to increased cravings. So by eating all of the things we want (according to the IE theory), it decreases the ""novelty"" of when we \*finally\* get to have that ""forbidden"" food, and therefore over time, it decreases the desire for it. I mean.... if you only have ice cream once a month, you're more likely to binge on it, since it's so novel and you don't often have it! Yet, if you learn how to just enjoy a little bit when you're in the mood, it equates to what you'd eat during a binge once a month anyways - if not less. (This was the rationale I used, to give it a shot, since I was scared of weight gain and being out of control).

In all honesty? It was super weird for me. I wasn't used to not caring, but it helped me after a week or two, to realize that I was eating most of those foods for the fat I was craving, or sugar, and that after eating them so much, I was just sick of them/ didn't have a huge urge to eat them all of the time. Once your body &amp; mind can trust the fact that you'll let them have those ""trigger foods"" in moderation, they don't see them as so novel and stop pushing you to go for them, and over indulge.

After that, I realized that I needed to learn how to balance what I craved with what I ""knew"" was right for my body intuitively, without restricting. (With my horrific hormone problems around my period and my ADHD meds... if I 100% listened to my body, I'd rarely eat, or over-eat whenever I had an appetite). I didn't follow the book to a T/100%, but it really helped me to realize that what I needed was balance - not in the form of a diet or my macros, but instead in the form of eating what I knew my body liked/what made me feel good, and, treats/indulgences.

I highly suggest getting the book - if you need the name/such let me know - if you happen to be in NJ, I can drop it off for you too (I don't use it anymore, lol). But it's a good place to get started, with a simple layout of the steps you can take, and why/some basic research supporting their theory/approach.

Now? I do a split, like I said, of emotional and rational reasoning; I have stomach issues, POTS, etc., like I mentioned - so sometimes I have to eat healthy, to avoid a flare or feeling worse. But I do my best to balance that with being flexible, and eating when I want, when I want, or having treats to avoid relapsing. It's all about finding what works for you, but the first step is letting go.... which is often the hardest!

If worst comes to worst, remember, that the ED will always be there. You can always relapse if you want to, and if this doesn't work out. So..... why not give it a good honest try? What do you have to lose? :)",Fuckmenumb,1575302506.0,2019-12-02 10:01:46,"I think the other folks here who have therapists that specialize in eating disorders may be some of the best to listen to in this thread.

FWIW, intuitive eating was the ONLY thing that got me to stop my binge and sporadic binge-purge cycle. Every case is different so what worked for one of us might not work for you. 

I allowed myself to have anything and sometimes I binged and felt horrible but focused on the feeling of over-indulging rather than the caloric consequences. The binging petered out relatively quickly for me. The process of learning to listen to hunger cues etc took much much longer but the actual binges themselves slowed and stopped. 

My primary issue seemed to have been having ""no-no"" foods. It broke my brain. So once everything was ok and I re-fed for a couple months, I didn't binge. Your mileage may vary. I will tell you my weight finally stabilized, I stopped obsessing about food, and I can eat a couple bites of ice cream and be done and put it back in the freezer. I NEVER THOUGHT THAT WAS POSSIBLE. 

I really wish you all the best. Keep working with your therapist.

1287,e3dhqi,hurry_up_meow,1575051925.0,2019-11-29 12:25:25,"I was not in treatment for anorexia but I was in an inpatient eating disorder program for BED. They also had a program for anorexia but we were kept separate. However the treatment approach was generally the same.

I had two roommates at a time. I got along well with all but one of them. Food was available at specific times and in specific portions  and they monitored our intake. Even though my disorder is primarily binging, I go through periods where I don’t eat. I would water load. So I wasn’t allowed to drink more than one glass of water during the meal. 

Weigh ins were daily but blind. This was extremely difficult to cope with. There were indeed groups all day. Our rooms were locked during the day. The bathroom was locked and use was monitored. Showers were only allowed at specific times as well. 

It was not easy. I did however meet some wonderful people that I am still friends with. My experience with staff varied but tbh it had a lot to do with my unwillingness to give up control (I’m 41, I think it’s been two years). I did well for a period of time afterward. I’m struggling again (periods of starvation, periods of binging).  I can’t blame the program for that, I’m still working on coping mechanisms and the reasons my eating is so disordered.

Yes, it’s kind of a voluntary/ involuntary thing. They won’t take you unless you sign yourself in. If you sign yourself out early, it’s my understanding that insurance won’t pay. The front door is not locked and you can walk out. Everything going in to places is locked. After you are there for a period of time you do get incrementally longer passes, so you do get to leave. They also took a fair amount of outings to some pretty cool places. I was in a program in downtown Chicago so there were lots of things to see. 

If you are ready to commit, it may be worth it. Just know it may be one of the hardest things you will ever do. I know we don’t have the same eating disorder but at our core psychologically we share a lot.",mattiecasey,1575057838.0,2019-11-29 14:03:58,"I can’t answer all your questions, but I can tell you that mental hospitals vary depending on where you seek treatment. Different areas have access to different resources and funding, so depending on where you live the quality of care could be very good or very bad.

In my experience, there’s both more freedom and less freedom than you’d expect. You CAN leave as long as you’re not a danger to others or completely incapable of caring for yourself. Most treatment centers are voluntary entrance and exit but it gets complicated if you want to leave early, because there can be issues with insurance or progressing your treatment plans. But, they usually won’t force you to stay. Most places have activities you can do during the day, but you’re not always allowed to participate. Sometimes they cycle out patients throughout the hospital to keep groups separate (think: adults with aggression disorders will probably never mix with mentally ill adolescent patients). You’ll probably just stay in your room or some other assigned area during free time.

The hospital I stayed in was lower tier so it wasn’t the best experience. It’s harder when facilities are understaffed and underfunded, but they do their best. Your roommates change often because people are constantly being admitted and discharged. Meals are typically heavily supervised (particularly in eating-disorder oriented programs) but the food itself could honestly be worse. Group therapy sessions are held once or twice a day and are more helpful than you think. Once you get over the anxiety and discomfort of sharing personal things, they can become the key to your recovery. But, everyone’s different so I understand your hesitance.

Communication can feel limiting sometimes. We were allowed internet for certain periods of the day, but what we looked at or used was monitored. We only got one phone call a day during a specific time. Visiting hours were only an hour long and only on specific days of the week, but considering that you’re probably not going to be inpatient for toooo long it’s not the worst thing in the world. These might also be a good time to deal with rent/bills/other things that need your attention, cause then you don’t have to worry about fully discharging yourself to handle them.

The last thing I want to emphasize is that these are not easy places to be. The people who are in these programs are usually seriously ill and facing one of the hardest battles of their lives. The more empathetic you are, the harder it can be to deal with. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go. Seeking treatment is honestly the bravest thing you can do and though you may not feel like it, you’ll come out the other side stronger and better able to confront your obstacles. Focus on you and your recovery and you’ll at least make progress, which is the most important thing!!!",regrettospaghetto,1575059482.0,2019-11-29 14:31:22,Does canada count or just US?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A person whose just on a diet usually just wants to be healthy and feel better about themselves, they’re not overly obsessive about it, and their not negative in a self destructive way when they make a mistake.

It’s the relationship the person has with food and their self image.",Simplicityobsessed,1576155981.0,2019-12-12 07:06:21,"Yes this!! Also to add: eating disorders dont have “a limit” persay; it’s never enough. While diets? Even if they are extreme, come to an end, whether it be a habit ending or a weight goal met.

Like most mental disorders, eating disorders sit on a spectrum. On one end is a health, body-positive attitude and on the other is severely disordered. Those in the severely disordered side can’t think about anything other than food/ED stuff. Their behaviors support this. Whichever form the ED takes, their ED behaviors prevent them from engaging actively in life. Work, school, relationships and of course the physical body are all impacted. Those on the other side, people with a healthy attitude towards food generally don’t spend much time planning out meals/calories and if they do, there isn’t baggage that comes with it. Food is nourishment, eating is a time to socialize and it’s both a source of pleasure or not.
Most people probably sit somewhere in the middle of this spectrum. At least within the US, there are so many mixed messages blasted all over the place about food. Good food vs bad food. Guilty pleasures. Sinfully decadent treats. Clean eating. Comfort food. Natural. We use food and diet as yet another way to compare ourselves to others and even as a source of identity. Not to say that the entirety of the US has an eating disorder, but that we have many weird hang ups with food that aren’t as prevalent in other cultures. Maybe we’re slightly further along the spectrum than say a native tribesman somewhere eating indigenous cuisine.

So what are signs that you’re slipping closer towards the disordered side of things?
Becoming obsessive about food. You think about food all the time. What to eat, what to make, what ingredients can you have/not have.
You focus on the data of food: calories, macros, micros, etc. 
You calculate what you can eat based on how much exercise you got (or vice versa)
What you eat affects how you feel about yourself
What you eat forms part of your identity
You use food to fulfill needs other than hunger
You use food/lack of food/exercise to manage your emotions
Your focus on food/body/exercise impacts your ability to take part in relationships
Your focus on food/body/exercise impacts your ability to work/go to school
Your food/exercise choices are having a negative impact on your body but you continue.

I feel like some of these signs may fire up some people. I don’t mean to say that if you do any of the above you have an eating disorder or even that you have disordered eating. We all know plenty of people who pursue health/nutrition goals and don’t appear to have anything disordered going on. Athletes in particular could probably check off many of these without crossing into disordered territory, but there are plenty of athletes who have eating disorders and who are able to hide all the red flags.
So back to your original question - who has the eating disorder and who doesn’t? I don’t think there’s a one size fits all answer to this. I’ve seen student athletes push their bodies passed the breaking point but denied any body image concerns. I’ve seen people obsessed with their body image and their food intake, but they were functioning, at a healthy weight and seemed happy. I’ve seen people who wanted to gain weight, enjoyed their bodies, exercised appropriately, but were chronically underweight. ED diagnoses are a way to attempt to categorize symptomology, but most people are complex and don’t fit into nice pretty boxes. There are certainly clear cases where someone is in the clinically disordered realm, but for those in the grey middle ground, I don’t think there is a clear cut answer.",paradoxrevel,1576170504.0,2019-12-12 11:08:24,"This is accurate. Culturally, we have normalized dieting. But dieting is very much a disordered relationship to food and internal hunger and fullness cues.

Depends on the circumstanced in my life currently or what triggers are around me.

The difference to me would be how much it affects their life.

A fear of food and a fear of gaining weight are tell tale signs that something more than a diet is going on. This also means that if the person has a poor self-esteem and a poor image of themself, they're at a higher risk of developing an eating disorder. A person who accepts themselves as they are but wants to improve themself for their health or enjoyment is the basis of a healthy diet, as well as knowing when to stop their diet. Some people who develop eating disorders believe that losing weight will make them loveable, beautiful, worthy and so on without realizing that they are already all of those things. Diet culture influences this a lot, whether directly or indirectly. Although, some people don't develop eating disorders because of their body image, or really even anything related. A good percentage of people with eating disorders are addicted to the false sense of control, not their body image. When the world around them is chaotic, they find comfort and control by limiting their intake, or practicing 'self-discipline' by exercising excessively. Personally, I believe that diet culture is extremely overrated because dieting is a slippery slope to unhealthy habits. While not everyone who diets will develop an eating disorder of some type, the culture that surrounds dieting really influences the idea that 'thin' means 'healthy and beautiful' when realistically, everyone's healthy range is different. Fat is not synonymous with bad or ugly, nor is thin synonymous with beautiful and worthy. It's something I'm still trying to learn, myself. To sum it up and answer your question, though, it all really boils down to their state of mind through it all. A healthy mind leads to a healthy diet, otherwise it's just a downward slope into dangerous territory.",nietheo,1576188357.0,2019-12-12 16:05:57,"For me, dieting led to my eating disorder. I was overweight (obese, actually) and started out just trying to lose some weight, feel better, and be more active. All fine. The problem was once I got to my goal weight, I couldn't stop..I was in the middle of a divorce and I know that didn't help. I was obsessed, afraid of many foods, and couldn't enjoy eating. All I thought about was what I ate, fearing it was too much, etc. I got very thin, even underweight. After a few tears of that I snapped one day and binged, then freaked out and purged, and then that cycle set up shop for a few years. My therapist told me that for those who are already predisposed to developing an ED, dieting and stress can pull the trigger, so to speak, but the gun was already loaded.

Eating disorders are a mental illness like depression, anxiety etc. They’re in the DSM. Yes both have destructive behaviors, but the difference is that the disordered eating worst case tragic end is it developing into an eating disorder. The worst case tragic end with an eating disorder is dying. 

Seeing as how there are multiple types of eating disorders, there are many different symptoms. An unhealthy relationship with food and unhealthy eating habits (eg. disordered eating) are a symptom of eating disorders. 

I personally believe dieting is a form of disordered eating. Because you’re forcing your body to not listen to it’s needs/cravings in order to meet some goal other than meeting nutritional needs and satisfying yourself. That doesn’t mean everyone who diets has an eating disorder. 

Someone else mentioned how a key thing is impact and longevity. For instance a “normal” person who’s on a diet may eat a piece of cake or a big meal and feel guilty because they broke their meal plan, but this guilt fades rather quickly. They can go about the rest of their day/week without interference. For me, someone with an eating disorder, when I would eats outside my “meal plan” I would think about it constantly and I mean every second of the day for weeks. For example, I ate mac and cheese on Monday for dinner and to this day it’s *still* running through my mind every time i try to choose and eat a meal.",imthedough,1576199872.0,2019-12-12 19:17:52,Thank you! that helped clear my questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EDs are not all about the food. The food/behaviors are used as a mechanism through which you fulfill some needs of yours. Try to take some time to reflect on how you’re feeling when you’re eating. What’s your emotional state? What need is not being met? Are you lonely? Are you angry? Do you need comfort? Are you bored? Spend time getting to know your food/eating habits.

*Anorexia:* food=fear/guilt. You LOVE food but you can't eat and you count every single calorie. Your body is screaming because you've starved for days but that pain in your empty stomach makes you proud. You look yourself in mirror and smile when you see bones, pale skin, thigh gap but when you don't notice any weight lose you spit in mirror and starve more and more until it makes you smile. You feel weak, sleepy but you don't want to sleep because you feel dirty and like you haven't burned enough calories. You exercise until your ankles hurt and you muscles are sore... Unless you've lost most of your muscles and you can't even exercise anymore. You avoid events, people, you just want to be home, exercise, distract yourself from food and starve and then eat as little as possible usually always the same exact food. [For example I ate only specific brand of oat [10g] with 150 ml almond milk and 2 strawberries a day, every day] I would lose up to 1 kg/ 5 lbs a day and I weighed myself every morning. I was eventually hospitalized for 2 months because I was so skinny I wasn't even able to walk. 


*Bulimia:* This came after I recovered from anorexia. I would binge and eat until I felt sick and then felt the need to get rid of all this food so I did. I would throw up until I felt empty and dizzy. This would happen every single night. I came to my apartment after collage them binged, threw up, shower, sleep. Repeat. I enjoyed while I was binging but also I felt to guilty I would cry myself to sleep and begged myself to stop this hell... And eventually I did when I fainted in public and ended up in hospital.

I think we as commenters have to be careful about our suggestions whenever it comes to food/eating because we obviously don't know the whole medical picture. I'm not a dietician and typically I would refer anyone with eating issues to a dietician first to make sure the basic nutrients are being covered. But you've tried that without significant results.

So how would you like things to be different? Do you want to gain weight? Do you want to be able to eat more? If so, you're going to need to change what you've been doing, and it will probably be uncomfortable. It seems like whatever you're doing right now is maintaining what you have. So if you want to gain weight, you're going to have to eat more, or more calorically dense items. Your stomach is going to feel more full than it has in the past but part of the process is to get your stomach used to different, larger amounts of food. Shakes and smoothies are often good fits because you can add lots of stuff to them to boost the nutrition without making them taste substantially different.

I would also check with a gastroenterologist as you might have delayed gastric emptying after not eating enough for so long (it causes atrophy of the GI tract), if so they can prescribe something like reglan to help with that early fullness. You may also be zinc deficient after eating so little for so long which can contribute to taste changes and food aversions. 

There is also a significant impact of anxiety on the GI system - slowing it down, speeding it up, changing hunger cues. I would certainly discuss the anxiety symptoms with a therapist as treating the anxiety might make eating a lot easier, even improving your physics symptoms. Sometimes gastroenterologist even have therapists they can recommend that work specifically with GI concerns. 

If I HAD to give you an ED diagnosis I would go with ARFID, but a lot of people don’t meet all the criteria for any specific disorder. It doesn’t seem weight-related, but it is impacting your weight which is a significant concern. I would start with the anxiety and gastroenterology and go from there.

I can go all day without eating anything, not because I don't want to, but because I can't identify anything I would like to eat and that indecisiveness leads me to not eat until I have terrible cramps or light headedness.

If he's not helping, go see someone who can help:

A) you learn how to communicate what you need 
B) provide you the tools/support to fight this thing
C) get the two of you in the same room for couples therapy or is willing to work with both of you on a 1-1 basis to help come up with a plan of action.

First, I will say professional help, or at least telling a close and trusted person would be advisable but I know how hard that can be so I'll give you some other advice as well. Know that it will take time to heal yourself, so try, try, try again even when you ""fail"" over and over again—recovery is a process, and it is possible. I know that it is tempting to try and cut the binging habit first, but what is 1000x more effective is to cut the purging/restricting habit. Every time you purge or restrict your body goes into ""I need calories, I need food"" mode and the urge to binge feels uncontrollable. So as hard as it may be—resist the urge to purge, even if you binged. If you let yourself eat your body will slowly realize that nourishment is reliable and the urge to over eat and binge will subside (with time). I know that once a binge happens you feel the need to rid yourself of those calories, but believe me this is long term thing to end, and the more you can hold off on purging/restricting the more stable you will become. Next time you feel the need to purge (after a binge or a normal meal/snack) distract yourself—take a nap, call a friend, do homework, anything! The more you control food, the more it controls you. Next time you feel like you need to skip a meal, or restrict—try not to, I know it's hard, but healing takes time. You will get to a place eventually when you think about food/calories less and less once you give your body what it needs—regular and sustainable nourishment. This is not an easy thing to overcome, but believe me it is so worth it. And baby steps are the key! I know you don't feel comfortable telling anyone, but opening up to one person, even if it is a friend is super helpful. And you can tell them, ""hey I'm going to tell you something, and I don't really want advice, I just want to open up, do you mind just being an ear to listen?"". Believe me, you are not alone in this, it is nothing wrong with you—eating disorders are terrible, but you are strong enough to conquer it.

I also invite you to check out SMART Recovery online, a behavioral-based addiction mutual help group. The eating disorders meeting is Saturday 4pm CST with a second starting in 2020.

The electrolyte changes and weight fluctuations are so very hard on your heart. Even if we’re assuming that weight is a top factor in heart disease (needs better research that accounts for lifestyle differences), the vast majority of people who binge and purge will gain weight in the long run. 

Additionally - “overweight” and even “obese” individuals who incorporate cardio exercise regularly are actually at a lower risk of all cause mortality than thin individuals who do not exercise (several studies from the Cooper clinic show this). 

I know the binging/purging part feels like the shameful/bad part &amp; the part that you want to change. It is also so very intertwined with the restriction and really can’t be resolved without resolving the restriction. I’m an eating disorder dietitian and with my binging or b/p clients I always focus on reducing restriction first to prevent nutritional/physiological triggers of binging. I know that weight loss seems so important right now, but it really has to be placed on the back burner in order to recover. 

If you’re hesitant to tell your parents what’s going on specifically, maybe you could find a specialized therapist and say you need support with body image, or a specialized dietitian and say you need support with emotional eating. You don’t have to tell them everything, and it might be a less scary way to get the help you need. I’ve had several parents come to me with their kids about weight concerns, but wanting to do no harm so wanting an ED-informed RD - when I sit down with their kid it often turns out there’s more going on.

Trying to do it on your own makes it 10x harder.
While you’re building up the courage and waiting for your appointments to get lined up, start working on some “bibliotherapy”- ie, read some books. I never like the Brain over Binge Book or the Hello Ed one, but see what’s available at a local library or what you can get access to free online. Do a google search for dbt worksheets/ cbt worksheets and start trying out the exercises. ED can be seen as a collection of behaviors that you’ve been using to help manage emotions. In order to stop the ED behaviors, you’ll have to get a handle on your emotions- first learning what emotions are there when you’re having urges to use and then figuring out how to tolerate them in the moment. Obviously, easier said than done. BUT you can start by getting a better sense of what’s going on in your head right before binges/purges. The situation beforehand, your thoughts in the moment, etc. You can find worksheets to print and prompt you but it will give you a little bit of a head start on the therapy process.",yedzit,1575801115.0,2019-12-08 04:31:55,first of all u need to break this cycle. stop dieting,lilaccomma,1575963972.0,2019-12-10 01:46:12,I’m in sort of the same boat atm and I’ve taken out ‘Getting Better Bite by Bite- A survival kit for sufferers of bulimia nervosa and binge eating’ from my local library.

I can only imagine how hard that past year or so has been on you to try and talk all of this alone.
I’m not an RD (dietician) so maybe if one reads this they can join in and offer some hard data on the point. It’s not uncommon for those going through the refeeding process to enter a period of increased hunger. It’s basically your metabolism kicking back into gear. Similarly, it is not uncommon to have an increase in ED related thoughts as your weight returns to “normal” and eventually settles at a set point. That’s why it can be so helpful to work with a dietician who can be monitoring your intake and give you the reassurance that you’re eating what you need to instead of basing what you need on your weight and what your head is telling you.
You say you’re afraid that you may be developing BED, and your hunger/what your eating is more than what is “normal” for you. Do you feeling what you’ve been doing is a full “binge”. Binges are subjective, but there are still qualities of them that stands out in comparison to just eating more. do you find that you’re eating more rapidly than usual? Eating in secret? Feeling like you can’t stop eating? If you do feel like you’re starting to binge eat, this would suggest that the emotional roots of the ED haven’t been addressed, even if one of the symptoms (restricting) had been stopped.

The food that I mostly eat now is pretty much all junk food, so it’s higher in calories than some other foods.

Try to be gentle to yourself, if you can, and maybe look into self-compassion exercises: while it's okay (and completely understandable) that your body image is currently causing you distress, you are so much more than whatever number your scale spits out. 

Rather than pursuing weight loss, which other activities could you take up to enrich your life? Which parts of yourself would you like to reconnect with? Let's play the tape forward and suppose that you did lose weight - what would your life look like? What would you be doing then that you aren't doing now?

I do not currently work with the ED population, but I do see it fairly often, probably because I do work in inpatient psychiatric settings.

I'm going out on a limb here, but has anyone mental health provider (e.g, psychologist, psychiatrist, GP, social worker, etc) ever mentioned a purely behavioral approach towards the cessation or treatment of your pica?  I'm talking Classical and Operant Conditioning.  I'm just thinking out loud (or typing) here, but the goal is to unlearn or modify a behavior that you want to stop, but can't for whatever reason(s).  By pairing, say, parafin wax with a naturally aversive stimulus, the strength of your desire to eat wax would lessen/decrease over time.  With operant conditioning, there are certainly methods of reinforcement/punishment that could be individualized to target your specific behaviors.  

What might be tricky is tackling the array of items you find appetizing, and that the list of these items may not be exhaustive.  Creating a hierarchy of the most harmful and appealing down to the least harmful and take them or leave them items might be a possible approach.  

I just want to point out, I am a clinical/forensic psychologist, I am not an expert in purely behavioral approaches, but I have received plenty of training.  I found your case interesting, and I can only imagine how you and many others must feel about living with this.  I just wanted to offer a potential suggestion, which may or may not turn on a lightbulb in your or someone else's head.

I'm not saying its not a good thing for anyone, but its not good for me. At first I felt secretly proud if I did more than I planned but you just have to keep reminding yourself why you're there.

The shitty truth is; over half of the individuals at any gym are there to lose weight. Fatphobia and society's disordered outlook on bodies is everywhere, and especially prevalent in an atmosphere designed to help people 'burn calories'. It's always going to be a little bit triggering, and I encourage you to wait until you're 100% ready to ignore all of that BS before putting yourself in that environment again.

You said that you don't even want to go, and forcing yourself to isn't healthy.  I know that for me, wanting to ""get healthy,"" as you mentioned, can be a very disordered thought and a way that those old behaviors can creep back in.  Even if the intentions aren't fully disordered from the outset, they can quickly become that way.  

I'm not sure the status of your recovery, but based on my own experiences with relapse it's my firm belief that a person should be in stable recovery for a significant period of time before reintroducing exercise (if exercise was a part of their ED behaviors).  I know that many people don't agree with me and of course everyone's recovery is different.  I just know from my recovery and from what I've seen with friends that it can be easy to convince yourself that you're all better and jump back into exercise too soon.

I also think that even if you decide that you're fully ready to start an exercise routine again, avoiding the gym at this point is still a good idea.  Find other ways to move your body:  do yoga, go on a bike ride, go ice skating, join a tennis club.  There are so many ways to move your body that don't involve a physical gym, and often those ways are going to be more enjoyable anyway.  I've also found that less structured forms of movement can be less triggering, although we still have to be careful of course.  But if the gym brings back so many bad memories, there's absolutely no reason to go back right now (or ever, if you don't want to).  It's possible to have a healthy activity level without stepping foot in a gym and the most important thing is avoiding situations that could cause relapse.",coachjennyeden,1576939721.0,2019-12-21 08:48:41,"I feel like this is very common and actually happened to me as well.

*Anorexia:* food=fear/guilt. You LOVE food but you can't eat and you count every single calorie. Your body is screaming because you've starved for days but that pain in your empty stomach makes you proud. You look yourself in mirror and smile when you see bones, pale skin, thigh gap but when you don't notice any weight lose you spit in mirror and starve more and more until it makes you smile. You feel weak, sleepy but you don't want to sleep because you feel dirty and like you haven't burned enough calories. You exercise until your ankles hurt and you muscles are sore... Unless you've lost most of your muscles and you can't even exercise anymore. You avoid events, people, you just want to be home, exercise, distract yourself from food and starve and then eat as little as possible usually always the same exact food. [For example I ate only specific brand of oat [10g] with 150 ml almond milk and 2 strawberries a day, every day] I would lose up to 1 kg/ 5 lbs a day and I weighed myself every morning. I was eventually hospitalized for 2 months because I was so skinny I wasn't even able to walk. 


*Bulimia:* This came after I recovered from anorexia. I would binge and eat until I felt sick and then felt the need to get rid of all this food so I did. I would throw up until I felt empty and dizzy. This would happen every single night. I came to my apartment after collage them binged, threw up, shower, sleep. Repeat. I enjoyed while I was binging but also I felt to guilty I would cry myself to sleep and begged myself to stop this hell... And eventually I did when I fainted in public and ended up in hospital.

There are some things you probably already know but are really hard to put into practice: if you restrict a lot, you will end up bingeing. It’s inevitable. Your body NEEDS food. I also find it really hard not to restrict before/during the holidays in anticipation of a big meal or event. But it always ends with me regretting the restriction because it leads to such a big binge, which makes me feel terrible physically and emotionally. The only way to avoid this is to actually eat more (I hate to say eat “normally” because I still struggle to understand what that means), and not “save up.” I know that’s so much easier said than done, but one thing you could try is eating small meals throughout the day. Any way you do it, you need to eat to avoid bingeing. And keep seeing your therapist (is there any way they’re available by phone?)! I’m sorry I don’t have better advice but your post really resonated with me and I want you to know you’re not alone. This is super hard! But we’ll get through it!",tsar_monty,1576599134.0,2019-12-17 10:12:14,"I empathize with you – any holiday is hard for us to manage. It's really easy for the mind to convince itself that it's in control by restricting and feeling validated for being 'perfect' by doing so. If you slip up, you've completely failed and ruined everything. The anxiety skyrockets and self-worth drops to nothing. I get it. I've been in the same boat many, many times and especially over previous holidays. This is the first year after undergoing a a really successful recovery. I feel tested right now to restrict, try to be perfect in the days leading up to the holidays, and generally feel worthless. What helps me catching those thoughts right away and picking them apart. I try to understand why they're coming up, and realize I don't want to feel the emotions I'm feeling as a result. I want to feel strong, present and in the moment while I'm with my family and friends. I've realized that my life can end at any moment, as it almost has on a few occasions for me. Why am I wasting my time spending it endlessly worrying, restricting my food and obsessing over it? Wouldn't I want to be happy, present and focused instead?

I have no idea why, I don’t even have anything wrong with me. (Or at least, that’s what I’m telling myself...) To be honest, I’d be probably be forced to listen to what several people are telling me and accept that I do have a disorder, if it weren’t for the fact that this Christmas I’m still eating the dinners my family cook.

I’ve been doing the same things as you because I don’t want to gain loads of weight at Christmas. Without using any numbers, I can say that I have been eating literally as little as I can get away with. And doing exercise. I’ve done everything I can to lose as much as possible this December. I’m getting all the same side effects too. I wake up dreaming of food. I can’t think of anything else. I can’t focus. I feel sick. I even managed to faint the other day after exercising so much that I burned more calories than I ate that day. All so that during Christmas I can eat the huge dinners my family prepare, (still skipping the other meals though, when I can.) without becoming fatter than I was when December began.

I can’t imagine how bad Christmas would be for someone with a real problem though. Your experience sounds absolutely awful and I wish I could help you. Even though I can’t help, I want to wish you luck with everything though, since I’m sure you can find some way to be happy at Christmas regardless of what happens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve struggled with anorexia/bulimia for fifteen years and never found reason enough in myself to get better or even attempt to.

I trained for about 2 years before I started deadlifting, and even then it took me about 2 months before I became comfortable with my technique and began increasing my load past a plate on each side.

If she has a history of body issues, approach the topic gently. Don't bring it out of nowhere, but slowly lead to it. When she notices what you're doing, PUSH ON. Don't back down. If you back down and decide to leave the topic at that, she'll learn how to dodge the subject better or she will start avoiding you. 

Trust me, that's what I did when my sister bluntly asked me what's up with my fear of food. I pretended nothing was wrong and learned to cover my tracks better.

If you somehow don't get her to open up, don't nonchalantly bring up her food problems around other people. Don't try to get a reaction out of her. She'll just close off even more. She'll want to eat around you even less.

I'm sorry I gave you no solutions. I'm in the thick of my ED and my family lowkey knows about it. They know my tricks and I know theirs. It's a game of dodgeball every day, especially during holidays. 

Just act normal towards your sister. Don't be too nice or too mean. Talk to her about it as if you're asking her about her crush or latest hobby. Slowly let her know she needs help and you're there to offer it.

Best of luck to both of you. And happy holidays!",[deleted],1577129311.0,2019-12-23 13:28:31,[deleted],_NGC_,1577129353.0,2019-12-23 13:29:13,"This is really useful advice, I’ll be sure to not come on too strongly when bringing it up. Merry Christmas!",the_scientist52,1577146284.0,2019-12-23 18:11:24,"In my mind there are always two ways to approach someone who you suspect has an ED, and the right choice definitely depends on the person's situation (which unfortunately can be hard for you to know as an outsider).  

The first option is the slow, gentle way that I know a lot of people recommend.  This involves not pushing hard at all, and trying to slowly bring up that you've noticed some concerning habits.  Maybe saying something like ""I noticed you didn't eat much today, is everything okay?""  and then sort of going from there.  The pros of this option are that you might be able to gain her trust and have her not shut you out since you aren't pushing her too hard and aren't seeming overly confrontational about it.  On the other hand, this method can take a while and you do run the risk of her just being more sneaky.  

The second way to go about it is the very blunt way.  Sit her down one night and flat-out say that you know she's been using unhealthy behaviors for a while now.  Express your concern and recommend that she seek some form of treatment as soon as possible.  I think that getting your mom involved would be good for this option because while you can't force your sister into anything, your mom has a bit more power and would be able to get the ball rolling on treatment.  I'm sure it would be hard since your mom isn't confrontational, but I really think she needs to be on board so that you guys can be a sort of united front.   Obviously being too confrontational can feel too much like an intervention or too forceful, and could result in your sister becoming defensive and shutting down.  But on the positive side, this way gets things moving a lot more quickly which is important because the sooner an ED sufferer can admit their struggles and begin making changes, the better their chances are of a full recovery.  

I can imagine it's hard to decide what's going to be best for your sister, since there are pros and cons to any method.  I more often see people recommending that you be gentle, slow, and not overwhelm the person, and I think that's a very valid point.  It could be helpful for a person who strongly doesn't want to get better and would feel too forced if you were blunt about it.  However, it's true that some people with eating disorders, on some level, *want* to be confronted.  They see that life with an ED is hard and want to be able to make changes, but feel stuck and unable to do it on their own because the disordered part of them is so strong.  Those people can benefit from another person stepping in, taking control, and providing some support to help fight the eating disorder.  Obviously there are many people who don't benefit from this approach, but the truth is that I really would have--I wish someone in my family had stepped in when I was a teenager and gotten me the help I needed before the ED had become such a deep part of me.",_NGC_,1577149060.0,2019-12-23 18:57:40,Thanks a lot for such a detailed response. I think I’m going to go with the soft approach to begin with but if I feel that’s going no where then being more blunt is likely the route I’ll take. I’m confident she’ll listen to me though as I’m definitely someone who gives people a lot of space and so I’m hoping she’ll recognise me asking her about it as a way of me trying to help her.

I also think its important you talk to your mother about therapy/treatment options because I know the only way I would have been able to make it through my eating disorder was through professional help.

I'm grateful to my sister for doing that now. 

The sooner your sister gets help, the better. The best thing would be to have her talk to a good therapist with experience in EDs. Perhaps mention to your Mom that the problem will not go away on its own by tip-toeing around it, it can only get worse without support.

When I was deep in my eating disorder, all I wanted was for someone to notice. I didn't outwardly try to get attention or anything, I just wanted people to show that they cared. I knew that I looked that I was dying, and wondered why nobody worried.

It was because they were scared to talk to me about it.

This wasn't without reason. Whenever anyone would bring up my eating habits (especially during meals) I would get really closed off and defensive.

One day, though, I was texting a guy I liked. When I texted him it felt like a was just screaming into the void, especially since I hadn't seen him all summer. All day I had been trying to decide whether to eat a bowl of chowder that was in my fridge. I asked what he thought I should do, eat it or not, and he said to eat it, it's not that complicated. I said it was, really complicated. It went on like that for a while.

Finally, he said ""I'm just concerned that you're not eating is all.""

That made me cry, but in a good way. See, when people asked if I had an eating disorder, I couldn't deal with that. When people seemed like they were judging me, I couldn't deal. But he was concerned. He cared. 

I ended up brushing it off anyways, but it stuck with me. If he had wanted to have a talk with me about it after that, I probably would have opened up.

He also wasn't challenging me. He wasn't saying he was going to stop me or try to change things. When people offer help to people with eating disorders they will get pushed away, because when you have an eating disorder you DO NOT WANT TO BE STOPPED. 

I think the best way to help someone with an ED is to make it seem like you're not trying to fix them.

1333,edune7,princessonania,1576959617.0,2019-12-21 14:20:17,"i think if hes feeling a lot of anxiety around food its worth bringing up.

he may not show the symptoms of an eating disorder, but behaviour like purposefully skipping meals and eating a huge amount later (usually accompanied by feeling out of control around food), not eating much at all or being unusually extremely picky are all disordered eating habits.

diets can quickly spiral out of control, although many can go on a diet and be okay if they lose weight or not, oftentimes they are abused as a way to gain control in your life.

i would recommend talking to him. you dont have to bring up eating disorders, just ask how hes been feeling, say youve noticed he has been as bit more anxious recently, that hes been quite picky around food but that youre just wondering if hes okay (not anything to do with the food itself)(im not sure if that makes sense sorry).

edit: also if it turns out hes just on a very strict diet, try suggesting healthier ways to go about it. binge eating recovery focuses on small but often meals (that arent too restrictive in food types or portions or calories) so you dont get too hungry and go all out.

keep your eye out for anything else worrying and just make sure to be a shoulder to lean on. try not to comment on his food habits or his weight a lot. best wishes!! x",heresthebite,1576965471.0,2019-12-21 15:57:51,"it sounds like this could be an anxiety disorder linked to eating in front of other people. a very close male friend of mine once dropped probably 30-40 pounds because he developed it, and I’ve heard of others with the same. he would eat normally at home and sometimes with me or his girlfriend, but regularly get stomachaches or throw up if he had to eat in front of other people. it wasn’t a body image thing at all. of course, I don’t know everything about the situation or your husband’s mental health history, but possibly worth looking into?",macabrasive,1576970820.0,2019-12-21 17:27:00,"This happens to me.

I do notice some food restriction at home, but traveling and being away from his preferred foods seems to exacerbate the problem. 

I first noticed it at a hotel we stayed at that had a pretty decent breakfast spread (fresh fruit, omelettes, breakfast sandwiches made fresh, etc.) None of this was acceptable and he just ended up having a coffee and a handful of peanuts that he brought from home. One day they had bananas out, so he had that. Otherwise it was just peanuts. When I asked him why he didn't want any of the food, all he would say is that he just doesn't feel good when he eats ""stuff like that.""

He is normally a muscular person and it has been so hard seeing him become tinier and tinier. He will eat a fairly normal amount of dinner at home and a wide variety of food, but breakfast is always a plate of raw kale and some pretzels. I do think this has roots in anxiety as we've had some hard stuff going on in our lives over the last year. I look at pictures of him from a couple years ago and it makes me so sad to see how healthy and strong he used to look. 

When I brought up how worried I am it really wasn't received well. He thinks I am overreacting and trying to control his body, and I definitely don't want to make him feel a lack of control because that's where I think this behavior is coming from in the first place, so I just don't bring it up any more. 

I feel really helpless and stressed about this. Like you, I haven't found this exact problem in eating disorder research, so I don't know what it really is, other than some concerning eating habits made worse by a change in routine. I have had mutual friends pull me aside to ask if he's battling cancer or other significant health problems.

The best way I can describe my personal relationship with symptoms is like an itch. It’s really itches, but logically you know it won’t make it better to scratch it. Yet the itch is constant, so hard to ignore, it drives you bonkers and you can’t sleep or distract yourself and so finally you scratch it. And in the moment it feels like such a relief to scratch it, but it’s temporary relief. 

Try looking into support groups in your area, I’ve found that having a place to go to talk about it for like 1.5 hours every week (or even just when needed) helps me refocus my life on recovery. Sometimes life is hectic and it’s easy to forget how important keeping a recovery mindset is. They are also great places to get resources as a support person, and most will welcome a support person by themselves if you just want to go to talk about your fears and get advice. 

I would talk to her, but keep in mind that it’s an itch, it’s not a logical, sober choice to hurt herself. Be clear that you love her and you’re here to support her through even the toughest of feelings, and you know that it’s not just her making harmful choices but a reaction to the itch.

The ""I hardly ever do it, I can stop whenever I want, it's not a big deal"" line is something that so many ED sufferers use to throw off suspicion and convince loved ones that they're okay.  I don't mean that judgmentally because I have definitely done it as well.  It's just a fact that these behaviors are rarely a one-time thing and that people who have eating disorders usually minimize their symptoms to avoid confrontation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first question is are you bingeing in the sense that you have periods where you eat so much that you feel physically I'll? And feel almost out of control, kind of as if you are dreaming, when it happens? Or are you just eating more then you'd like to be when you arent even necessarily hungry. I. E. Having a normal sized dinner and then eating geo bags of potato chips (I believe you call then crisps) or 6 cookies before bed,  or something along those lines.
Once you distinguish those two, it will help determine how you can improve those habits without harming yourself.  Please, please do not consider vomiting/purging. I promise you dont want to go down that deep, dark path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tell her that you are worried about her and her recent weight loss. Tell her that you have noticed her relationship to food seems to have changed (whether that be over exercising, vomiting, or restricting to compensate). You could also mention that you did some research and the physical ailments that she has sought to address in the past could be a result of an eating disorder. Tell her that all you want to do is help her and that you are there for her because you want her to get better. 
I wouldn’t approach her teacher about it before approaching her. It could seem like a major overstepping of boundaries on your part and it could worsen the problem. You also need to accept that if she is not ready to receive help then your efforts may not change anything. She will not get better mentally if she is not ready to do so. 
Finally, I would recommend that you tell your sister she needs to tell someone else about the issues she is experiencing. She needs to be the one to reach out for help. 

Sending well wishes. Good luck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deciding to WANT to change is a huge step and unfortunately often comes from a lot of pain and loss. Even so, capitalize on this feeling NOW. Motivation ebbs and flows, so while you’re still even interested in the idea of giving it up, even if you’re not ready to actually do so, start gathering resources. Grab some recovery focused books and start becoming more comfortable with the idea of recovery.
EDs are insidious and corrupt your brain into thinking about all the awful consequences of recovery. But they fail to fully acknowledge what you have to sacrifice in order to keep an ED. Give yourself a minute to sit and really do pros/cons list for recovery vs staying in the ED. And I mean REALLY do it. You say you’re afraid of the weight gain, but what does the weight piece mean for you if you’d have to give it up? Is it identity? A sense of being special or more disciplined than others? Confidence? Feeling attractive? Then flip it- what would you have to give up and continue to give up if you choose to keep going down your current path? 
Ultimately only you can decide which path is more align with the values you want for your life.

They persisted anyway, even though I knew they were ridiculous and false. For me, I really benefited from acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) which is more focused on mindfulness and value-based decision-making. Doing ACT, I was  able to gradually NOT act on the disordered thoughts. Even though they were still present, I could accept that my thoughts were not me and did not dictate me. The more I challenged myself in different situations and went against these thoughts, the more the thoughts dissipated- BUT that took time and the only way out was through.

Hopefully it will go away, but first I have to normalise my eating habits... which isn’t easy; today I’ve only had one meal and tomorrow I’ll probably only have one again because I should be able to get away with it.

I always end up thinking: “I feel better when I starve, so why does it matter if it’s just an ED messing with me?”, and then struggle to make myself eat. Sometimes I can tell how bad it is and what it’s doing to me, and I miss eating the foods I like, and I worry about what’s going to happen since I’m already suffering several of the bad side of effects of starvation, even my heart is starting to beat strangely sometimes. Other times I feel like doing it is a good thing I don’t want to stop because that will make starting again harder.

I really don’t want to have anything extra tomorrow. The idea of eating before going out, even if I skip lunch and just have breakfast in the morning, is really scary to me. Thinking about eating popcorn is even worse. It’s just so many calories... and all that sugar, completely blown on popcorn. I’ve cut all snacks out of my diet, except for when I’ve slipped and lost control at Christmas and eaten a Toblerone and a few sweets, so I don’t feel up to eating some suddenly. But even the breakfast would make me feel bad, I’ve made so much effort to cut out any extra meal that I don’t need to eat to make my family think I’m still fine, and I eat less when I do eat too.

I’m glad I’m not the only one who doesn’t feel like telling their family. It’s not that I don’t want them to know or feel they won’t be understanding, it’s the opposite. I think they’ll be too understanding. My mother especially, as a former anorexic she’ll overreact and panic constantly until I’m better. And she’ll blame herself, plus there’s always the risk that it could make her relapse into her former-ED or depression.

If I tell anyone in my family, she’ll find out. And if I get a therapist, not that I have the resources, she’ll find out.

And I can’t easily tell a doctor... I don’t know how... I’ve never done that before, and I know my family would find out somehow and I can’t let them know because of how much they’ll worry. And they might make me eat... I want that to happen even less.

Even the popcorn thing is scary, 2 bites isn’t much but it’s all unnecessary calories. And I doubt I’ll be able to get away with just 2, my family will make me eat more, I know it. If I don’t ask for any, I can avoid eating the extra food. I’ll still have to buy an ice cream before the film, (It’s a family tradition since I was a child, and I can’t stop it or my mum will be even more suspicious that I have an ED than she already is...) but at least then I wouldn’t be eating any more calories in popcorn.

This is really hard for me.

I don’t know if you’re interested but I thought I’d tell you now today went... I woke up and decided that I’d leave breakfast up to chance, if my family cooked me some I’d eat it, otherwise I’d avoid eating anything. My family did cook for me, so I eat breakfast, but this meant that at the cinema I just couldn’t face eating any popcorn and was able to avoid eating anything.

That all went quite well but when we went home it got worse. We had a takeaway, which part of me knew would probably be what we had. So I ate it, naturally, because I don’t like wasting food, but after I finished I got a new feeling I’ve never had before when eating takeaways, especially the fish and chips we have today because I love it so much.

I felt so guilty. I felt sick with myself. I felt awful. I still do even. It’s insane. I don’t know why I feel like this and I’m scared now.

Dont keep any junk food in the house. None. Only healthy food. When you feel like youre losing control try meditating or distracting yourself with something else you enjoy that isnt harmful. Maybe a quick netflix sesh or a game or something.

I hate my appearance too, but for me it’s real, I’m not dysmorphic; just hideous and fat, so I for a while hated going outside or letting anyone see me.

I was always worried about people and what they thought of me, but no one ever has any interest in me and just ignores me. It’ll be the same for you, especially as you aren’t actually anywhere near as bad as you look.

Also, I wanted to say, congratulations on attempting recovery! A lot of people are too afraid to try and get better after even 8 years.

Keep up the recovery, I know you can do it!",Helpmycactusisdying,1577549053.0,2019-12-28 10:04:13,Although I don't have any advice I would just like to say... Keep going I believe in you!,the_scientist52,1577550036.0,2019-12-28 10:20:36,"If you want help with just the dysmorphia piece, you could always ask a trusted person to help you challenge the thoughts, since they're able to see you more accurately than you see yourself.  But honestly, I think that in recovery it's best to move away from focusing on your body/weight altogether.  For example, if your body really hasn't changed, you might think to yourself ""eating more intuitively for Christmas was okay because it didn't make me gain weight,"" which is still putting too much of a value on weight.  The true, non-disordered thought is ""eating more intuitively for Christmas was okay regardless of my weight, because I listened to my body's needs and ate foods that I enjoy.  My value is not determined by my weight and a change in either direction does not change my worth as a person.""  

I know these steps can be very difficult to take and maybe you aren't ready yet, but I think they're really important for a lasting recovery.  Just remember that you as a person haven't changed regardless of what your body size has done.  You still have the same good qualities that you did before December started, and your friends and family are going to have the same opinion of you that they did before.  And the efforts that you put in with weight restoration and a more recovery-focused Christmas are only going to make your life better and brighter, even if it's hard to muddle through these emotions right now.  You're setting yourself up for a much better future and the most important thing is to not let your disordered thoughts cause you to go backwards from the progress you've been making.  Use whatever coping skills it takes to not let the thoughts turn into behaviors and know that while body image issues tend to take the longest to heal, they can and will get better.",mutantandproud95,1577563887.0,2019-12-28 14:11:27,"I'm a 24 year old man with similar body image issues. I love Christmas and spend most the time eating cookies and candy, not working ANY of it off at the gym. I know reality and logic go out the window when it comes to how you see yourself and the guilt you feel for indulging. You need to know that your body hasn't changed at all though, and just like a few days of eating next to nothing doesn't make you thin no one got fat in a week.

My advice is to keep a big picture of your health and image. Picture yourself a month from now, back in healthy routine and realize this is just a blip in the whole scope of your nutrition and your appearance. 

I know it is hard, but please don't let feelings of guilt and disgust ruin your holiday. You indulged because on some level you enjoyed it, that doesn't change your value as a person or make you any more or less valid or beautiful. Every day is a chance to make better choices. Forgive yourself and please don't waste time beating yourself up about the past. You are perfectly fine, you are good enough, and you deserve to be just as happy as everyone else. It isn't easy, but you owe it to yourself to believe that",wintergirl13,1577577083.0,2019-12-28 17:51:23,"I am in the same boat with you.

I am absolutely humiliated when I see friends and family that I haven't seen since I was at my lowest weight, I'm convinced they're all thinking ""wow, she let herself go."" 

&amp;#x200B;

The only advice I can give you is this: it's the holidays, there's going to be more calorie consumption than normal, and less time to exercise, but it's nothing you can't come back from. I promise you will not gain an unreasonable amount of weight that you can't lose with a regular healthy diet and exercise routine if that's really what you feel you need to do. But don't let yourself obsess about it to the point that you revert back into unhealthy behavior. Just talk yourself through it, it's temporary and any change you see only you can see.

Intimacy can be tough for so many reasons for someone overcoming an eating disorder. I think this conversation is one to be had when you are not about to be intimate (no pressure) and are able to share how you feel in a way that doesn’t shame her reaction and doesn’t shame your body. She loves you and your body and is probably confused why you are ‘hiding’ from her.  I’m hoping that y’all have a relationship built on respect and love and that you can communicate that you feel most comfortable keeping yourself covered (for now, that it may change in the future) and she will honor that. 

I also have seen the advice to spend time looking in the mirror wearing your favorite outfit or if comfortable, nude, and practice finding attractive things and then speaking it out loud. It may sound completely ridiculous but it’s repeated advice because it works for some people. Another practice could be to touch your own body nicely. A lot of folks may have had the habit to pinch and prod their bodies and starting a routine of using nice smelling lotion on arms, stomach, and legs after getting out of the shower to start gentle touch on your own body. These might be triggers so definitely check in with yourself before trying.

Be patient with yourself and your body! Everyone is different and you will need to find what works for you.

Over time I justified not eating because I didn't have time or money to eat, but also because it was a really easy way to reduce calories and lose weight faster.

When I finally did start to make more money during college, I just kept on skipping meals and eating less. I was never happy with my body, no matter how much I lost. After college when I got my first professional job, the cycle just continued. I would still skip meals, reduce my calories, and kept dropping off weight.

The point is that I totally get it. Initially a lot of it seemed benign and easy to justify to myself, but it really quickly developed into really disordered eating. It took me a long time to realize it, and get the help of a professional. I highly recommend seeing a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. It's the first step, and if you invest in it, you're making a real investment in yourself and your health for the rest of your life. You can't go back and avoid it, but you have complete power to change where you go from here, as hard as it may be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Started to tell me to loss weight as an active 13 year old with a BMI of 21, developed an eating disorder, still won't admit he's wrong. Used to point out fat people in the street and tell me I'd end up looking like them, talk about my ""beer belly"" and (I'm a lesbian, fairly butch and didn't want to be at the time) talk disparagingly about how unattractive ""fat dykes"" were.

I lost my period as soon as I started losing weight and didn't have it for 3 years, severely decreasing my bone density. Got stress fractures, my periods are still dodgy, and issues with food that come and go. 

Cheers dad",Charlesjs25,1578585138.0,2020-01-09 09:52:18,"I'm sorry about your bad experience.  I'm a parent, so on the one hand I'm in total agreement and it sickens me when I hear about parents engaging in ED feuling behavior. But I can also tell you that parents are human, and having kids doesnt automatically mean they know what's best for them at any given time or what's in their head. So it's important to be open and honest with them so they can be mindful and (hopefully) helpful. your child's thought process is not always as obvious as you might think. If after you tell them what your going through they still aren't careful, well, that's a different story .",the_scientist52,1578599031.0,2020-01-09 13:43:51,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I get so upset when I hear things like ""you can't blame others for your eating disorder"" or when therapists tell parents, ""it isn't your fault your child developed an ED, don't blame yourself.""  

What if the parents did directly cause it?  What if they did things (promoted diet culture, commented on weight, were emotionally abusive in other ways, etc.) that were the underlying issues behind the ED?  I agree that after we know that something is wrong, recovering is something we have to take on for ourselves, and that in some situations the parents might not know any better.  For example, maybe their parents made light comments on body size so they just learned that it's an ""okay"" thing to do on occasion.  But there are some things that reach the level of truly being abusive--forcing diets, constant berating comments, name-calling, blaming you for their problems, etc. and there's no way someone could not know that they're doing something wrong.  And it's so invalidating when people act like you aren't allowed to resent the fact that if your parents hadn't acted maliciously, you'd likely be much better off.  

Anyway, sorry for the rant.  I know this isn't exactly what you mentioned in your post but parents fueling EDs does bother me too and I think it's important for those with EDs to recognize the reasons behind it so they can begin to heal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(155 lbs at 5' 3"" when I was around 100 lbs). 

Anyway, I know what it's like to have that hopeless feeling and to feel like super-anxious about simple food choices, like ""omgosh, I have lunch plans tomorrow, what am I going to order?"" and then trying to figure out what will be the lowest calorie option on the menu but once you get there, you're HUNGRY, and what's some bread going to hurt with your side salad? 

and what I've taken away from all this myself is that I'm not any less beautiful because I've put on weight, and I shouldn't focus so much on the number on the scale. instead, I should focus on BEING HEALTHY. drinking lots of water, eating fruits and veg, grabbing healthy foods when I feel snacky, exercising, and doing things that make me happy.

I'm a recent college graduate and disabled, having trouble finding a job that doesn't cause me tons of pain so I'm still struggling financially like I did in college. My disordered eating comes from being starved by my mom in childhood even though I grew up ostensibly well off, and my current state of poverty is really not helping. I feel like the trauma is compounding instead of getting better because I never learned how to eat normally in the first place, and now I can't afford to even though I really want to recover. I had a period of time where I had a really well paying job right out of college but I was still unable to eat normally, I was making $60k a year (for a month lol) and I still couldn't eat the appropriate amount of calories. Sounds like I went the opposite way and couldn't break the habit of starving myself. Unfortunately I had to quit that job for a number of reasons. That up and down really sucks and I wish I had help recovering.

I'd suggest finding a therapist that SPECIALIZES in eating disorders. It's very important that they specialize in it because if they don't they can screw your situation up even more. I'd also try to get a dietitian that also specializes and have them make her a meal plan. The Skyping and eating with her is a good plan and can be helpful for some people. The biggest thing you can do to help is to avoid making comments that would trigger her. Sit her down and have a talk with her about boundaries and what things trigger her. But it's also important to know that ultimately recovery is up to her. If she doesn't want to recover she won't. Most people don't want to recover until they hit rock bottom. At least that's what happened for me, my sister, and all my friends I met when I went to an eating disorder rehab center. I hope that at least some of this has helped. Also I want to say that it's refreshing to see someone care enough to reach out and ask for assistance in supporting their partner.

First, it doesn’t sound like the medications you are on are helping. I’m kind of surprised you were put on Vyvanse for binge/purge symptoms. As it is an appetite suppressant, and you were a healthy weight at the time.
You said your bf was low when this started. Sometimes low bf, even at a healthy weight can cause your body to crave food as if it were malnourished. Perhaps that is part of what triggered the b/p. 
Either way, and I know your anxiety and dysmorphia regarding your body right now will fight this, but I think coming off the medications and getting a healthy meal plan in place with the help of a dietitian could be a good place to start. 
As you’re already waiting to hear about rehab/IOP, I would say to just bear these things in mind and be honest with those assessing your needs. 
I really hope things get better for you soon, I know how horrible the b/p trap is to be in. But you weren’t always suffering like this, and there is definitely a way back to health.

Medicine doesn’t often help EDs. Try changing your thoughts. If your job was a trigger, pinpoint what thoughts you had at your job that could foster eating behavior. Figure out what thoughts stuck with you and became your core beliefs. Look that up online. Learn to handle stress in healthier ways. I had a job that triggered binges at work.

Each time I felt horrible about it and like my professors/advisor would be judging me. I also judged myself because academics have always been my thing and the thought of being ""behind"" everyone else was almost impossible to tolerate.  I was also worried about losing out on friendships, especially because I was really shy and struggled in that area anyway.

Taking that time off ended up being a WONDERFUL decision.  I did graduate a year late, because I went to a small school with few course offerings and it wasn't possible to fit in my required classes any other way.  But, getting a year behind meant that I spent the last 2.5 years of my college career on track with the class behind me, and it turned out that I liked those people a lot better!  After being in a few classes with them we grew closer and I felt completely comfortable.  I also ended up with great relationships with professors and my advisor, I got an awesome campus job, I was a tutor, I had a high GPA, and I got into a prestigious graduate program.  And all of those things happened because I took the time off when I needed to and was able to go back stronger!  It was hard to watch other people my age graduate a year before me, or to think about how things could've been different had I not taken time off.  But it turned out that things worked out so much better than if I had stayed in school when my physical and emotional health weren't where they needed to be.

I thought I should have been able to manage it all, I believed I could live a life where I was ill but able to maintain my social life and grades. The truth is, taking some time off school and recovering is the best choice I could’ve made for myself.

I was supposed to start college despite spending my last year in hs in treatment. When I couldn’t go because I was in treatment again I was devastated. I just wanted to be normal. The reality is that if your ED is still in the picture, you will never be able to live the life you want. Take that semester of and work your ass off to kick your disorder’s butt. Yes, you are going to miss out on some things and it’s going to suck but it’s only a small portion of your life.  New opportunities will arise and some will even be better. However, if you don’t address the issue now you’ll miss so much more. You might be there in the moment but you won’t mentally be there.

That was a long intro to say that the more I isolate myself the worse I am and although I will refuse to see anyone 9 times out of 10, the times I accept, I do feel  bit better/more normal/less controlled by my thoughts... not sure if this is hepful at all but thanks for reading!!!",the_scientist52,1578245742.0,2020-01-05 11:35:42,"You're definitely right that any comment about appearance would likely be triggering and could feed the ED.  For some people, expressing concern at all (whether it's appearance or health) ends up being triggering because it validates that the person is ""sick.""  Those people use their ED to express how they're feeling inside, so looking unwell on the outside to match how they're feeling is the goal.  There's also the competitive side to EDs where people want to be the ""best"" anorexic and get excited when they seem to be achieving that goal.  That's not to say your sister feels that way, or that feeling that way is bad (I've struggled with aspects of it and know many others who have)--it's just something to keep in mind.  

Recovery can take a long time, so I think it's important for you and your family to not give up hope that she can eventually get out of this.  That said, a person has to want recovery for themselves in order for it to work and if she doesn't right now, there sadly isn't much you can do.  You can continue to encourage her but I think it's important for you to be mindful of your own mental health too, and maybe it's time for you to take a step back.  That might sound bad but it isn't the same as giving up.  It doesn't mean you don't care.  It's just a way for you to stop taking on so much responsibility for her recovery and feeling bad when your well-intentioned efforts don't lead to change.  You can tell her that you still want to support her, and that if at any point she decides that she wants help, you'll be right there with her.  But that leaves it up to her to make that decision for herself.

I'd also recommend maybe looking into therapy for yourself too, even if it's just a few sessions.  I can imagine that being a family member of an ED sufferer is exceptionally difficult and it obviously takes a toll on you.

I agree with some other commenters who have mentioned avoiding bringing up physical appearance. Weight truly is just a symptom of an eating disorder — however, of course extremely low weights are dangerous health wise. But I’d focus on health if you can; rather than “you are looking so thin,” something along the lines of “I’m really worried that this is going to have lasting damaging effects on your body.”

Beyond all that though, I agree with another commenter that truly someone cannot genuinely recover until they want it for themselves. HOWEVER it does get to a point where physical recovery becomes more important than mental recovery in the immediate due to physical health concerns. 

Most of all I want to emphasize that huge components of eating disorders are isolation and guilt. So I would encourage you to continue to show your support the way it sounds like you already are, and try to make sure your concern doesn’t come across as a guilt trip accidentally. Things like “what you’re doing to yourself is making me sick with worry” assigns blame versus “I’m so worried about you because I love you and I hate seeing you like this.”

With eating disorders, it may seem like if you just lose x pounds everything will be perfectly fine, but the goal always ends up changing and you're never satisfied.  And even if by some miracle you could be satisfied at a lower weight, you don't want your happiness and confidence to be based off of something you have to hurt yourself to get.  That isn't sustainable and it won't lead to a fulfilling life for you.

Feeling okay about your body is the harder choice, like you said.  It takes a long time and it can often be months or years after a person is stable behaviorally before they're able to just accept their body.  Body image is usually the last thing to heal when recovering from an eating disorder.  But, it does heal.  It might seem like accepting yourself is impossible, but that's just because you aren't there yet.  It doesn't mean that you won't ever reach that point.  

Using behaviors for any reason is never a good choice and will only lead to disastrous consequences.  Use your time in college to build an identity outside of what you look like.

I need to be able to work through the underlying reasons for my ED (trauma, etc.) in order to keep myself from falling into old behavior patterns.  Accountability also works super well for me, so I set specific goals with my treatment team and can then check in with them about how the goals are going.

Outside of that, maybe set specific goals with yourself to help you stay on track with food/exercise.  Plan meals in advance and then when it's time to eat, just do it methodically.  Make a list of reasons you need/want to stay in recovery, or good things that being in recovery has given you.  Avoid triggers as much as you can.  Stop weighing yourself if that's something you struggle with.  Don't go clothes shopping for a while.  When you find yourself with disordered thoughts or are considering using a behavior, distract yourself immediately so that the thought can't implant itself as deeply into your mind.  Try to give more of your attention to the logical thoughts than to the disordered ones.",savethebees1989,1578253874.0,2020-01-05 13:51:14,"wonderful advice, thank you ❤️",lluly,1578436823.0,2020-01-07 16:40:23,"Same situation, but I've relapsed since my recovery.

I was diagnosed with super ventricular tachycardia when I was at my worst with my ED. They had told me this was a condition I was born with, but could be worsened by external factors. My cardiologist didn’t know details of my ED so he never made that connection but they did tell me that symptoms may improve with better food choices, more sleep, just basically taking care of myself. 

I was in college at the time and VERY stressed from life (which triggered the worst of my ED). I didn’t have anything close to a normal or healthy diet, and I barely slept ever. Once I started to recover from my ED with the help of a dietitian my heart issues became so much better as well. 

I still have occasional episodes and it’s likely to become worse if I ever am pregnant, but I’ve found having a consistent sleep schedule, and healthy (as in actually eating enough and not doing any ED behaviors) eating habits, I really don’t have major heart issues. 

I would encourage you to work on your ED symptoms with a professional and see if that helps with the tachycardia. If that means being monitored in a hospital setting, inpatient treatment, etc.. I think you should advocate for what you need.",Thin_Wishes3,1578169610.0,2020-01-04 14:26:50,"I have tachycardia, my resting HR is about the exact same as yours. I haven’t read anything about it being related to ED and sudden cardiac death, although that makes a ton of sense. I also haven’t really even googled it. I was diagnosed w tachycardia about 3.5 years ago, me not ever caring about my health, I didn’t do any of the recommended follow ups.

While I’m in recovery right now, I’m still using a ton of ED symptoms so I haven’t noticed any improvement at all although I would imagine it would improve with actual recovery. I’m a big purger so I’ve always figured it was probably related to that. It also stresses me out because I get palpitations and chest pains that get worse when I purge a lot. My dieitcan also did tell me about an old clients friend who had a heart attack while purging and died.. she was 25. So not saying that to scare you, but more so about ignorance of people not thinking you should be in more of a supervised recovery. 

My suggestion would be to not push yourself with exercise, mine can hit about 200 while working out, try and make healthy food choices the best to your ability and stay away from dehydrating factors (purging, lax, etc) as dehydration can make your heart work harder.

My dr explained that low heart rate in anorexia is pretty typical. But tachycardia + extreme low weight is unusual and usually runs a higher risk of heart attack (he had an explanation that was too technical for me to understand). 2 months inpatient on the tube + 1 month residential brought my heart rate back down to a normal range so it IS REVERSIBLE.

Now I understand that a lot of people are walking around with heartrates 100+bpm since 100 is the upper range and many other non-ED conditions cause this too but I’m sure your HR was not always at 100+ so the issue here is that increase in HR (that itself is already abnormal) AND the fact that it is high enough to be considered tachycardia (and surely uncomfortable) and should be investigated/treated.

As for your last question, you're right--residential isn't going to completely fix your eating disorder.  The idea is that intensive treatment kickstarts your recovery enough so that afterwards, you can successfully continue making progress on your own.  You won't leave cured, or even close to it, but you'll leave in a physically healthier place, with weeks of behavioral stability under your belt, and with better ways to cope with the parts of life that you're using the ED to cope with right now.

I also think it's important for you to stop calling yourself fat and making jokes about your body.  That can take a lot of hard work, because there's probably a part of you that wants people to respond with ""oh no you're not"" when you call yourself fat.  That's common even in people without EDs and is definitely a thing for ED sufferers.  The ED wants validation.  If we didn't on some level want a response from someone, we wouldn't make those comments in front of others.  And if you make a derogatory comment about yourself, people who care about you are of course going to counter it.  So the way to make that stop is to just stop saying those things.

I was the exact same 4 months ago: never full, constantly hungry despite eating lots, worried I'd never stop thinking about food. Being ultra-focused on food is a symptom of malnutrition; your body is trying to let you know what it wants. I was terrified of the whole process but I tried to trust others (e.g. Tabitha Farrar, Abbey's Kitchen) that I needed to see the whole thing through. So I didn't restrict, and just let my body lead the way.

At first I had binges, though I don't really see them as 'binges' now. I was just incredibly hungry and I'd been confusing my body with restriction for years and moralising food in my head. It's taking a lot of rewiring my brain to start to sift out all the automatic counting and calculating that my brain does automatically. It was a very conscious effort in the beginning but it's paying off now.

I got my period back last month. Around the same time, I noticed a lot of changes: my hair stopped falling out, my nails looked healthy and my brain started to chill out about food. I still have bad days but now, more often than not, I can eat a meal and move on. I forget what I've eaten sometimes, don't obsessively plan what to eat, don't feel the need to stockpile food. I used to fidget at the table, internally begging that someone would suggest dessert because I felt starving but was afraid of looking greedy. Now I have dessert when I feel like it. Over the holidays, I enjoyed chocolate every day but now I'm kind of bored of it. That seemed impossible to me 4 months ago. I spent months of recovery thinking I'd never be able to think normally.

So hold in there. I recommend getting some support because I got so unbelievably sensitive when my hormones started stirring again (Puberty 2.0) and sometimes you just need to someone to vent to.

I’M SO HUNGRY ALL THE TIME. I eat 2-3 meals depending on how I feel but I’m always hungry and I end up eating loads of small stuff like plates of cheese and biscuits, which leaves me feeling full, yet I’m still starving hungry. And then I start feeling sick with guilt about how much I’ve eaten.

I feel awful about this, like I’m gaining back all the weight I carefully lost, and my body looks like it’s doubled in size, as if I’ve gained that much fat back. Except, I don’t think it has, since I can still feel my ribs almost pressing on the surface even though it looks like I’ve got 6 centimetres of fat between them and my skin.

The hardest part is that I feel like I’m ruining everything by doing this and it’s giving me constant desires to restrict even further and eat even less. It feels like if I keep going this way I won’t be able to stop eating ever and I’ll keep being fat. I think the only thing keeping me in recovery is the fact that I know that in 2 years I’ll live alone and can lose as much weight as I want without my family finding out.

I’m sorry you have to go through this too. Luckily I know from experience that this extreme hunger and with it the binges will end after a while, as I had it a couple of months ago when I tried to make myself eat again after my dietary restrictions got extreme enough to make me worry.

1402,eo46af,blitzkriegzo84,1578937561.0,2020-01-13 11:46:01,It is natural. Just keep eating and filling your body with nutrients and over the course of a couple weeks or so your body will straighten everything out,h123m00,1578941085.0,2020-01-13 12:44:45,"You may have been eating more than you thought. Remember, your body can’t deny physics. Also, it’s possible that you don’t need as much calories as some people. I’ve had my metabolism measured at the hospital (lol during a lab tour at children’s hospital I volunteered to do it and it was so cool) and if I were to lay in bed all all and do nothing, I would need only about 1400 calories which seems low, I mean I’m 5’7, but apparently it’s average. With my current level of exercise / daily activity I need about 2000-2100. So it could also be your exercise level. 

That being said, try to not focus on calories and just stop eating when your full. Eat slowly, and if your hungry and hour later you know you didn’t eat enough at your last meal. You won’t gain weight if you eat what your body needs",theilliteratecrow,1578967046.0,2020-01-13 19:57:26,"I would recommend talking to a dietitian (if your insurance allows it). It can be hard to start the path of recovery without any guidance. Like others have said, sometimes you don’t need as much as others, but as you’re still growing, it can be impossible to tell sometimes. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that your hunger/fullness awareness is probably all out of sorts. When I first started refeeding, I would feel full within bites. If you have been restricting for years, your stomach and your brain are probably still lacking the communication needed to actually determine wether you have consumed enough. 

For me personally, I found it really helpful to be on a strict scheduled. I always felt full but I knew (because of my professional team) that I needed more food. I have a super high metabolism so I would have 3 meals with “2 add-ons” and 3 “AA snacks” a day. This meant I was eating much more (almost double) what the other girls in my treatment center were eating. When I graduated from treatment, I continued with that schedule religiously because, even though I had “graduated”, my body still hadn’t completely recovered. This meant I could go all day without eating because I just wouldn’t feel hungry. 

In regards to the “excess weight”, one of the hardest parts about recovery is learning to accept your body regardless of the size or shape. Since you’re so young, your body is going to be changing a LOT. Also, if you started restricting around the age of 12, you probably lacked the nutrients to develop properly during puberty and your body might be trying to catch up on that lost time. There are so many factors that go into your physical development, but you have to keep reminding yourself that those changes are not only good, but necessary. 

If your insurance covers therapy, I would highly recommend finding a therapist that specializes in eating disorders. Even if you think you don’t need therapy, it can be SO helpful. I know that it can feel difficult because with OSFED you can feel like you “don’t have the same issues” as girls with other more common disorders. But I can promise you, there is a lot more in common than you think. I was convinced that I would get nothing out of treatment because I “wasn’t like the other girls there”,  but that was the farthest thing from true.  

It is incredible that you are choosing recovery so early and I want to encourage you to welcome the changes and the challenges, no matter how painful it may be. Don’t let your ED take over your life. Your ED voice may feel so strong sometimes, but I promise that you are stronger. I promise that it will be worth it. And I promise that regardless of the struggles, Recovery will be worth it. Recovery is never linear. 

You can do the hard things.",theannoyingarmy,1578986613.0,2020-01-14 01:23:33,I can 100% relate to you. Right now I am trying to recover by slowly upping my calorie intake.

1408,enm79r,sunflowersadly,1578840532.0,2020-01-12 08:48:52,"Unfortunately it definitely sounds like eating disorder thinking if you’re just planning ahead in order to restrict more in the future.  That doesn’t sound like a healthy mindset I’m afraid.  But if you’re eating well and feeling good at the moment that is the PERFECT time to try and recover fully.  Your brain is getting all the nutrients and energy it needs to function properly if you aren’t restricting, and if you’re happy and feeling more positive about life in general, you have a real reason to recover so you can keep enjoying your life with your bf etc.  So get some therapy, meditate, eat nutritious foods and try to recover while you’re on the upswing!",SecretIdentity8594,1578886001.0,2020-01-12 21:26:41,"I think you’re right. I wrote my post in the middle of a something which to me felt like a manic episode (like with Bipolar) and had all the symptoms but almost certainly wasn’t one. I eventually came out of it and regretted making my post immediately... but you can’t delete PMs.

I’ve been eating normally recently so I’ve been getting a lot of thoughts telling me I’m fine, and I’m better now since I’m eating properly: *”Someone with an eating disorder wouldn’t eat like this, I’m fine.”*, *”I’m not thin; I can’t have an ED.”* and *”I’m eating now so that means I’m better.”*, to explain a few...

During the episode the other day... (if it even was an episode I’m sure it’s nothing really) I made a lot of decisions and one of them was to listen to these thoughts and now it feels like not only do I not have an ED, I’ve never had an ED at all. I’ve had this happen before but I just want to accept that maybe I’m right this time since it would be so much less stressful for me.

Part of me wants to agree with you and keep getting better... but I just want to be happy... and the easiest way to achieve that is just to let myself believe that I’m fine and there was never anything wrong with me. Then I can just keep eating like this for 2 more years, and then I can start dieting again without having to worry about my family finding out, and finally be happy with my body.

I wish I’d never stopped restricting like this... I don’t know why I stopped and I hate myself for it. I think it’s because I’m back to school now and need to find new methods to skip meals. If I’d just kept dieting and being happy then I wouldn’t have to wait too years. When I wasn’t eating I didn’t worry about my family finding out... now I can’t stop and that’s making it so hard to skip meals because if they see me missing just one they'll find out about everything and then I won’t get those university years to myself where I can finally be truly happy.",sunflowersadly,1578928447.0,2020-01-13 09:14:07,"I’m sorry but you are definitely still in the midst of Eating Disorder thinking and you really really should get some professional help when you feel able to... I totally understand how you feel about “finally being happy” when you can restrict how you want and get as thin as you want, but believe me that’s an illusion.  Whilst you have an eating disorder you can NEVER be happy with your body.... it’s part of its curse.  It doesn’t matter how thin you get, or how little you eat, it will never be enough and you will never be truly happy.

If you really want to be happy you’ll have to struggle through the tough times recovery brings, but after that you can genuinely genuinely be happy AND healthy... it is possible.  Being happy AND having an eating disorder is not. 

I hope things turn out well for you xx",SecretIdentity8594,1579070595.0,2020-01-15 00:43:15,"I can’t get any professional help because I live with my family but I don’t think I need it. You’re right that with an ED I wouldn’t ever be able to be happy with my body. That means I don’t have one which I honestly so relieving. All I have to do is get down to 140lbs and I should be happy. Maybe 120lbs. But I have a goal weight and I’ll be happy when I reach it so I’m definitely better now.

I’m happy and healthy already, which is just even more proof I don’t have an ED. I haven’t been this healthy since I was little and eating more will just make me fatter. Thanks for hoping things turn out well for me. Things should now that I understand there’s nothing wrong with me.",Margkam,1579199938.0,2020-01-16 12:38:58,"Holy cow that’s passive aggressive. This entire reply comes off as very sarcastic, so I’m not sure how to approach. 

The thinking that you will feel happy with yourself at a certain weight is disordered and illusionary, the disorder will never allow you that satisfaction and will only intensify its grips as you lose more. You may physically be healthy at this point, but your thinking sounds sick. 

Once stressors of university hit, it becomes very difficult to manage. Before leaving, since you know that this is a problem it is wise to address it. In university you will have invested money into studies and can’t afford to sink into an eating disorder. I hope that you’ll consider some options now to set yourself up for the best chance at success later. The longer you have an eating disorder the more difficult it is to treat — not impossible though!",SecretIdentity8594,1579208590.0,2020-01-16 15:03:10,"I’m not trying to be passive aggressive or sarcastic. Or at least... part of me isn’t. It’s complicated. It’s hard to explain too. Part of me feels like if I write like this eventually I'll make people hate me enough to get banned and then I won’t be able keep posting here, which it also considers a good thing. Another part of me just wants to tell the truth. And the rest of me is just too scared to accept that truth.

You’ve said loads of good advice but honestly I don’t know what to do with it. I don’t even have a problem; I’m fine. I made my original post during a manic episode so I wasn’t thinking straight. But I’m thinking much straighter now and I’ve realised I was wrong to worry and I should just accept that I don’t have an ED as it’s easier and makes me happier.

I can’t wait until university where I’ll be on my own but I doubt my dream will ever happen now as I’ve just failed all my A-Levels so I’m unlikely to ever get a chance. So there’s nothing to worry about as I won’t end up wasting any money on studies I can’t complete.",Margkam,1579220087.0,2020-01-16 18:14:47,"You’re referring to it, “which IT also considers a good thing,” meaning that you are aware of the fact that there is something going on. I think you show some good insight in recognizing that you both want to sabotage opportunities for help but are seeking them. It sounds to me like you aren’t fine, and you know the “truth” better than anyone and that truth sounds like there is a pattern of disordered thinking around food and body — I cannot diagnose you, but in my mind that more than constitutes the need for attention to that issue. 

I’m sorry you’ve failed some tests, perhaps what you’re dealing with may have contributed to that outcome. The dream isn’t dead or gone, university is not unobtainable, but it may be an indicator that you need to take care of yourself to be able to get where you want to be. It can be a true strength to ask for help and follow through on it rather than stuffing it down until you break. I wish you the best.",SecretIdentity8594,1579253334.0,2020-01-17 03:28:54,"By “it” I mean that just that part of me believes that getting kicked off here would help. The rest of me doesn’t want to since I like helping people in this subreddit. I don’t know why I made a post seeking help, I was manic and not thinking straight. I lose all inhibitions and I do stupid stuff that I regret. I can’t delete the post as I didn’t post it technically, I just sent a PM. I only sabotaged it since I don’t need help. I’m sorry you don’t think I’m fine but I’m pretty certain I am now.

I thought it might’ve at first, I failed the original tests after not eating for 36 hours so I thought that might’ve contributed but then I failed these retakes too, proving that I’m just bad at maths and physics rather than it being anything that I’d done. The dream might not be dead if I can just keep passing my geography exams but I’m not even that good at that. I don’t know how I keep getting As in them as I shouldn’t be getting grades that high. I really hope I still get to go to university. Or at least find another excuse to live alone for years.

I don’t need help with anything. If I had a problem I’d agree that you’re stronger for finding help but I don’t have one. Thanks for the well-wishes though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nor should she be relying solely on you for support, you are not a trained professional and you don't know how to help her or how to keep yourself healthy while helping her. 

If you can - look into eating disorder support groups that you can go to together. That way you're supporting each other while learning what is healthy support vs unhealthy. And that gives you the option of telling her or not, you could go as someone with a disorder or as her support person. Your disorder is your personal business and you should only tell her if you want to.

If not, I would at the very least use the rules of this subreddit to redefine your relationship with her - no positive ED talk, no specific numbers, and (a rule I personally like) no specific symptom talk. It's not good for your or her to be fantasizing about the disorder, discussing numbers, or using specific symptoms. Getting used to saying ""I acted on symptoms today"" rather than ""I did x, y, and z"" can really help get you both into the mindset of recovery.

I well understand your situation. From my experience I think that the very best help you can offer is sending her a copy of this post. How to help each other is a conversation good friends need to have. Is she a good friend or a casual one or acquaintance? True friendship is based on authenticity and sharing what's in your mind and heart. You can't can't be supportive of a friend, in my opinion, without sharing your truths. I'm assuming that you are seeing a therapist or counselor. If so, you need to speak about this with that person.  You sound very young, so I hope advice from someone who isn't &lt;G&gt; may be of some value to you. :)

The good news is you're not at all alone and where you are now is not unusual. When I started therapy I also was without health insurance. I was able to see a therapist once a month at first.  It wasn't easy or fun paying cash because it is what I would consider expensive, but one therapist appointment is probably the same cost as a few meals and I made it a priority. Often times therapists offer a sliding scale for cash patients as well. Having said that, there are many additional free or low cost services available that you may find extremely helpful. 

You want to find a Certified Eating Disorder Specialist. I know there is a directory online and I have included another resource.
https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline This website has lots of info, too. 

Addressing eating disorders isn't as much about the eating as it is addressing how you got to that point. It is very important to have a professional counselor involved in your recovery. Just sitting down and getting some names or therapists, calling and asking about sliding scales/$, is exhausting, but it is a positive part of your recovery!

Now? My mom is on an antidepressant and we talk about how her extreme ""diets"" and poor body image when I was growing up probably fell into the category of anorexia.

I used to work in an ED clinic, and we had plenty of moms with adult children. Some were adamant that their children weren't informed whatsoever, even if the kids has suspicions. Others were more willing, and even did family therapy with their kids, with the kids acting as the support. 

If you're getting no where with your mom, try another close family member or friend. Maybe try having the discussion with your dad (you could almost practice what you would want to say). Sometimes it's the family that almost force treatment to happen, intervention style, because the parent is too stuck in the ED to ever see a way out. Be consistent. Be patient with her.

I think the best advice for what to do will probably come from her, but I can try to give you some insights into what my boyfriend did that helped me!

Just for some quick background I’m recovering from anorexia, which means I have to eat a lot more food than normal in order to gain weight. Sometimes for me I end up making myself sick because I get overwhelmed. Triggers are very different for each person, but for me going out to eat was very hard. At dinners out my boyfriend generally gets suspicious if I leave the table for five or more minutes, or come back with a post vomit look. You can generally tell if someone has just thrown up by the way they look (puffy cheeks, sweaty or a little teary, red face, and they might repeatedly wipe their face). If she’s going to the bathroom in the middle of meals or directly after that can be a warning sign. If you’re at home and you hear retching noises (some people will try to hide them by turning on the sink or shower), that’s obviously a sign as well. 

In general, you should avoid comments on how much she’s eating or her physical appearance in terms of size. It does sound like your partner hasn’t been doing it recently (?) so if that’s the case I wouldn’t worry about it too much, and just make sure they know that you’re there for them if they need you and that they can tell you if they are currently engaging in purging.",Loganium,1579807710.0,2020-01-23 13:28:30,"Thanks for your comment, it's really helpful, she told me that she did it once or twice recently but shes doing everything she can to avoid doing it again.

I find it disappointing that mental health issues are seen this way in our society, but maybe you can agree with me that this should change. There’s no reason why eating disorders should be shameful or stigmatized, and reversing that stigma starts with the individuals who are affected.

Your life is very clearly being negatively impacted by anorexia, but I’ve struggled with the same issues of acceptance that you have and I know what it’s like to be in disbelief at a diagnosis. I never starved myself completely, or went days without eating the way I thought “real” anorexics did. However your body needs a lot of calories. For me (a 5’3 teenage girl), my daily caloric needs are like 2500, but for you they’d probably be close to 3000. This means that eating around 1000-1500 can be considered severe undereating for you, which is equivalent to starving yourself in terms of health risks. You said that you’re underweight, you’re eating a low amount, and you’re scared to eat more, and these are very clear diagnostic criteria for anorexia, so I think your doctor is right. 

I urge you to reverse your thinking and accept the diagnosis and suggestions your doctor has given you. It might be helpful for you to find a nutritionist you could meet with who has experience with eating disorders. They can help you develop a meal plan that will prevent the developing of binge eating while returning you to normal eating habits. Reaching out can be scary, but the end result is so worth it.

Male anorexia is even less understood than female.  You might be surprised to learn that the mechanisms at play can be so much more complicated than the cliche  of “fear of being fat”.

&gt;i take appetite suppressants

and then 

&gt;worried about hair loss and feeling tired and dizzy all the time

Yes, it sounds very much like anorexia.

Don't be afraid to add a little bit more food to your diet, I don't know your current weight/caloric intake, and I'm not a doctor, so I won't recommend any numbers, but from your description - you need it.

First of all, extra bit of calories (of course, not unlimited amount) won't make you obese again. Probably, you will just reach healthy weight, your situation with dizziness and tiredness will improve a bit, your hair will start growing back.

Second, if you want to be muscular, you need to workout and eat at a surplus, otherwise you'll see little to no progress.

I understand your concern about the symptoms, and I know that sometimes doctors tend to blame all the problems on the weight of the patient, but you do have an issue. Even if your symptoms are not related to your weight (which I doubt), it's better to not make it worse by ignoring it.

Try to gradually improve your diet and ditch appetite suppressants and then see if your conditions will improve.

&gt;I don't want that stigma attached to me

You don't need to tell that you are/were anorexic (besides the doctors, of course). No one should stick their noses into your life without your approval. No one should blame you for your illness. Would you blame someone with a cold?

Try to reach psychologist/psychiatrist with your concerns. Don't be afraid of the stigma. I know, I was, and I regret it now because I could feel so much better and not be miserable for so long.

I really truly think you should let your therapist know about everything that’s happened and been going on.

I first realized that I had an issue a few months into 9th grade. I actively avoided eating whenever possible, and lost weight fairly rapidly. A few months later, I was noticeably thinner. Having started underweight, I dipped into a zone that would be seriously dangerous if I was much older.

I spent a winter in a constantly cycling between biting cold and a deep, shivering numbness. I slept far too much. I made choices that wasted hours of my time, including actively pushing myself to reach insane step counts - 20,000 steps was my weekday minimum. One night, my heart rate slipped to 37 BPM.

I gradually crept back upwards over the following half year, regaining about half of the weight. Every night I cried myself to sleep. I was worried about osteoporosis, heart failure, suicide. I toyed with the idea of asking for help, but always chickened out. It was my light at the end of the tunnel, something I could aspire to. They could fix me.

In the meantime, I wrote melodramatic poetry, and made many drafts of my will.

One night, I actually did it. I emailed my brother. After a long and tense exchange, I sent him my masterpiece - a conglomeration of the pest poems. I also sent my list of grievances, including, of course, my ed.

He asked me two things. I wasn't really going to kill myself, right? And what did I mean about the snippet about him, and how I felt bad for not listening to him?

Then he shunted me off to Mom.

Therein lay the most surreal experience of my life.

She had me wait in the guest bedroom for fifteen minutes while she reviewed the relevant documents. (I left my computer with her for easy viewing.) I shivered, terrified, in the dimly lit room. My life was about to change.

We began a bizarre discussion. She quickly dismissed my ed concerns - she'd flirted with one herself when she was my age. We focused more on my problems with socialization, spending half an hour on her childhood woes. It quickly shifted to a rant - she claimed to be over it, and fine now. She clearly wasn't. The session ended with a bold declaration - this was going to be the year of (me)!

That lasted a solid twenty four hours. Nobody ever even told Dad. We haven't mentioned eds since.

For the rest of the summer, I was diplomatically forced to drink smoothies and finish my plate. I checked off the ""eating disorder concerns"" box at the doctor - she erased the mark. My brother and I went in for some mental health thing. She said she'd come in and we could talk about my ed concerns. We didn't.

One month later, my brother and I had a pathetic fight over who got to shower first. He taunted me, ""Keep eating that pudding! Aren't you worried about being stupid and fat? Doesn't it make you feel sick?"". I haven't told him anything personal since.

He thinks we're pals.

We aren't.

Through brute force and incessant whining, I convinced Mom to let me see a therapist. In the house, we refer to her as a general ""appointment"". I haven't told the therapist about any of this. She thinks my biggest concerns are socialization and accepting my brother. I've never alluded to depression, eds, or self-harm, even when specifically asked.

I'm a pretty good liar.

I told myself I'd build some trust and then we could broach the subject, but I'm in too deep now. I'm far too scared. I can't have this happen again. And she remains my new light, dimmer, flickering, and likely a mirage.

I weigh fifteen pounds more than when I started. I constantly stuff my face with sugar - a massive percentage of my diet relies upon it. I casually try to stay under my calorie limits, but overeat anyway.

I don't feel comfortable claiming the title of an ed. I clearly don't have the willpower.

Sorry for the rant. I just needed to get it out of my system.

Any advice would be welcomed. Or, honestly, just an acknowledgement that someone at least heard my ramblings.

If you aren't gonna tell him/her the truth you might as well stop seeing them because you won't see the results you want.

Don't let your family dictate your problems. You seem to have an ED, reading your story, and your mom acknowledging or not doesn't change that fact at all. 

Don't be what your mom tells or wants you to be, seek help for yourself and use the therapist like it should be used: to tackle your real problems and that starts by opening up. These things don't dissapear themselves, it's (hard) work but you get there once you are willing to take that next step.",4estof4,1580198177.0,2020-01-28 01:56:17,"This is beautiful.

Keep your eye on the prize (recovery) because from my experience and what I have see in others, your weight distributes awkwardly in the beginning then evens out. Most people especially gain weight in their stomach (don’t be scared off just yet and keep reading lol). 

 I will look back to pictures from when I first recovered to now, and at first I had a belly but now my stomach is totally flat even though I am still the same weight. After some time my weight went from my stomach to my hips and everything got “tighter”. Whenever you fast you are losing a lot of muscle too which is what leads to the awkward weight in the beginning. 

If you are really worried about the weight distribution, lifting weights really helped me in recovery. I had to start off super light of course (usually just the bar) but slowly got stronger. It’s been over a year since I was lifting regularly because life got in the way, but my stomach has stayed flat. I would highly recommend lifting because it honestly saved my life (I no longer felt bad about eating when I knew it was fueling my muscles instead of fat). But I also know people who did not lift and their weight still ended up distributing nicely. If you treat your body right, it will treat you right back.

i would suggest taking her to a therapist but before she goes book an appointment talk to them about her, let them know whats happening how shes ''overweight'' and shes uncomfortable with it, but she had ED and you want to make sure that her ED gets better, but you also want to make sure she can learn to lose weight a much healthier way then just purging or starving, 

you may need to inform her (nicely) that she will have to work on her ED and get better from that before she can lose weight, that will be a tricky topic trust me but you need to remember to stay strong, don't get mad, be nice, and try your hardest to understand how shes feeling.

i would also recommend doing some research on this topic so you can familiarize yourself with other people story's (can find on YouTube), or whats actually going on inside her head, that sort of stuff before this conversation,

you are never gonna fully understand unless you have been through this, i have figured that out throughout my life, the most you can do is be supportive, don't get mad, try to do research about this topic, and try to understand as much as you can what shes trying to deal with.

Whether the behaviors are restricting, bingeing, purging, etc and regardless of whether the person is underweight, normal weight, or overweight.  It’s necessary for the body to get back in balance with proper nutrition and without harmful behaviors.  The mental aspect needs to be healed as well or else the person will likely turn back to behaviors.  This is especially relevant for your girlfriend’s case because if she doesn’t heal her mindset, future attempts to lose weight probably won’t be done in a healthy way.  

After a significant amount of mental and physical recovery is done, closely-monitored weight loss is a possibility.  Your girlfriend would need to work with a dietitian who could help her fuel her body properly while still losing weight.  Adjustment of weight loss goals might also occur once her mindset is healed.  For example, maybe she will decide to lose weight for true health reasons, but the amount she wants to lose is less because she isn’t being influenced by the eating disorder.

It really is a tricky situation and I can imagine that she feels really frustrated/helpless/stuck.  Healing is possible for her though if she can find the right therapist and dietitian to help support her.  It will be important for her to keep in mind that a good practitioner will tell her that she can’t lose weight at first—but that doesn’t have to be her situation forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I too was a high functioning bulimic and essentially shifted everything around in my life in order to make enough room for my extreme behaviors while also holding down a prosperous career and all of its trappings.

I agree with what a lot of other people are saying on this thread, which is unfortunately that there is very little that can be done, except with respect to what the sufferer herself chooses to do. To have an eating disorder -- especially harboring one for many years -- is to be mentally ill. It is truly an addiction, and the sufferer is literally swimming in a sea of lies that she often cannot see her way out of until life shifts in a way that she begins to ""wake up."" This is something that one CANNOT be pushed or forced towards (even lovingly); my family's most well-intentioned efforts to get me to recover only caused me to draw closer to my eating disorder and to become more and more withdrawn and more private about it.

Because eating disorders are very much about secrecy, and are incredibly isolating as a result, I think the best thing you can do as a friend and sibling is to try to be a presence in her life, but be perceptive enough to note the difference between extending a hand and forcing one. My eating disorder was my closest and most dependable friend, and it also ironically felt like the safest companion -- people by comparison are quite complicated.

He’s going to feel like he’s been under some kind of watchful eye and it could lead him into even more secretive behaviors, OR he may pull away from you. Since he initiated the first conversation, you can simply say “since we last talked about this, I have some questions...” or “I’d like to know more...” or “how are you feeling since we discussed...”

I know as someone (M28) with AN I would feel very threatened and embarrassed having someone basically say “you’re drawing my attention and now I need to step in to save you.” 

It’s hard to know the right thing to say, but you have to come at it completely neutral and in a non-threatening way of the walls instantly go UP.

But it can morph into “unless I wash my hands, I am anxious” if that makes sense (yes it’s simplified but you know what I mean).

Basically it’s a habit you probably formed to cope with some other pain, and coping is good but when you’re always anxious without the coping mechanism it can be tricky. I’m not an expert in breaking habits, but talk to a therapist about how to go about it. Recovery is hard and you’re doing well, don’t be too hard on yourself.

The most important thing is that we eat and eat regularly.  The more regularly we eat, the less important individual meals become: it doesn't matter if the meal is exactly what I want because I can have x tomorrow.

If someone else is preparing food in your home, I'd go ahead and eat it because that's normal.  If you're feeling drawn to eat x then eat that because it's normal.  

If you know you like something, get some to stock up at home when you go grocery shopping. I'm not a fan of cooking.

As you get used to eating more normally, you'll start having cravings again and feel more excited about picking what to eat. For now, your mom's meals are probably good. Maybe you and your mom could take turns cooking and brainstorm meals you might want throughout the week?

It gets a bit murky with other compensatory behaviors but with purging, if you do it, it’s a serious issue. I think diagnostically frequency matters, for bulimia it’s maybe once per week for at least three months (not sure if having other symptoms like preoccupation with weight or feeling out of control when binging would mean that frequency/ duration criteria matters less but it’s possible they might). But as for seeking help, the emotional state that leads one to binge and purge even a single time is that of a person in crisis who needs help. Any therapist worth their salt would recognize that.

All the factors to make it an issue are there: negative body view, hating eating, eating for the wrong reasons (your parents, and you won't live there all your life), skipping breakfast while exercising a lot (or too much even), ...

If you just want to not gain weight again, there are so many healthy options to do it without skipping meals and without heavily restricting calories, certainly when you are motivated enough to exercise like you are doing.

My biggest advice: truely except for yourself that your current behavior is not healthy and will lead to an ED in the near future and change it around sooner than later. Eating a healthy breakfast will not make you gain weight at all, losing 6kg in a month every so often isn't a problem if you have some excess weight but do realize now that that isn't and shouldn't be the norm and now your BMI is 'normal' really avoid that.

Nipping this in the bud now will be A LOT easier than battling a 'real' ED in two years, be sure of that.

I think that recovery will look different for everyone but that reaching a life without the ed is definitely possible.  A place where you no longer use behaviors, you can accept (not necessarily love, but be okay with) your body, and ed thoughts are very minimal and easy to just move past.  

It sounds to me like you’ve made a lot of progress in recovery and that’s awesome!  Having good days is a really amazing thing.  But, the fact that you’re still engaging in behaviors at times and having lapses shows that there is still progress to be made.  It doesn’t mean that recovery isn’t possible, it just means that you have to sit down and be honest with yourself about where you are.  If you had a client who was in your situation, what would you tell him or her?  I’m guessing you’d recognize their progress but also very clearly see that they have more work to do.  And it really is work.  It’s painful to fully let go of behaviors.  It’s hard to rely solely on healthy coping mechanisms instead of falling back on the bad ones sometimes.  It isn’t easy at all to move past this “halfway” point in recovery.  But it is possible.  If you come to terms with where you’re at and commit to doing the next steps—stopping all behaviors and fully addressing the reasons your ed developed in the first place—I fully believe that you can get to the place in recovery that you’re wanting.  

Also I commend you for being aware of the dangers of treating ed patients while still having an active ed yourself.  I think that as someone who’s suffered you’ll have so many beneficial insights to offer other patients, but as you said, it’s really important to be in a truly recovered place when you take on that role.  Doing otherwise puts your recovery at risk as well as your patients’.  But truly, you can get there!

Like grieving, there will be triggers, maybe relapses but I think after the first time you make some progress in recovery, it builds your confidence in knowing that you not only recognize the signs, but know what to do, AND can do it. « IT » doesn’t have to mean « by yourself », it could mean knowing when and where to go to get help to overcome it. I don’t think there is any shame in having to do this a few times over the course of your life. It’s not any less painful each time but hopefully it gets easier to recognize the signs and nip it in the bud... 

I don’t think we ever « recover fully » from anything in our lives (now I’m getting philosophical)... we have scars, scratches, etc that remind us (not always in a negative way) where we’ve been and how far we’ve come. We just build the confidence to file it in the correct part of the brain that allows us to cope with situations and feelings in healthier ways.

We ALL have « recovered » from something before, we just take it for granted. If we think about it, and allow ourselves to take credit for it, maybe it could boost our confidence in knowing that we’ve « done it before ». I’m hoping!! This is what we need to tell ourselves when the doubt and the hopelessness set in... or this is what we need to remind OTHERS of when they go through rough phases. We always seem to accept empathy from others better than we do from ourselves, which is why this is such a great place. We may not be able to help ourselves feel better but we can lean on others here to help us do that and do the same for others...

My story will of course be different than anyone else's but ...I stopped resisting ""negative"" emotions and I didn't push any emotional pain away. I focused on being in my heart and allowing whatever was there. So when I was sad or angry or anxious, instead of using behaviors I just let myself be sad or angry or anxious. Interesting thing--it was much less difficult to suffer a wave of discomfort (and it does pass) than the eating disorder because in the eating disorder you're disconnected and that feels creepy. Much worse than just feeling the pain. Years later, I feel much more joy than pain. I think my brain chemistry actually changed-maybe from self-care because I protect myself. I never restrict, always get enough sleep, love my work, indulge my passions, have a spiritual life and try to help others and I do think we need to help others for our own wellness. xx .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was adopted by insurance companies in the early 1900s to determine what to charge policyholders (horrible!). Physicians and medical professionals were initially outraged by this, as they knew BMI tables had no medical basis, but eventually caved and adopted the model lest the insurance companies refuse to pay them. 

Your weight and size do not correlate to your value and misinformation has caused people to treat you poorly. We can’t change others, but we can educate ourselves with the truth. 

Please look for a HAES and/or non-diet dietitian. Focus on doing something for yourself at least once everyday that makes you feel good, and it will snowball. Slow and steady, one day at a time.

You don't need to have panic attacks to have valid anxiety.

Did your doctor explain your depression diagnosis or refer you to anyone?

It definitely sounds like you're under alot of stress and I'd really encourage you to reach out.
If you're a minor, ask a guardian or close relative, even a teacher you're comfortable speaking about it with to help you.

If you're an adult, schedule another appointment with a doctor, preferably one specialising in mental health.

Contact a psychologist if possible and set up regular appointments.

if you're hungry, eat, it's important to listen to our bodies.
If you're having episodes of over eating and craving greasy foods it could be because you aren't eating enough throughout the day or are lacking something in your diet.

Something is better than nothing. 
if you feel like skipping a meal, try replace it with a sandwich or some fruit. 
Even the smallest snack is better than nothing.

Stuff like eggs or carrots don't cost anything, so if you make something of an alternative schedule for him with cheap, but healthy foods and he buys into it, great, if not you may have a bit more proof he has an ED. 

Every ED is different and you can not make generalizations, but I don't feel like it's an ED per se, just someone with a very negative self-image who found a way of losing a lot of weight and with no general knowledge on how to keep that up in a healthy, cheap way.

They struggle with their weight, but don’t necessarily have the typical ed symptoms such as fear of food, fear of gaining weight, body image, etc. From what I learned from them, certain treatment places have made them feel isolated, mainly because the therapists didn’t have any training in that type of eating disorder. I have heard from one person that I met in treatment that she did better with an outpatient team rather than an intensive program. I feel the reason sometimes they get put or suggested to go to a treatment center is mainly to monitor your weight. If you have hyper metabolic syndrome, that can be deadly if not monitored. I would speak to your team about how you’re feeling to see if they understand. But quite honestly, the way I see residential treatment centers is a way to rehabilitate and make sure you’re okay medically, mentally, and behaviors have come to a slow or stop.

Most of the other clients had more clear-cut disorders and were much smaller than me, which made me feel like an outsider with invalid struggles. I voiced my feelings to staff throughout my stay and they were always incredibly supporting and validating.

I’m like you though, terrified of vomiting, no appetite, these things were great when I wanted to be thinner because I didn’t feel like I needed to try but now I’m trying to recover it’s so difficult. The generalised advice is to accept our bodies etc but I’ve done that and I still can’t eat. I’ve not found an inpatient program that’s individualised.

I try to stay away from making any statements about what I think about people who post because really, I'm not a professional.  All I can say is that I can relate so much to what you describe I'm feeling all of the feelings.  In 2008 I got a summer job at a cafe/bar.  One day it got to where my body and mind were suffering heat exhaustion so bad that I felt I had to break my rules and eat way outside my comfort zone.  When I ate and didn't die and actually enjoyed food I changed my rules...I thought I had fixed my eating problem because I no longer followed the rules I'd followed for years.  As it turned out, my new way of interacting with food and exercise were equally disordered.  I was still obsessive, just with different criteria.  My drinking got way worse and I saw people even less on top of the restriction.  I guess my point in sharing this is that years later, when I got help, I was able to see how bad it always was, that I hadn't chosen to quit my eating disorder, that it still held it's grips on my mind and life.  12 years later and recently out of treatment I am finally starting to see what life is all about when in remission.

I’m the same way with food, I hardly ever ate in high school for a couple of reasons: I was never hungry at 7am when breakfast was offered, I only ate a small amount during lunch because the food was awful, and when I’d get home i was so used to not having eaten that I wouldn’t be hungry anymore. 

In college I couldn’t afford to get food for myself and the dining halls were always closed when I’d get back from class. Once they reopened for dinner I wouldn’t be hungry anymore so my body got used to eating only a small amount of food every day. I still practice intuitive eating despite having food readily available at all times, I just... don’t eat? I’m still trying to figure out how to fix this for myself. Calorie counting apps have helped me reach my daily caloric goals, but some days I forget about them and I feel awful when I’ve realized I missed a day. 

Let the record show I’ve only gained 5 pounds since college, and it’s very easy for me to lose 10 if I’m not paying attention to making sure I eat.

1486,eyo9ko,DartInTheDark,1580820598.0,2020-02-04 06:49:58,"Consider researching  Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)  and see if any of that resonates with you. If you feel that may be your issue, you could look into finding a therapist who specializes in this sort of thing.

It looks like you have a strong psychological reaction to them, but also maybe a sensory issue (e.g. crunchiness)? 

I think what a lot of therapists do with patients who are trying to eat more variety of foods is try to acclimatize them gradually. You may be able to do this yourself. (Disclaimer: I'm no expert on any of this. I have some sensory issues myself, but thankfully not so much around food. I've just read about this.)

Try this:

1. For gradual acclimatization, maybe start by putting together a list of all/most (or even just a bunch) of foods you avoid but would like to be able to enjoy again. Also list (or think about) the foods that are comfortable and perfectly fine for you. 
2. Then go over your trouble list and try to pick maybe 1 or 2  items that are closest in experience to foods that you are comfortable eating. Maybe one of them has a similar colour and feel to one of your favourite foods, for example, but something else about it sets you off. These might be the easiest ones to start with. 
3. With the item(s) you've chosen (let's say you decide to start with carrot, for example), try setting some on a plate near you at first. Importantly, don't try to eat it yet. Just look at it once in a while. Remind yourself that you're not eating it yet, you're just looking at it. Remind yourself that it's harmless and you won't eat it before you're ready, so it's perfectly fine for it to just sit there near you.
4. When you're used to just having it near you (maybe you're already at that level of comfort), start adding touch to the routine. Just regularly touch that carrot with your hands. Give it a little poke! It's harmless. Maybe it feels revolting. Maybe it doesn't bother you so much. But touch it every day.
5. When you're used to seeing it and touching it, start giving it a little sniff. Don't touch it to your mouth; just wave it under your nose. Then just go about your day and forget about it. Keep doing this at least every day (maybe multiple times a day). Maybe it smells gross to you, but just smell it, acknowledge it, then move on to do something not food related at all.
6. Eventually the sight, finger-touch and smell of the food will be a lot more tolerable. Then you can start doing just the tinyest, briefest touch of the tongue. Don't even worry about tasting it. Just touch the tip of your tongue to the food briefly. You might barely taste it. Maybe you gag a bit, but that's fine. You're not eating it, you're just touching your tongue to it. (Could start with lips before tongue if that's too hard, then work your way up.) Remind yourself that you're not eating the food.
7. Next phase could be placing a bit of the food on your tongue. Again, don't chew, don't swallow it, just place it on your tongue briefly then remove it. If you think you'll have an easier time with it if it's cooked vs. raw, peeled vs. unpeeled, sliced vs whole etc. go with whatever format you think is closest to food you already accept. The first goal is to get used to the food in some format, doesn't have to be all of them.
8. With practice, you can probably reach a point where you can hold the food in your mouth longer without a reaction. Eventually it will probably bother you less to start moving it around in your mouth, maybe even chewing or at least biting down on it once.
9. Eventually, chewing the food will hopefully be more comfortable and you can actually eat a few bites!
10. Take it slowly and feel free to work on just one food at a time. From the beginning, you can figure out if it's easier for you if the food is cooked vs. raw, peeled vs. unpeeled, sliced vs whole, salted/peppered or plain etc. (veggies are wonderfully versatile). The goal is to get a point where you can stand eating the target item in at least one form. You can repeat the exercise later with different forms, once you get one of them down. 

We eat with all of our senses, and it can help to not overwhelm them. They can adapt. :) I hope this is helpful.",1reason_thats_me,1580853804.0,2020-02-04 16:03:24,"I have to eat veggies with meat or cheese on them lol. Salads, I can do since I enjoy the dressing and meat in it.

Resource post for bingeing:

Please consider reaching out to a therapist for at least an evaluation. It can be hard to make significant, long-term behavior changes like this one on your own. That being said, you are not powerless over this behavior, and you *can* change your behavior for the better starting today.

1. A physical and mental response to restricting food, whether that be amount of food or even just types of food.  Using ED behaviors of any type, including purging, can really mess with your body's metabolism, hunger cues, etc. as well as putting your brain into a scared restriction mode.  So after stopping those behaviors, it can take a while for your body to regulate itself.  The way to fix this is to continue eating what your body is asking for, whether it's physically asking with hunger or just mentally asking, and eventually your body will get comfortable again and things will even out.   Methods like the 60% rule and other similar strategies will only be harmful because they're physically and mentally restricting.  
2. Due to emotional issues.  One example is using food to numb out emotions you don't want to deal with, but there's a variety of ways emotions can consciously or subconsciously lead to bingeing.  In this case, the way to help is to go to therapy, work through the deeper issues, and develop healthier coping skills.

I would strongly recommend seeing a therapist, and an ED dietitian if possible, to help you determine what specifically is the reason behind your bingeing.  And congratulations on one month purge-free!  That's such an amazing step in the right direction and I'm very proud of you!",stpfah,1580693461.0,2020-02-02 19:31:01,"I'm so happy you are asking for help! 

My ED is deeply rooted as a coping device. Therapy with an expert has been the only way I have found to help untying eating/food from my emotional issue.

Also, my ED has changed over time. I'd always think I was getting over my ED (on my own) but really I was just changing my rules. The only way I could gain insight into what is really happening and effectively interrupt my behaviors was through treatment and continued therapy.

1491,excse6,the_scientist52,1580600475.0,2020-02-01 17:41:15,"I would really recommend having him see an ED dietitian to get some advice on how to best proceed.   The person can help determine how much his weight is actually putting him at risk, as sometimes that kind of thing can be dramatized among doctors and the general public.  And those with an ED history can be distorted about what their weight/size actually means, so having a professional opinion could really help him out.  In addition, someone who has experience with EDs can recommend ways to get healthier that actually are healthy and not laced with ED behaviors.  Because unfortunately, he probably has a distorted view of that, too, and could use help knowing what types of things are truly normal and not harmful.  

The dietitian doesn't have to be a long-term thing if he doesn't want it to be, but going a time or two would enable him to get some recommendations and know how to move forward in a healthy way.  And, if he does decide to continue the appointments, it could be a great way for him to have accountability for only doing what's recommended and not letting the ED make him go overboard.  

As for you, I can totally see how this could be a triggering situation!  I know it's easier said than done, but I would make sure to remind yourself that what your boyfriend is doing doesn't have to be what you do.  His body has different needs than you, and the healthy thing for **you** is to continue to maintain your recovery.  Another idea could be trying to distance yourself from what he's doing if you need to.  For example, say that you want to support him but request that maybe he doesn't talk about it or bring attention to it as frequently.  You can still be there for him and help him stay on track with his recovery without constantly discussing the specifics of what he's doing.",odorpeter,1580755747.0,2020-02-03 12:49:07,"Thank you for the advice! Tbh I didn't know ED dieticians were even a thing. I will ask him to see what he thinks. I was worried that it was too soon to ask for a professional consult, but it sounds like a good idea to try to help him initiate healthy habits before bad ones get established. 
We talk about everything and like to exercise together so I'm not sure I would be able to create a boundary there without cutting off an enjoyable shared activity. I will probably ask him not to mention weight or weight loss in quantitative terms, since numbers are still a problem for me. I'm also going to see if there's a way I can bring up my concerns with him without making it worse. Any suggestions? EDs are tricky bastards and I want to make sure the way I express my concern won't feed into the cycle.

Recovering is hard, it feels impossible sometimes, it takes forever to make small accomplishments, and the recovery is lifelong. By putting you in a position to consider your weight in comparison to his, he's hurting you when he should be there for you.

The thing that bothers me the most about this is that when somebody talks about wanting to lose weight or get in shape, it's pretty much always just a way of stating that they perceive fat as a negative thing that they really don't want. It's impossible to be around people like this without thinking-- well, if you're not even satisfied with your own body, what must you think of me?

I've been in a place before where I thought my partner understood my eating disorder recovery, she had been there for me for years, but after I gained weight she was definitely not pleased that I was fat. It came out when she was angry, it came out when she wanted to cheat on me and excused herself from our conversation by accusing me of ""literally only eating carbs and sugar"" so that I would get mad and she could stop responding. It's important to know that the person you're with accepts and loves you as you are.

I also want to say that a huge part of recovering from an eating disorder is learning how to be okay with your body.

If still in recovery, the body can need multiples of its normal calorie requirement, but if you've gotten past roughly the 50th percentile, your metabolic rate should be getting back into a normal range. 

Lifetime residual adaptive response, yes you will have somewhat elevated metabolism and increased ability to burn fat for energy. Another thing to consider is a diet high in carbohydrates will also juice the metabolism somewhat. 

As for getting into shape, consistency is more important than anything else, but it definitely helps to go fairly hard as soon as your body gets used to a training regimen - the reason being if you see and feel progress you'll be far more likely to stay with it and at least feel like the time is well-spent.

I would add that folks recovering from ED esp if they ever used exercise as a coping mechanism, should limit high volume circuit training/aerobics and just focus on overall strength. Also, if you do get into training you should not really get into using a scale for measuring progress, go by how much more weight you can lift, how much better you feel when training, how your clothes fit. The scale is a poor tool for measuring health unless you are either obese and medically need to lose weight or have a very low BMI and are trying to put on lean muscle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1495,ewoll4,green-egg-and-ham,1580487107.0,2020-01-31 10:11:47,Id say let him always talk first but let him kow that you are a confidential shoulder to lean on when he needs it. Let him knkw that you are touched that he chose you to confide in.,I-really-need-a-life,1580488361.0,2020-01-31 10:32:41,"I’m so glad you’re reaching out, you really do care about your brother and you seem like a really amazing sister 💕

Quick disclaimer fist: Try to remind yourself that no matter how tempting it may be, no matter how much you care about him, you can’t fix him. He can only fix himself. You can be the most incredible support in the world, but if he doesn’t want to recover, it’s gonna be incredibly difficult to do anything.

On that note, here’s a few ideas:

• If he’s not seeing a therapist already, help him find one. An amazing resource I really like is PsychologyToday, since you can type in your postal code and filter by topic to find the best therapists for your issue in your area!! I’d also strongly recommend seeing a dietitian if you can, who specializes in EDs.

• Another tip would be to do as much research on EDs as possible. NEDIC, NEDA, and BEAT are some amazing resources that come to mind, and i’d strongly suggest reading as much as you can on them.

• As for in-the-moment support, try to be available to listen, and don’t judge him for what he’s saying. His logic might seem absolutely ridiculous, but please, don’t judge. The deadliest symptom of EDs are shame and silence, so to break that silence is doing a lot of good!!

• Try to avoid talking about things like dieting, weight, calories, etc., as they can be incredibly triggering. Along those lines, try to avoid commenting on what he’s eating or how he looks. I remember for me personally, I had a lot of weird food “rituals”, which always seemed funny/startling to my parents, and they never failed to point them out. That only lead to me eating alone in my room in secret. Things to avoid saying would be, “You look healthy”, or “Are you really gonna eat all that?”, or “Is that all you’re gonna eat?”, or “Wow that’s a lot of junk food”, or things like that. Just try to avoid talking about how they look, even if it’s a compliment, because ED brains can really screw up how you interpret things.

• If you can, avoid saying those things about yourself too in front of him. Try to avoid saying things like, “Oh my god i’m so fat!” or, “wow I ate so much today, gotta burn off those calories” or, “oh my god I just lost XYZ pounds!”.

• Distractions!! If you guys still eat together, maybe watch a movie, play a board game, or even just chat about anything. Whatever gets the focus off of the food. Distractions after supper are key too- maybe hang out for a bit to get his mind off of things?

• The worst thing you could possibly do is say something like, “if you don’t put in more effort/if you don’t eat/if you keep purging/if you don’t get better, I’ll stop talking to you”

• This is the most important one, above all else: Look after yourself. Supporting someone with an eating disorder is EXHAUSTING, so always take care of yourself, always put your OWN health first, and if you feel like you’re having trouble, go see a therapist too. It’s like those oxygen masks on airplanes. They always tell you to put on your own mask before you put on your kids’ masks. Why? Because if you try to save your kids first, you run the risk of passing out from lack of oxygen, and suddenly both you and your kids are dead. But if you put on your mask, you’ll have enough air to help your kids!! Same goes for the cliché phrase- don’t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. It’s hard seeing someone with an ED struggle, and it’s amazing that you want to support your brother, but your own mental/physical health is your first priority",ilivetomosh,1580492339.0,2020-01-31 11:38:59,"A lot of the time with eating disorders there's underlying trauma. It's usually not as simple as wanting to lose weight or trying to be attractive. I would say, even if he hasn't realized himself, there's a good chance there's something going on right now that needs to be dealt with that's causing the disorder. Sometimes, working with that is better, like treating the ""cause"" instead of just treating the ""symptoms"". For many there's trauma, like abuse, a recent death, or maybe divorce or illness. It's hard to talk about these things when you don't have the tools to fix it, and sometimes it's best left to a professional, but he might just want his sister to confide it, because he knows you and trusts you. This is a huge deal to be trusted in this way with something so personal. Don't make him regret it. Be kind and patient and unless he explicitly says it's ok, or it's suddenly a life or death situation, and the person can help, don't spread it around. As a guy with an ed, there is so much stigma and that can add extra stress and pressure to be ""perfect"" around others.  I'm sorry if I just rambled and didn't help much.

My recommendation is to take that knowledge and find a doctor who can refer you to a trained therapist. Universities usually have fairly robust mental health counseling, so this shouldn't be too much of a problem. The reasons for doing what you're doing are concerning and should be addressed properly. Left untreated, your mental health will decline further, as will your physical health.

Not eating definitely gives you less energy, and makes it hard to have motivation to do things, similar to depression. I got swept up in the competition of finding a job and stopped eating as a method of control. When I weighed myself a week later, I saw I lost a few pounds and was satisfied with my results. This only made me keep going with the not eating.

I wasn't ready to accept that this was a problem until I was hospitalized for depression/suicidal thoughts a week ago, and the psych eval said that I had an eating disorder. I still struggle to recognize this as an issue, but at least in the back of my head I slightly know what I'm doing is wrong. Last August, I was a healthy weight, but now I'm underweight. I thought I had everything under control, but now that nagging thought of ""you can lose more"" or ""you still look overweight"" won't go away. What started as a coping mechanism for stress kinda spiraled out of control. I still can't figure out how to eat a normal amount of calories, or even just enough to maintain weight.

OP - please start eating more. It may not seem like an issue but you may lose control without noticing. I somehow made it through the first year of university without having too many mental issues. When you start eating again, you should have an increase in energy. If you need support, feel free to pm me.

I say I don't want to but part of me is happy about losing weight. I think it's unhealthy and might be going down a dangerous path, if you have to question it then maybe it isn't healthy. My healthy eating habits tend to always turn into not eating enough, but not counting calories, so that way I don't know how little I'm eating. It seems like you realize this may be an issue, keep an eye on it, especially since you say you're already underweight.

i think she often cant see how shes struggling. she becomes more functional instead of less when shes struggling to prove that shes doing fine, even if she isnt. she thinks that since shes financially secure and nobody is dying that everything is okay. if things arent then prayer and positivity is all you need. 

thats why i feel so stuck here. any help that isnt from a therapist gets brushed off because she has that perspective and is very stuck in it. even therapists are a bit iffy because shes had some experiences with bad ones. my dad and mom work the same job and share all their finances so online therapy likely wouldnt be an option. if i were able to id pay for the whole family to go to therapy but i hardly have any money. i keep trying to think of any other options but i feel im out of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's uncomfortable, stressful, and disheartening. I'm so sorry you're going through this. 

This is what helped me:

There are a lot of very smart people out there who have experienced overshoot weight and can encourage you and provide information. I always gravitate towards free options (the food Psych podcast, Kayla Rose All In YouTube videos). I've found that it's more productive for me to absorb content created by people who have been in recovery for a while. It also filled my obsessive need to know what was happening with my body and why. 

My overshoot weight was the result of alternating between eating disorders that were starving my body. When I first started truly nourishing my body I gained weight rapidly because my body didn't know if another long period of starvation was coming. It was biologically programmed to prepare for more starvation and that involved gravitating toward the higher end of my set point range. When I viewed the weight gain as my body trying to protect me, it helped reframe it out of the context of whether or not I could ""afford"" to gain weight. I just had to trust my body, my appetite, and my energy levels. Is gaining weight fun? Nope! But it eventually stops. I recommend buying new clothes. Trying to force myself into old clothes was traumatic. 

It's not easy. It's extremely hard, but it does get easier. After going through recovery, I don't think I could ever go back. I really value the relationship I've cultivated with my body that involves honoring my hunger and not punishing myself with restriction or exercise. 

Again, I'm sorry you're going through this. I hope this can help, although I understand if we're in different places with our approaches.

Thank you for your help, it’s good to know I’m not alone.",OwlCant,1582212737.0,2020-02-20 09:32:17,"You're not alone at all. I've felt everything you're describing. To me, your feelings are normal and part of the process.

I don't know if you're familiar with this statistic, but something like 98% of people who try to lose weight (I think the statistic refers specifically to dieting) gain all of the weight they lose back. And of those people, I think it's something like 60% that will go on to gain more weight than they lost (overshoot). That's why the weight loss industry is really the weight cycling industry, and every time you weight cycle your body gets better at protecting you from starvation. We don't currently have safe and effective means of long term weight loss. No matter what the myriad of advertisements and before/after pics try to tell you. So when you say you are embarrassed of the weight gain, I completely understand. But I also don't think you have anything to be embarrassed about. It's the normal result of trying to control it change our bodies through disordered eating, and our body responding defensively to the restriction. 

And if weight gain is something you really want to avoid, then it seems like going through the process now rather than weight cycling a couple more times first will actually give you the lower overshoot weight. But regardless of what your weight is, you deserve respect and love and you have value.

I think being vegan is incredibly admirable and a standard to which we should strive. I also am not, and probably will never be, vegan.

Why not? Eating disorder. As soon as I make a hard rule about foods I can and can't eat, my eating disorder jumps on it, creating more and more restrictions and rules about ""good"" and ""bad"" foods. And on and on it goes, until soon I'm back into a full-blown relapse.

Now, does this mean that people with eating disorders can't be vegan? Of course not. Another commenter mentioned how ethical eating helped them alleviate the guilt associated with food. My point is 1) that everyone is different and 2) secure your own mask before helping others.

You can still take steps toward reducing your reliance on animal products in ways that don't have to do with diet, like avoiding leather, silk, and wool, for instance. I eat vegan and vegetarian food a lot, especially at restaurants, and most new recipes I try are meat-free.

Everybody's different, but I found that my relationship with food really benefited from giving my body whatever it wanted, whenever it wanted it. That might sound counter to ""controlling cravings"" but my relationship with food really improved after approaching recovery like this. 

Eating intuitively can feel like a weird concept when you're coming from the BED side of things, but I've learned if you're experiencing binging, also look to see if you are restricting in some way.

It’s not a permanent solution, especially when you’re trying to gain muscle, but just switching up the ritual can really have an impact on your mindset.

I will listen to ED recovery podcasts (Food Psych) starting the moment I wake up and scroll through my carefully curated and very private/secret Instagram that tends to have more wordy posts than pictures of other people's bodies. I'll also watch Kayla Rose, All In vids on YouTube. 

Also, therapy with a therapist who specializes in eating disorders can be extremely helpful. Of course, there can be prohibitive costs associated with those resources. 

I know you know this, but eating isn't about deserving to eat. You don't ""deserve"" or ""not deserve"" to breathe. You just must. The weight cycling industry tries to destroy our intuitive relationship with food and hunger by pretending that eating isn't like our other natural bodily functions, but it is. You must breathe. You must sleep. You must eat.

I've been only properly recovering for the past 6 months and i wish i coudve stopped it earlier because the longer you take to seek help the harder it is to recover.  I had a few fall backs throughout this year but you have to promise to yourself to not do it no matter how hard it is.

Your mental health always comes first and you cant get the body you want or feel happy about yourself unless you're healthy mentally first. I found that out only recently. I was always overweight and no diet worked until recently when I realized that eating whatever I wanted just fed my body properly I started to lose weight but it really doesn't happen overnight. 

Tip for recovery is to tell someone close and someone you trust. Try to avoid watching videos on fitness or eating disorders couse they can be triggering ( it is at least for me) .  Another very important thing is that you have to remember that it's you that needs to get better and you're the only one who can do it  and it might feel like you're in it alone but just remember that there will be someone to help you .

Asking if you're trying to lose weight gives the therapist an idea of both where your mind is at and what behaviors you could be using.  Asking if you were overweight as a child could give a clue into where the ED started (i.e. were you bullied for your weight?) or just an overall idea of what your eating habits could have been throughout your life.  To me the questions sound a lot like your therapist is just trying to find out more about your ED, and if you haven't been seeing the person for long, they could still aiming to get all of the initial info.

With that said, if it makes you uncomfortable you should speak up.  Tell them just what you told us.  ""When you ask \_\_\_\_, it makes me think you're saying \_\_\_\_.""  Give them a chance to explain why they're asking.  My ED tends to twist things a lot so checking the facts and just flat out asking for an explanation has been a great skill for me.  Plus if your therapist doesn't know that you're uncomfortable, they won't know to make changes or ask the questions in a different way.  

If the conversation doesn't go well or you still feel iffy, find a new therapist.  If yours isn't an ED specialist, I'd recommend switching to one anyway because that truly makes all of the difference.

A lot of trans people experience a eating problem when transitioning because hormones effect your body differently than you're accustomed to, and you want to have the ideal body of the gender you're transitioning to, etc. It's not uncommon for new eating habits to become overwhelming and cause one distress. 

My point is this should be something your transition doctor can readily help you with.

Also, for the eating being hard... it IS hard... but I have found that the less you focus on what you're eating, the easier it is. The deeper into the hole of disordered eating you get, the more you think about food. It can cause you to overthink and heighten your senses to food to an unpleasant level. I have found success with watching something that really requires my attention while eating, like foreign movies or anime with subtitles, or just a really complex plot. I can redirect some of the hyper focus to the TV so my mouth can just get the eating part done.

If you have Instagram, follow body positive people, eating disorder recovery pages etc. In my own recovery (with a therapist) I started following a diet plan which was basically 3 meals a day with 3 snacks (one after each meal so you end up eating every few hours). It’s so difficult at first, and I still have to remind myself that I deserve to eat, but honestly just eating regular meals that were pre-planned helped me SO much, because my mind wasn’t thinking about food all the time anymore. I still think about dieting but I just force myself to eat those 3 meals and 3 snacks and it’s done wonders for me. I haven’t gained any weight, in fact I’ve been the most stable weight ever since the last 7 years (I used to fluctuate between the same 5-7 kilos because of dieting and binging). There’s an app that you can get (if you have a phone) called recovery warrior, and to can use it to track meals and feelings etc (then you can see patterns) but I honestly only use it for the notifications which remind me to eat. Super useful when you have a busy day and just forget sometimes, or if your eating disorder is telling you to skip it then you see the notification come up and it’s a very real reminder to eat something.

Having a baby is a huge change, having issues in your marriage, depression... so easy to control diet when so many aspects of your life can’t be controlled as well.

Also, when someone eats, it turns on the nervous system that controls “rest and digest” and eating is actually calming. So having anxieties and not eating makes them worse and throws you in a never ending cycle because being too nervous shuts off rest and digest. Fight or flight reaction 24/7.

I think having side effects is legitimate, my ADD meds quiet my appetite and I’ve definitely let restricting or not eating just happen because I don’t feel like I NEED to and am still motivated somewhere internally by a desire to lose weight. something that lessens your appetite can be utilized via ED behaviors, but it doesn’t mean you’re weak or haven’t made progress! it’s challenging, new meds/stressors/work/change are all things that can intensify things like this. side effects are a real thing, but the fact that you’re purging weekly is a big big sign that ED thoughts are the main driving force here. I’d address that primarily, feel free to PM if you need anything!",R0ck01,1582598654.0,2020-02-24 20:44:14,"My understanding is one can pop up first and intensify or compliment the other. Whether it's the e.d. or the meds that started a feeling or urge. 

I'm struggling with that too. I get nausea due to health issues and nausea is unfortunately also a stress reaction for me. But when I urge to purge even when I'm not feeling nauseous....that's an e.d. sign. 

Another thing.... when I first started throwing up years ago, it was a med reaction of increased nausea (I already had stress nausea sometimes but didn't purge to appease it). But I realized from the medicine.... that purging feels good and put it in my pocket as a stress tool... even a fixing preventative tool, or ""feel good"" thing (urges even when no physical nausea feeling). 

Past years, there were things that intensified the nausea. Like pregnancy and lower esophageal candida overgrowth. And now, positional vertigo. In ways I can choose to not purge. But sometimes my body just had to let it out. But if I did that, it took all of me to not let the additive part add onto it. Also, the meds that brought on nausea, sometimes I crave them to increase nausea to throw up. 

Idk if that makes sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm a uni student, and have very low confidence. I think my weight obsessio n was triggered last year when I was in high school and someone called me overweight while I was on the heavier side, but still healthy. Furthermore, everyone treated me as useless there. The place f'd me up and basically gave my brain the idea that I'm only worth something if I'm as pretty and skinny as all the other girls were. When I came to uni I finally got to control my habits (my parents are wonderful, but obviouslh made sure that I ate well at home) and eat as little as I wanted. Since uni I've been surrounded by people who are wonderful and supportive,  but I always get the idea, although ridiculous, that if I don't keep losing weight and look thin I'm going to be thrown aside. It doesn't help that the UK uses coloured labels for food and that I have to get cantine food on most days, which is just straight up garbage.

A slight silver lining is though that next year when I live off campus I can cook my own food, and alrhough that might be hard as I'm worried I just won't, I actually have a friend who studies EDs, so I'm going to have to eat, or they will likely pick up on it. Also, I love horseriding, meaning that I want to be able to stay healthy enough to ride, which usually serves as a motive for me to eat at least one meal a day.

Even now, I still hate everything about myself though. I hate the mirror. It makes me look fat. Everything is too big (I'm quite tall and broadshouldered in comparison to most which makes me feel even fatter as all my body parts ard slightly bulkier even though most girls tend to have a less bulky build). I know I've dropped from a US 10 to a US 6 (need to wear a size 8 though due to my broad shoulders), but I still feel the same weight.


At first  my brain realized it was a problem, so I tried to get help from the uni and they basically told me that it wasn't serious enough and I had to do the online course (full of these articles and motivational videos, so useless to me). I couldn't talk to anyone they said. After that I guess I gave up. I don't have any extremely close friends I can talk to, as I have no friends from childhood and I don't trust my new ones enough. As for my family, I don't want them to worry even more about me and think me incapable of taking care of myself.

 I did try and reach out to the uni (I'm a student) wellbeing centre and they told me that my problem wasn't serious enough for counselling. I also tend to drop hints to my parents and sister who are definitely catching on, but they always, although meant in a nice way, tell me I'm overreacting.

If you need help, ask for it and get it any way you can. Unless they are ED professionals or HAES specialists, therapists can be very uneducated about what is an ED and how to help patients suffering from it. Don’t let a couple bad experiences deter your from continuing to look.


I had an ED for 20years and no matter how hard you find it to fight it now, do it because the longer you wait, the worst it gets and harder to get rid of it. There is no single person I know with an ED who is happy.

You talk about sizes but they don’t matter whatsoever. I was at my most unhappy and insecure at my thinnest and now loving life and myself like I never thought possible, completely unrelated to my weight.

I highly recommend getting help, there are apps with therapists and such but you have to WANT to recover. You can start the work on your own but it will be much faster and easier to go through the trial and error path with a good team of professionals.
You have to be ready to dig deep and choose recovery every day. Recovery is work but man, the prize at the end is AH MAY ZING!!
Do everything you can to help with recovery: tell people, don’t hide and keep shame around it or try to get away with it, lying to friends constantly about your eating habits... it’s just a downward spiral you want no part of. I lost many friends over my ED. It even made me decline being a bridesmaid at one of my very good friend’s wedding and decline going altogether because I was too self conscious to be in a dress in public and have my picture taken... that friend doesn’t talk to me anymore for bailing on her wedding. So sad to miss out on these things over what? No one will remember me for my pant size. They’ll just remember me for what I did or said, or didn’t do.

The thing about bodies is that you cannot fight genetics. Some people are built one way, and others another way. Everyone wants what they don’t have, and you are a completely worthy human being no matter what you look like. I deleted instagram and FB for a while during recovery to stop brainwashing me with photoshopped pictures of models. Even models don’t look like that in real life: makeup, airbrushing, photoshop... 

Your pant size tells me absolutely nothing about who you are. Losing weight also tells me absolutely nothing about what I want in a friend. I want someone who is kind, generous, open, honest... nothing to do with appearance, ever. The image in the mirror is NOT what determines your worth.",munchmint,1582877344.0,2020-02-28 02:09:04,":(  it really sucks that for mental health problems to be treated they have to develop to the point it’s completely taken over your life - like if you had a cancerous Mole they wouldn’t wait for it to spread. But anyway the only thing I could suggest would be to constantly redirect your mind when you start falling into those starving periods. 

It sounds silly but look at body positive models, try switching to a diet which doesn’t make you feel guilty after eating (I went vegan it surprisingly helped!), and just repeat the mantra that you’re worth so much more than your weight; wish I could help more :( I really hope you the best!

I had a traumatic first year of my life and had intense anxiety since I was adopted, because I was abandoned at 3 days old and put in an impoverished orphanage in a rural village. I was so severely ill that I needed emergency medical care as soon as I was adopted. Understandably, I experienced a sense of unpredictability and uncontrollability from a young age that made me obsessed with needing to control something.

Being abandoned played a role in my self-worth. Growing up, my only internal explanation for why my birth mother could put me down as a newborn and walk away was that I did something wrong and was inherently worthless. My mom was a health nut growing up, and my dad was a chronic dieter who would gain and lose weight rapidly, so I associated ""overweight"" with ""bad"". Since I was a worthless and unlovable person, I must also be fat.

Combine those two things, and that's why I developed anxiety, OCD, and eventually my ED. I had restrictive eating behaviors even as a baby; I was extremely malnourished at adoption (I wasn't even on the charts because I was so tiny) and it was a battle to keep my weight up as I would go days refusing to eat.

I was praised when I lost weight and shamed if I put any back on or ate any foods that were considered “bad”. I ultimately developed starvation behaviours and felt a sense of pride whenever I managed to get my calorie count down, sometimes to horrifyingly low levels, because it meant when my weight inevitably dropped from the lack of nutrition I’d see the loving glow in my parents eyes and I’d feel closer to having their love and acceptance. My methods were never questioned and I don’t think my parents ever realised how bad it got. When my diets failed, as they were always going to, I’d put the weight back on and then some. Cue the judgemental and shame-filled comments from my parents. It was a vicious cycle.

If both people are committed to working on recovery and putting that first in their lives, it could be a supportive environment in which both people could thrive. In yours, it seems that you’re both very competitive with each other, and any sort of attempt at accountability will only breed more comparison and secretiveness.

I think you need to take a long, hard look at what this relationship is doing for you. Is it allowing you to be supported and work on your own shit? Or is it allowing you to brush it under the rug and avoid it because of the fear of losing or triggering your partner? The answer seems clear, but something to think on.

I understand the not being able to see a doc or therapist because I could not afford it myself when I figured out I had an eating disorder and wasn’t just stupid about my eating habits.

Find free resources in your area: group therapy in hospitals, or online support groups, etc...
If money isn’t the issue but you can’t because of shame/family: apps are now around that offer therapy and can help you with confidentiality.

Know that recovery is possible. Know that you can do it without a doctor if you absolutely cannot get one but it is much easier and faster with the right team of professionals.

There is nothing to be ashamed about, get rid of the guilt and stigma you self-inflict on your situation. Ask for help. It’s so hard but ask. Tell your family.

Free yourself. I know it may not be an option but distance yourself as much as you can. It’s not because your family has been brainwashed by diet culture that you have to endure this.
Just like there are different hair and eye and skin colors, there are different body types. Some bodies just do not function properly at certain sizes. So many industries benefit on insecurities to sell their products that having the general population think that the lower the number on the scale the better is what keeps them afloat: health coaches, fitness industry, supplement industry, waist trainers, tea companies etc... even BMI is a total load of BS (read the history on that and be shocked). 

If you don’t know her already, read Megan Crabbe’s book on body positivity. Diet culture is a bitch, we don’t need it in our lives. 

And remember YOU ARE FABULOUS! You are not your body, you are a college-educated woman worthy of love. Your weight should never be the focus of who you are.

Just thinking “i have to be careful and try not to overeat” is restrictive thinking. It doesn’t have to be calorie counting, you don’t even have to undereat, just setting a rule like “no touching the cake for dessert” can trigger a binge.

Your body has to learn to trust you again and for that you need to give up all rules around food. It’s a process, it takes time, but it’s the only thing that will set you free.
Even with binge eating disorder and not being underweight or nutrient deficient, the solution is to stop restricting.

This caused me to feel similar things about my body even though every time I went to the doctor they told me I was on the “lower side of normal”. I was never actually underweight but I was definitely skinnier. Also I had a cousin who tried to convince me that my mother had said I was too skinny and ugly looking. I know my mother and am sure she never said this. Especially since I was in the normal range and there was no reason for her to be worried about my weight.

Imo, recovery really starts when that period ends, because you can only relearn healthy eating habits if you're trying to eat intuitively to begin with, and an abnormally powerful appetite makes that decision making impossible. Don't feel bad about it because you're very early on in the stage of recovery where figuring out this stuff is hard. 

Imo the only way you can combat this is by deliberately acting against those thoughts. I never had much difficulty with specific foods, but when I was recovering from OCD I found that every time I did the exact opposite of what my intrusive thoughts were telling me to do, the dread associated went down. I've also tried this during ED recovery, and it was successful in that respect too.

If, for example, you're in a restaurant and you're about to order dessert, and your brain is telling you ""you don't need a dessert, you've eaten enough, anything else will be excessive, they're not getting dessert so you shouldn't"" etc etc, try your best to order a dessert anyway. The next time you find yourself in that situation, getting the dessert won't be as hard because you've done it before, and so on until it's just a completely in-the-moment decision with no influence from your ED.

I still feel like eating more after my meal, but then I wait it out. Usually I get a coffee to help. 30 minutes or so later that feeling is gone. 

My last trick is whenever I feel like eating, I ask myself the question ""are you hungry? Or do you just want to eat?"" If it's the later, I wait. 

I also stopped following the 3 meal a day concept. I realized it made me eat at times when I was not hungry, but I could still eat the whole meal. I would end up being hungry at 10~11pm despite having had more food on that day. By eating less overall, it made me less hungry and full more easily. I don't know if my stomach adjust over time to the quantity I eat... but really, I would get full with half the food I used to eat if I didn't not fall back. 

I felt back for a month, and all those habit came back. 10~11pm snacking... eating a full meal even if I wasnt hungry... using food as a ""take a break / distraction"". 

I literally follow /r/stopdrinking for advice and support to control my sweets intake. I've realized that my relationship with sugar is nearly identical to an alcoholic relationship with alcohol. It's not as apparent, because I don't end up drunk if I go for it. Society also just doesn't see it that way.

I know it goes against all ED advice (don't demonize foods, don't cut out food groups) but honestly it is the only thing that works *for me* long term.  I have had BED basically my whole life.  I have been through so many types of therapy, seen so many psychologists and psychiatrists, but nothing works like eating low-carb.  Without carbs food becomes sustenance.  I still love the taste but I'm satisfied when I've eaten enough, I don't obsess about food and I can actually slow down and control what and how much I eat, compared to on carbs where I am completely insatiable and out of control.",Xgx9,1582205061.0,2020-02-20 07:24:21,"The first and foremost advice I can give you is - don't restrict. As you've noticed yourself, you ""starve and then binge"". One always leads to another, and there's no way around it. Any doctor or psychologist will tell you this. Although physical hunger is not the only reason we eat and overeat, it's definitely a major one.

Other than that, try and figure out what emotion(s) hide behind your binge eating. Are you more likely to eat when you're anxious? Or maybe you're trying to eat away your sadness? Is it loneliness? Or is it boredom? When you know what to look for (that is, what is your emotional trigger), practice noticing it as it appears, and just sitting with the feeling for a while instead of acting on it. This way you will teach your brain to be more tolerant of emotion, and over time you will literally unlearn to automatically think of food when you're experiencing emotion(s). Although this sounds simple, I appreciate that it is not easy. Oh, and as a sidenote, this will not work properly if you're restricting in the meantime, because a hungry brain will always think of food first, no matter the emotion.

In the meantime, I would suggest you also work on your body image. Not when you're ""lighter"", not X kilos later, - right now. Recovery from a binge eating disorder does not guarantee a smaller body size. Recovery is still worth it, it 100% is, it means psychological freedom from food, and it feels great! But you have to accept that recovery (despite of what some advertisements say) doesn't come with a promise of a ""model figure"". And any good ED recovery programme will therefore work on body image in addition to food issues. So yes, work on your body image too.

Personally I liked the “8 Keys to Eating Disorder Recovery” better. “50 Ways to Soothe Yourself Without Food” was good for alternatives to eating when you feel emotional. I would pick something to do for a period of time and then try different things and come back to seeing if I was really hungry. It helped me break the binge and purge cycle. Still working on getting to a healthy eating pattern. Right now I have only been focusing on not eating when emotional and just if I am hungry but I do become restrictive since I have that tendency as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do NOT make any remarks about their weight or body shape. No comments on how they eat or how they should eat. We do not see food and exercise and all that the way other people do. There is a filter in our heads that can make the most innocuous comments about weight eating etc that gets fueled by any remarks on it. 

Even if it's not directed towards them if someone I'm with says someone else is fat my brain immediately goes ""you were disgusting and everyone will comment on your nasty fat weight if you get to that size you have to do xy and z to avoid being that heavy. "" Or something similar. 

If you notice binging don't be a dick about it. Don't tell them it's bad for them, don't suggest exercise or any other alternative. DO NOT TELL THEM THEY LOOK HEALTHY. If you call someone with an Ed healthy it's extremely upsetting and makes us feel like we're not thin enough or we suck at having eds or something. 

Just all body and weight and eating and exercise comments are off the table. 

Do not ask if another friend seems to have a problem with food. I hate it when my friends do that. 

I love questions about Ed's though. But they have to be things like ""why do you guys like to watch documentaries about Ed's?"" ""How are you so lucid about having a disorder and driven to fuel it at the same time."" Of course not out of the blue or anything.

In my experience, having an eating disorder is a very isolating and weirdly competitive experience. I used to compare myself to others and whenever someone seemed to have it worse than me I would completely dismiss my own feelings and mark my illness down as ‘not that ill’, even though I was just as bad too. Regardless of how long it’s been going on, and even if you don’t fit in a particular diagnosis criteria, if you’re struggling, you’re experiencing some form of disordered eating, you deserve help for it.

On the other hand, I may not be binging or purging -- I have no *external* evidence of disease -- but in the way my mind works, my ED is still there. The urges still crop up. I have to be careful of triggers. I recognize some behaviors as dangerous. Whether or not I'm acting on it, I still have an eating disorder.

Yes. I feel truly recovered. I probably have about as many, or possibly even fewer (because I've trained myself to recognize that line of thinking in myself) body-hate moments compared to the average person. 

I've been in a solid state of recovery for almost 5 years now after nearly a decade with eating disorders. My last real relapse only lasted 1 weekend and it was over two years ago. I purged all weekend, told my boyfriend (now husband), he helped me through a couple weeks of bad thoughts.

Now, a few months ago (when I joined this sub) I had a couple weeks where I thought I was going to relapse. Anxiety has always diminished my appetite, I was dealing with PTSD treatment at the time, it was a bad time. But I got through it none the worse. And honestly, I think I have a healthier relationship with food and my body. 

I've really leaned in to the idea of radical self acceptance the last several years. I had to. I had gotten pregnant with my son (my motivation to truly recover), I couldn't risk the pregnancy, I had to learn how to deal with a rapidly growing and changing body.

Are there things I'd change about my body? Hell yeah. Is having the aesthetic I want worth losing everything my body can *do* and risking more health complications and making myself miserable? Fuck no. So I accept my body as it is. I'm not super in love with it, like oh yeah I'd fuck me lol. But who is? I respect my body for what it can do and am mostly ""meh"" about the way it looks. I'm not a big fan, but it's whatever. I've taught myself (with a lot of therapy and a lot of repetition) that how I look really only matters to me, and I choose to let everything else in my life matter more.",13thConfession,1583295606.0,2020-03-03 22:20:06,"Tabitha Farrar published an E-book specifically about neural re-wiring, which I believe is necessary for full mental recovery. It's available on Amazon and it's like 4 dollars. I'd recommend ALL her other books as well, she changed my life. She also has a YouTube channel which is a treasure trove of recovery material.

To me, trying to overcome the mental part of ED is not that different from dealing with co-morbid OCD with anorexia. In a lot of cases, the OCD doesn't develop until someone is years into the illness, that's what happened to me. I've been facing fear foods, gaining weight, really really trying to rewire my thoughts around food and body image. Things have really changed so much!

But the OCD? It expresses itself in a few different ways and because I'm so distracted with maintaining my recovery from ED, it's hard to do the hardcore work with the OCD.

For instance, I check to make sure the stove is off a lot. When I get stressed out, it gets worse. I have to check it before I leave the house, and before I go to bed. Always multiple times. Sometimes I even have to get out of bed to go check it again, when I don't want to.

BUT.

I travel for work a lot. Sometimes I'm gone for a month or so. When I come home, there's always at least one day where it doesn't occur to me to check the oven. Because I've been gone so long, it's like the information is de-prioritized in my brain and it forgets I used to care about it. Then I remember and I slowly slip back into checking the oven again.

So, my point here is, obviously we have to think about food and our bodies every single day. It's impossible not to. So those neural pathways are getting worn in over and over forever. We don't have a chance to not think about it. So you have to actively do things to contradict your ED mindset, to show your brain the worry/fear isn't warranted.

You can be eating SO MUCH and GAIN WEIGHT, but if you still really think that it's bad/dangerous/unhealthy to do so, you're not going to rewire anything. You have to try to reframe things to get over the fear. It takes a long time but it's totally possible. Question your beliefs about how bodies should look, try to understand how irrational your fear of food is. Brains are neuroplastic. With time and effort, we can change certain things. The automatic fear response to food and weight gain can be overcome.

I also think a certain level of weight gain must be attained before your brain can work well enough to work on rewiring. Even if you've gained weight before and then lost it.

Sorry so long! I believe full recovery is 100% possible. There are people who have done it, and those people were horribly horribly ill before. I think it's only possible by committing to feeling very uncomfortable for a long time and refusing to give in to the urge to act out behaviors or lose weight. Full recovery isn't NEARLY as common as quasi-recovery for very obvious reasons. Don't let anyone tell you it isn't possible.

Being able to eat popcorn when I go to the movies, listening to my body when it craves something, having a little more energy, the way my skin cleared up- it’s small things I focus on that mean recovery to me.

So when I had or have weird food or body image thoughts, I ask myself is this me talking or is this Edna? And after a while she became kinda like an annoying or kinda abusive friend where it was like “yeah ok Edna that’s terrible advice but thanks for speaking up I guess”. I know it sounds kinda weird but it helped. Really proud of you for recognizing you’ve slipped back into old habits.",canyonlands2,1583333874.0,2020-03-04 08:57:54,"Thank you! I feel like it’s pretty relatable for most people who have struggled with an ED to have a hard time in recovery because of associating it with your identity. I find it hard as mine started when I was young and hit hardest when I’m a teenager. It was part of who I was for so long that in a way it’s a safety net to revert to.

Without a doubt, it takes a lot of time, energy, determination and most importantly, a good network of support with professional help.

Because eating, or the lack of eating is so vital to our existence as humans, recovery is a muddied image. We're constantly exposed to the things that trigger us. This isn't like alcohol where I can excise it from my life completely and isolate myself from most triggers. Food isn't something I can just say no to – after all isn't that the root of the issue?

But that isn't a sign of despair. I'm recovered now after going way down the path of ED, and I've mostly made peace with the fact that it's always going to be a part of me. Like some others, it's not my identity anymore though. Through therapy, I have learned to effectively challenge my ED-related thoughts and manage it. It doesn't control me and it doesn't make my life a constant battle. Will I ever go back to how my life was before I had this disorder? No, certainly not, but am I happy with my life? Yes.",phebe_want,1583606854.0,2020-03-07 12:47:34,"Hey.
So I’ve been ‘fully recovered’ for 2 years now and I’m still the same weight (a bit heavier) when I was classified as ‘weight restored’, but I still have a huge fear of food. I’m always trying to eat less when I can, but it’s hard because I’m a competitive athlete and I have to fit into a weight category. 
I don’t really know if I can give you any advice, because I’m having the same problem. I just want you to know that you’re not alone in this. I still don’t think I’m fully recovered, and still classify myself as anorexic.

Try to focus on why you want people to look at you and be scared. Or why you don’t think your worthy of that attention on your own without scaring people. It’s good you are recognizing this, and Id recommend diving deeper into that feel to sort it out. And I can offer a little bit of the experience I went through. 

Gaining weight was scary. From what I went through and from what I’ve seen other people go through, it can be dispersed awkwardly at first. But it settled more naturally after a bit. And during the awkward weight gaining time ya know what I learned? Not much changed. My friends and family still loved me. I was still the same person. Only I could be more of that person / friend / daughter / sister because I wasn’t spending all my time focused on food and exhausted. Especially adding fat back into my diet made me feel a lot better over time. At first I gained weight more in my stomach. But now my stomach is still flat only in a healthy way and now that I’ve been eating right for a bit I can see that it does look better. Also I’m quite jealous you gain weight in your thighs. People get plastic surgery now a days to have a smaller waist and bigger butt and thighs. Own it gal! But something that did really help me during recovery was I started lifting weights. I never got huge muscles, girls have to work crazy hard and purposefully to get that. But it did help to want to eat food when I knew it was going to fuel my muscles instead of fat. I don’t work out as much know and have stayed thin but I do miss being strong. So id give that go, helps a lot with your mood too! And we all need a mood boost during recovery. I say weight lifting over cardio because with cardio I could only focus on the calories lost. With weights I wanted to focus on calories in to fuel my workouts. 

You have a lot more to offer the world than to be super skinny. You deserve a place on this world without feeling like you need to shrink yourself smaller than your healthiest and happiest weight. You may be feeling like this feeling is a set back, but recovery comes with a lot of ups and downs. You are still much better off than when you started since a big part of you wants to recover.

I've never been rail thin or anorexic, but used to be a little slimmer than I am now, as recently as like 2 weeks. I'm afraid of me gaining weight becoming out of control and the idea of becoming legitimately fat scares the shit out of me. I've never had a flat stomach, and came to the realization I probably never will, because strict dieting and frequent exercise never made my tummy go away.. I think my flesh is just built this way and all I want in the world is to accept myself and not put all my worth and importance into a number on the scale or pants size or if my shorts fit somewhat tighter than they used to when I was still starving myself.

A major component of eating disorders is not being able to see and assess your body accurately. Body dysmorphia can manifest itself in many different ways, and what you're describing is definitely within those bounds.

I went through the same thing when I started my own recovery, when I felt like eating normally was just causing me to pack on fat. There was such negative self-talk about any kind of weight gain, much like you. I also had this sense of superiority over other people when I ate less than them, didn't get excited about food like them, and was super judgmental about people who were getting excited about a 'bad' food. My anorexic body was a symbol of pride in. It's all totally false though, and it hurt me so much.

I made a lot of peace with gaining weight and seeing it as a positive thing. I turned that negative self-talk into acceptance and positivity about myself other than body image. It took a lot of work, a lot of time, and a lot of sessions in therapy to convince myself that I'm okay. To this day, I still struggle some with weight fluctuations, but I know that because I have this disorder, I cannot assess my own body shape accurately, nor see it, no matter what shape it is, as a healthy part of being a human. It's still scary, but I accept that I feel this way in a sense. I accept that it's only a small part of who I am now.",13thConfession,1583275683.0,2020-03-03 16:48:03,"Great advice in the comments, as usual.

I'm sorry you're going through this. It is really, truly difficult.

One thing I try to remind myself is that, no matter how you spin it, you will not be able to sustain an eating disorder forever. Sooner or later, you'll either shift to a different eating disorder, die from the eating disorder or recover.

What happens to most people I think is, a certain level of desperation is reached and recovery is sought out. You start gaining weight, freak out and run back to restricting or purging, or whatever your behavior(s) are. Living this way is hellish, especially after experiencing a period of nourishment and rest, so you go back to trying to gain weight and recover. Gain weight, freak out, backslide etc etc. Some people, I feel like the majority of people, get stuck in this loop for years and years and years.

I think what finally pushes a lot of people to break the cycle permanently and finally gain the real weight is just utter exhaustion. Like, they just can't care anymore. I think life really opens up to people when they truly recover and they realize the world doesn't end. They often wish they'd recovered fully years ago!

Recovering fully from an eating disorder is one of the hardest things a person can do. There is SO MUCH stacked against you. And honestly I don't think there's enough accessible support for most people who suffer from them.

I don't know, I can't say I haven't gone up and down one thousand times in my journey, but I've finally accepted that it's just not worth it anymore. I don't want to wake up one day and realize my entire life has passed me by. And honestly? Your WORST fears about a recovery outcome are probably totally exaggerated and fueled by the ED. IT CAN BE OKAY. YOU CAN BE OKAY.

Imagine if you got diagnosed with cancer. Would you still try to lose weight? Or keep yourself at a lower weight? You'd probably focus on the things that matter, like your friends and family and passions.

Eating disorders are as destructive as cancer, they're just much much slower and you can live with the illusion that you're okay.

Even now (not so much admittedly) I would avoid social situations with food involved due to the anxiety it gave me unless I was really comfortable with the people I was with.
I've had hypnotherapy which certainly helped with the anxiety side of things before even the suggestion of me trying new foods would freak me out!
Even now at 25 I'm scared of trying new foods but have gotten a lot better, now the anxiety isn't so intense, to try different foods. Textures are a huge thing for me so even if I like the taste of a food but the texture is abnormal to me I likely won't try that food again.
I know this was exactly information but hopefully my experience will help you have a better understanding than you did before.

One thing my therapist said to me is people with AFRIDS tend to have 'safe foods' that they stick to, that they no are okay and nothing bad will happen when eating them, so part of the fear/anxiety around trying new foods can be the unknown of how you will react x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I KNOW it, even if that’s body dysmorphia talking and I am average weight and totally healthy looking. It triggers binge eating for me, which I then purge or have the massive urge to purge.

The things that make me feel better and not focused on my body are achievements or joys in life that have nothing to do with food at all, even small ones. Cleaning the house, spending quiet time at home finishing a nice book, passing a level on a video game, finishing a work project. And special treats that have nothing to do with food or eating, like trips to the beach, visiting a petting zoo or animal shelter, a concert, a trip to the park, a massage in bed, a sweet love note, etc. 

For example I felt so loved today when my boyfriend came over while I was still asleep and woke me up with new flowers - potted ones, because cut flowers wilt too quickly and he wanted these to be pretty for a long time.

They just have different ""diagnosis"" names for insurance billing purposes and continuation of care to make it easier for new professionals to get a quick idea of someone's symptoms. 

That's all any diagnosis names are for.  It's not some magic label that puts you in a box of sick,  sicker, less sick, etc.

If you were already on the waiting list they'll likely still admit you. I've done most of my treatments at healthy weights and even high weights for the disordered eating and not my body mass. A lot of medical knowledge and practices have changed over the years and there is less ignorance.

I would say try to talk to her as much as possible, but let her know that this may be triggering for you and maybe set some boundaries?

The fact that she has started talking to you is an absolutely great start, and I wish my sister was as open as yours.

As for the frustration, omg i cannot relate more. My mother (52F) is also showing ED symptoms, and it is so easy for us to get angry with each other accusing each other of eating less than the other.

I’m in recovery (and seeing a therapist) whilst she is losing weight and saying things like “omg I’m so full!!” after only having like 2 bites of dinner. It’s frustrating, I hate it, I’ve had to leave the room before because of it. And we used to cook &amp; eat together but I can’t anymore because it’s so triggering to eat like a whole bowl of pasta whilst she stops after a few bites. So basically I get what you’re saying and you’re totally valid. I’m sorry it’s gotten like this :/ 

 My first advice is to take a step back and don’t be involved in her recovery process. It sounds like you’re already doing that, which is great. She can reach out (hopefully) to other friends for help and support, and you aren’t in a place to help her because of your history and that’s FINE. Her actions will make you feel worse etc etc so it’s better just to stay out of it. You are not responsible for her recovery. I’d suggest for her to go to a therapist, but only when she’s ready to hear that of course. 

  I think the family holiday stuff is really tricky. Have you already said that you’ll go? I think you can come up with an excuse for it, like saying that you wanted to use the summer to go travelling with other friends or something (but then you actually have to follow that through otherwise it looks suspicious). It’s hard because you can tell your parents that you had a falling out or something, but then they will probably ask her about it. I think if you’re planning on avoiding her until she’s recovered anyway, then you can tell your sister that you don’t want to go on holiday because it’s triggering for you. And then maybe tell your parents a lighter version of the truth like “we had a fall out”. But I’d warn your sister that you’ll tell them an excuse like that, so then she doesn’t over react when she hears it from your parents. I know you said you don’t want to bring any attention to her disorder because she might react positively, but if she sees that she’s hurting someone dear to her( to the extent that you can’t be around her), then she might think twice about what she’s doing. We all know that this mental ill was destroys your life and your friendships and unfortunately this is just how it goes. It sounds harsh but we’ve all been there.

Because having an eating disorder means you have an unhealthy relationship to food. It doesn’t mean that only people who starve or binge and purge have eating disorders. Eating disorders take on many forms and it’s not a “one size fits all” sort of thing.

With recovery, I lifted, starting low, so the food would fuel my muscles. Would def recommend. And listen to your body when your hungry.

1593,faeawe,mylessandovaldpt,1582826266.0,2020-02-27 11:57:46,"Food-related guilt is one of the most common hurdles in recovery. However, it's not the food that creates our feelings; it's our internal beliefs. These belief-fueled feelings are why some people get road rage in traffic while others can chill out and listen to music in the car. We talk to ourselves all the time. Some people's internal dialogues are kind and encouraging. Some are mean. 

The beautiful thing is that beliefs can be changed, which ultimately change our feelings about food as well. We can also learn to sit quietly with guilt instead of allowing ourselves to be overwhelmed by it.

Often times there’s some need that’s being unfulfilled which we then translate into food guilt and shame. Instead of taking it out in our bodies, which we have learned to do for various reasons, we can take active steps to have our needs fulfilled. It’s a slow process but I feel it’s worth it.

Another thing that you can do more acutely is create a narrative around the guilt. Play out the scenario in your head (or write it down/record it)- what’s the worst thing that can happen now that you’ve eaten the food? It doesn’t matter how ridiculous the fear is, honestly the more ridiculous and honest the better. Then just read/replay it over and over until you are no longer feeling the guilt/anxiety/discomfort. When you start feeling bored by the narrative, that’s a good sign! I use narratives a lot in my OCD and ED treatment and I find them to be the best skill I’ve developed so far in dealing with acute crises.

It’s all only because if your thoughts about what has happened. The mind thinks compulsively to find some explanation, relief, escape, hope… This will get you nowhere because all that tension becomes your triggers, the less acceptance you have, the more triggers and cravings you’ll get. Whatever relief you get by thinking compulsively, will backfire against you later.

So if you are guilty, you need to stay as you are, don’t seek to resolve anything. Stay with the fact. Those are just emotions, every emotion is temporary, if you’re unaware, they renew themselves. If you felt nothing about whatever, you would not have a problem. So it seems that you’re a binge eater, you love X type of high-calorie food, you never have enough… Those are all feeling that come about the way I told you. Through a lack of acceptance and living in compulsive thought processes, you cannot see how it fluctuates. If you saw it, you will no longer fear binge eating.

Every emotion that comes out, it goes out, so don’t give it attention through overthinking. If you do that you lose awareness, thus they persist.

1595,faa2n1,lwaikart,1582805429.0,2020-02-27 06:10:29,"What you're doing is a form of ""body checking"" and is linked with both eating disorders and to some extent anxiety. You say you're not anorexic/bulimic, but much of what you describe sounds very disordered (obsession with weight/food, distress related to food/weight, excessive body checking, weight loss \[you didn't mention if it was unintentional\] a desire to see more bones, etc.), regardless of what the number on the scale says. 

I used to weigh myself excessively too. Sometimes it was out of curiosity (""I haven't eaten anything in X hrs, has my weight changed yet? No? What if I go pee? NOW has it gone down?""), but more often it was a way to control how I felt. If the scale reported something positive, then I'd be calmed and I could continue on my day. If it was not what I wanted, then I had to focus and obsess on ways to make it change.

Imagine that the weighing is a dysfunctional way of managing your emotions. You logically know your weight hasn't done anything. But emotionally, there's something happening that feels so intense you're compelled to do something about it (almost like an addiction). Explore that. 

What are you worried will happen if you don't weigh yourself? Also, the treatment/fix for compulsive behaviors like that is to take away the opportunity to do the behavior. Ie, get rid of the scale. And then get a therapist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m an ED clinician and I do work with men - I think the statistics are 1 in 4 people with EDs are males, however that’s only diagnosed and my guess is that there are more that are not diagnosed due to stigma. Very few of my clients fit the stereotypical “look” of an eating disorder. 

I know you hate your body right now and it might not seem like a concern, but restrictive eating disorders can have the same life-threatening effects on your organs regardless of weight. There are people who end up hospitalized with organ failure despite remaining in an “overweight” or “obese” body - all because they are eating so little. I would really encourage you to talk with a professional about what’s going on because it’s not going to be so simple to stop once your body is smaller. 

I have a male client right now with a similar story - at least similar in that he started restricting in a larger body. Despite being currently underweight he still views himself the same way he did when he was larger and it is an every day battle to eat. You deserve more than that.

It was all too much for me to handle at once. I got kicked out of rehab because I stopped eating completely and I was considered a liability. Luckily they didnt find out about the self harm.

I didn't realise that restricting could be a bad thing when you're overweight, I thought the fat is all the food you neef? Are the organ failures due to nutritional deficiencies?

I don't think I'll have a problem stopping when I'm a healthy weight, I don't want to be super skinny.. but I guess I have to be careful it doesn't become an obsession",invisiblepourlesyeux,1582895552.0,2020-02-28 07:12:32,"I’m glad that I can help you feel less alone. When I was in college and struggling with my own ED, the only friends I had talk to me about their own struggles were both male. And neither ever got treatment so they aren’t part of that 1 in 4 statistic. 

There are lots of different reasons that can cause hospitalization or death - it can be liver failure due to the rapid weight loss, it can be organ breakdown from protein deficiency, or electrolyte imbalances leading to cardiac failure. I know it doesn’t feel like you’ll have trouble stopping now, but obsession with food is a byproduct of starvation. 

There’s a study known as the Minnesota Starvation Experiment where they took healthy men (screened for both physical and psychological health) and put them on a calorie restricted diet (I think 1500 calories). They all started showing a lot of the physical and psychological symptoms we see in EDs - obsession with food, food hiding, recipe hoarding, irritability, poor judgement and poor concentration,,
 depression, decreased energy, poor temperature regulation. And this is only 1500 calories! I don’t know any of my clients who come to me eating even that much. 

There’s this phenomena I see with my clients where after they are eating enough or once they hit a certain weight it’s like their brain just “clicks” out of the obsession. And it’s a pretty stark difference. I’ve heard so many people say that they’ll stop at a certain weight/size/whatever but it never ends up being enough. I was one of those people - just didn’t want to be fat anymore and ended up with a 10 year eating disorder (that still pops up in my brain sometimes after almost 10 years of recovery).

Another study you might find of interest is the biggest loser study - they followed participants after the show and not only did most (if not all?) of them regain the weight, but despite weight regain they continued to have metabolic suppression of 500 calories a day. Despite being fat again, their metabolism was burning 500 fewer calories than it was before. And their fat mass / lean mass ratio ended up significantly worse. 

I know it is so hard when weight loss is supposed to be this magic cure everybody should be pursuing, but I don’t know that this approach is going to get you where you want to be. I hope you’ll consider talking to someone, or if nothing else at least eating a bit more. Because I hate for this to be the next 20 years of your life.

When I'd talk to a friend about it, they would say that it's good because I was so fat anyway, so I believed them and simply stopped eating and didn't even think there was a problem with it. My family forced me to to the gp, who did not focus on the fact that I was overweight and that losing the weight would probably ""do me some good"". She focused on WHY I wanted to lose weight, and a lot of my reasons were the exact same as yours. But I wasn't able to stop  myself because I was so obsessed with the idea of 'I'll stop once I get to a healthy weight'.
