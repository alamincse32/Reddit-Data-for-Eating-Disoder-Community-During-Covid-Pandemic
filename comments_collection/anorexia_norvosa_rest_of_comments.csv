Yeah, it gets worse.
Unless you start working on yourself.
I can't really give you any advice, but I can share my own story that started exactly like yours.
Basically all I wanted was to feel great in my own body, so losing some pounds seemed like a great idea. First, I cut out sugar. Then fats. Then carbs. Etc. Basically I started restricting myself more and more.  Even started working out twice a day. Yeah, I got the results- I was thinner, got compliments, but also I had no more energy, my hair was falling out, from missing my period to losing it. 
But then comes the day, when your body gets really sick, it wants to end this war. So now you have to choose- to get better or to get buried. I chose the first option. Yeah, it's good to feel alive, but you know what- to feel this way, I had to start eating again. But when your body have been on a starvation mode for don't know how long, you'll definitely going to gain weight. Maybe you'll going to weigh even more than right now. Well, I do. I weigh about 20lbs more now and have lost my self-confident entirely. I have stretch marks all over my body- my stomach, my legs, my arms.  Yeah, I'm slowly starting to love myself again, but it takes time... a lot of time. 

So think about it. Be proud of what you have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I noticed is that when I gain weight is when I typically feel terrible. I used to get migraines all the time when I was 115-119 lbs— and headaches everyday at school. I also would get dizzy, and I was considered healthy. 
It wasn’t until I got to 90 that I really felt good. No migrantes, a headache once in a blue moon and never feeling dizzy. The only thing was hunger pangs and stomach bleeding— which is terrible on its own. It seems like i can’t escape health issues no matter what weight I am. 

I asked my mom for therapy at age 17 and was told no and that I needed to just go on antidepressants. My doctors since I’m on free healthcare do not take mental illness serious. I went in at the age of 5 with my mom demanding I be diagnosed with some behavioral disorder and with then disapproving. Then at the age of 16 with a plea to label me with ADHD. Then at the age of 17 with anorexia— and still the doctors were unmoved. Now I’m 18 and i have no way of getting to the doctor without my mom and she’s not in my life at the moment. I just got my license but have no car to go to frequent therapy sessions as well— so there is that road block. Right now I am just going to university full time via a 2 hr city bus ride.

I just feel so full compared to my aunt— I tried to talk to her about it but she is mindless and doesn’t take me seriously she throws away my questions like they are nothing. The other day I was complaining about how I hate clothing stores because everything fits me tight and she turns to me and says “I am so tired of you saying you hate things. It’s bringing me down.”

It’s always about her, although I always make it a big deal to be involved in helping her through everything— she makes me feel like I am a waste of space and shouldn’t talk. ",Bot_Metric,1546117199.0,2018-12-29 14:59:59,"119.0 lbs ≈ 54.0 kilograms ^(1 pound ≈ 0.45kg)

50,a8o191,obviouslynotjackie,1545519144.0,2018-12-22 16:52:24,"First off, you can’t damage your metabolism. The lighter you are,the less calories you burn and the less calories are required to maintain that weight. The reason you gained more was because your body was used to running on that certain amount of calories and when you began to eat more, you obviously gained some water and actual weight. I don’t want this to come across as rude or w.e, I’m just tryna spread some truth :) 

As for your actual post, please don’t do it :( There are so many health problems that come with this, you don’t just die quickly. It’s a slow and painful death, emotionally and physically. I urge you to consult with a therapist or someone you trust that can help with these thoughts, someone you can immediately rush to when these thoughts seem never ending. I know it’s easier said than done but honestly, I’m going to a  birthday party soon and all I did was exercise two hours beforehand and now all I’m thinking about is how caloric the food will be and if I look thin enough in my outfit. :( please don’t fall back into the shitty rabbit hole if you can :( ❤️",emmaememma,1545542649.0,2018-12-22 23:24:09,It is not uncommon to regain more weight than when u started as restriction does slow down your metabolism and your body does lose trust in you when you starve yourself so it ramps up your appetite and tries to make you binge because it doesn’t know when it will get fed again. You can’t permanently damage your metabolism though. It can take a while to restore it though so if you have now managed to normalise things I would definitely do everything possible to stop yourself going back down that pathway. Anorexia is a serious disease though so if you can’t do it alone I would get help. It is not a life and will only bring you more pain. Relapse is very common so if you have a background of an eating disorder it is very normal to get these urges even if you think you have recovered. You have to be on high alert and make sure if you actually begin to act on these urges you seek help immediately as we both know the further down that hole you go the harder it is to get out. Many ‘recovered’ individuals say that the thoughts are still there it is just about turning down the volume on them.!,IBAPanda1,1545573790.0,2018-12-23 08:03:10,Thank you for your support I'm going to confide in my sister for support.

At my worst, I actually thought ""Well, I am very very thin and skinny, and I am still very valuable"" (A sense of vanity and narcissism). 
I was so engulfed in it that I didn't give a fuck about what others would say, my world was counting calories, thinking about next meal, coming up with ways to make my meals appear bigger to supress appetite as well as drinking diet coke, and exercising and walking everything off. 
I didn't have time to think about being valuable, bcause at that point you're stripped off of any sanity left as you're starving. I was starving and I thought I was gorgeous and valuable. The next moment I hated myself. There was nothing consistent, brain didn't function. It really is a mental illness and it has nothing to do with other's weight in essence.

Some artificial sweeteners can potentially alter your insulin sensitivity which could increase fat storage too. They are never going to cause you to gain as much as drinking normal soda though. Another major concern is the damage to. Tour tooth enamel especially if it is cola based.

I eat based on my mood; if it's a good day, then I'll eat til I'm full. If it's a rough day, I'll probably put off eating because I'd rather indulge an impulse like playing Xbox or wasting time on my phone/laptop. If it's a really bad day, I won't think about food at all and won't even contemplate preparing or going to get any; my diet is non-existent and I couldn't even put together the sequence of tasks necessary to make a sandwich when I am like this. 

I understand how difficult eating can be for my girlfriend and so I do what I can to assure her, that how much she eats has no impact on how much I love her, how beautiful I think she is, etc. I tell her that enjoying great food with her is one of my favorite things, I never pay attention to how much or how fast she eats.

I am so sorry that you feel that way, but I completely understand what you're going through. I never thought that I would get to a place where I felt fully comfortable with myself naked in front of someone else, especially someone I love. I'm not saying that it's easy to become comfortable, but I just know (from personal experiences) a lot of the things you probably find ""gross"" about yourself, they aren't seeing at all.

We're so much more critical about ourselves than other people ever could be. I look at a huge pimple on my face and tell myself that everyone will notice it, but chances are, no one is going to care let alone notice.

Being intimate with someone also equals being vulnerable, which can be super hard, and even harder with already having body issues. But the more comfortable you become with that person, the easier it gets because you realize that they love you for you. 

You are perfect just the way you are.

My journey into anorexia was exactly like yours: sligtly overweight -&gt; starts a diet -&gt; gets skinnier and skinnier and just doesnt stop. I would say the only way to break the cicle for your right here and now it to force feed yourself. Let me tell you: anorexia is not worth it! It takes away you social live, your health (I got liver damage, metablolism damage, currently no sex drive, ect.) and the ocd only gets worse over time.

I think you are not headed for anorexia but already are suffering from it - anorexia does not require you to be underweight. The fear of gaining weight and fear of food is a huge indicator for this. 

I can tell you from my experience that maintaining a lower bodeyweight is not worth the anorexia that comes with it. I know it sounds corny but learn to love your bodey - no matter the size.

Also this disease doesn’t promote healthy skin or hair or anything. It literally kills you from the inside out and it shows. 

In my experience when I was at my worst I was doing it because I couldn’t deal with the other stuff in my life. And anorexia became an obsession. I legitimately loved all the attention I got BUT I was miserable. You’ll never be thin enough, this disease will take over your every thought and your life. 

I’m 29 now and doing well. It’s something I still struggle with and think about but I’ve totally recovered. My BMI is healthy and I don’t starve or workout every second I get like I use to.

108,at3xnn,emmaememma,1550761742.0,2019-02-21 09:09:02,Body image problems are the last thing to go in recovery so you are not alone. Just try and remind yourself that most people don’t like their bodies. You absolutely should not try and lose weight because this will 100 % send you back down a disordered path. Try and remind yourself that ultimately people don’t care what you look like they only care how you make them feel and it is pretty hard to be a likeable person when you are in the throes of an eating disorder. Why do you want the perfect body ? What do you think it will bring to your life ? Perfection is subjective anyway so some people would view your body as perfect now even if you do not see it that way. Keep working with your therapist with regards to this. Unfortunately the only way for it to improve is with time and hard work.,Kallusho-,1550851945.0,2019-02-22 10:12:25,"Hi, 

I think you’re totally right, the only thing is, in my case for example, I think I don’t care what other people can think about me and my body, but still I’m in the exact same situation as azulawula because it is my vision of myself that is wrong, I hate my body and not because of the looks that I may fear some people has on me... and it is hard because I don’t know how to love my body or at least how to accept it :/",emmaememma,1550853460.0,2019-02-22 10:37:40,You don’t have to love it just appreciate what it allows you to do. Ultimately the body is just a vessel that allows us to exist. Try and be thankful for the fact that it still functions even though your mind tried to destroy it. Try and focus more on external factors and others rather than looking at yourself. It is much easier said than done obviously so keep working with your therapist. Do you really think you would hate your body though if you lived in complete isolation and had nothing to compare it to ? You may think that you don’t really care what people think but I think we all subconsciously want to be loved and accepted and the illusion of a perfect body is something we think will help us get there. It is ironic though as an eating disorder actually makes you more unloveable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Are you on any medications ? When you are starving your body is in survival mode so sex is not exactly a priority. It is hard to say. They also say that one’s emotional intelligence halts when you develop anorexia and will only pick up when you fully recover.

Comparisons really fuck you up as well. But yeah I 100% believe that eating disorders in general heavily coincide with the environmental factors that a person is exposed to as well as how they let it effect them. For example, surrounding yourself with enablers (like other people with eating disorders) is only going to encourage the behaviors bc it normalizes it / sparks competition in a way. Like you see a picture of a girl who you might think is thinner than you (like thinspo) and in turn you “skip dinner,  to wake up thinner” (see what I did there lmao) in an attempt to emulate her appearance/ aesthetic.

I doubt you are retaining 40 pounds of water but you could easily be retaining 11 pounds. I am not sure if you are inpatient or outpatient but if you haven’t had bloods done recently maybe get them checked. When you are malnourished your body does all sorts of weird things. It will probably take at least of year of adequate nutrition and regular meals for your metabolism and weight to normalise and your body to trust you gain. It is not uncommon to accumulate weight around your midsection during recovery but this sorts itself out later. Well done on starting the journey. It isn’t easy so I have a lot of respect for you.

Allow me to clarify something super quick:

I don't eat much while with my mom because she does not make me feel safe or comfortable anymore. The food that she has is ekther horribly fattening or I have allergies to it. She wanted me to be overweight like the rest of my family, but used to scold me for it. When I lost weight the first round about she thought I was underweight (which I was not I was just at a HEALTHY weight rather than being overweight (which she thought was okay). 

My boyfriend, on the other hand, makes me feel safe. Sane. Beautiful and confident. The foods he has are yummy AND healthy, and he helps me with working out (and physical therapy things because I have a connective tissue disorder).

My UGW will stay the same as it has since I was 7 - I know my bone structure / body frame would NOT look good all bony, and in the years I've had an ED I've not had any body dysmorphia or disphoria (idr which one it was lol). The only thing I have is a fear of gaining weight and thats just ""I dont wanna weigh this much ever again"" or ""I cannot gain thid amount or that'll put me at this weight."" What I have done in the past would also apply, but currently what I do is considered normal dieting.

I know that I am valid in my feelings, and I know that the thoughts and feelings I have towards food and my weight will always be with me, but I know it does not define me. I know that my slumps will always come to an end, and that I am strong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As others have said, the most important thing you can do is encourage her to get professional help (if she hasn’t already). In your interactions with her, take the focus off of food/body image, and instead reinforce and comment on other aspects of her that you love. For instance, if she is kind, comment on the *specific*, kind actions she takes (eg, “I loved when you said X to so-and-so today; I’m sure that made him feel so good about himself”). Sometimes “being thin” feels like the only good thing about us, so it’s nice when people remind us that we’re more than that. Finally, I’d recommend avoiding statements like, “you look so much healthier,” when she’s recovering. “Healthy” often equates to: “I can tell you’ve gained weight,” in our minds.

They would say awful things about my weight. This was when I was 11 or 12. I was in 7th grade 
I remember every night crying in the shower, it got as far as me getting a kitchen knife when my parents weren’t home  and trying to cut them off.i was depressed and so unhappy. 

In 8th grade I got in track and lost about most of my weight, I got so skinny everybody was very surprised. Freshman year the people who made fun of me would look at me very weird. They started saying I was anorexic and I started believing it,

 i think being anorexic isn’t about not eating it’s about being unhappy with the body

I remember sophomore year a girl in class told me I was so skinny and I told her no that I was fat.  And I started to figure out that although I was skinny I didn’t feel skinny, I didn’t see myself as being skinny. I still felt like a fat loser kid in middle school. She then told me there was something wrong with me.
All through high school I suffered from not eating I would only drink coffee. 

Now I’m in college and I gained weight and I’m so traumatized I want to die I NEED to lose weight and lose chest fat.

If you just stop eating right now your body will attack your muscle first instead of fat and because you're heavier it will be a lot harder to move around at the end of it. Even if you don't want to eat, try to get protein in your body, it helps to keep your body from going after muscle. Fasting sounds exciting but it honestly just messes with your metabolism and in the end you'll gain more back than you lose.

If you have anorexia there is probably nothing I can tell you to make you fear weight gain any less but it will definitely be required for full recovery.

My childhood best friend is critically ill. She has tried it all. I won’t make the call for her to go to the hospital, but have made myself available to go with her should she choose to. 

What I like about this article is that it mentions the starving brain. It isn’t a perspective I’ve considered. Everyone is quick to jump to “just eat,” and we all know it is much more nuanced than that. I imagine most of the people here would like to conquer their ED, and I think this perspective might help. Your brain is not working the way it would were you eating in a healthy way. Maybe this could be a tool to soften the self-sabotage that comes with increasing calories. Remind yourself that your thoughts will begin to change. The torment is temporary, and recovery means regaining control of your life.

One thing that really helped me was to watch movies with women who aren't super skinny. I loved seeing these actresses with curves and loved watching them in various movies. These women became my inspiration to accept my new body. I wish you all the best on this journey.

 Every time I stand up, I hit the ground.

I haven't had a single day without a headache in YEARS.

I can't work anymore because I don't have the energy, I don't have the energy to do ANYTHING.

Tomorrow I have to go to the doctor to find out if my heart is failing because my chest is hurting constantly, I’m so cold and numb all the time, and climbing just one flight of stairs leaves me out of breath. In high school I played varsity softball. 

The emotions your experiencing where you recognize the unhealthy behaviors, know you should stop, but simply... don’t want to, and can’t come up with a justifiable reason, are actually part of anorexia itself. The “honeymoon” phase is still calling to you, and the quick fixes anorexia offers still seem appealing. 

The fact that you were able to ask for help is in itself a huge step in the right direction for your health, and in larger terms, for your life. You recognized this early, which is the best possible way to ensure you don’t permanently damage your body. I encourage you to talk to someone you trust like a counselor or a doctor and tell them about these concerns, and ask them for resources on how to maintain a healthy weight and nutrient rich diet while resisting the urge to starve yourself. 

I know it’s easy to not eat, and it’s hard to convince that inner voice that you need to. Please don’t ignore these warning signs, because by the time you can’t ignore them any longer it’s already too late to make a complete recovery, your body will never be the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I can say is maybe add in some habits that will at least relieve your stress and help you become healthy. Don't focus on being thin. Focus on accepting your body for being how it is while also knowing that you need to be healthy. 

However, my doctor has actually said I need to lose weight. If you gained 40 lbs and are fine, you don't need to focus on losing anything at all.

I wish I had the guts to talk about it like you do, so that someone could have told me to get help then, before I destroyed my life like I have.

Don’t be afraid to talk about what you’re going through. Having disordered thoughts doesn’t make you a bad person, but those thoughts are just that - disordered. They’re not ok and they need to be addressed. Better to do it now before those thoughts have taken everything from you.

When you’re feeling a binge, chug a diet soda or water, eat some ice cubes, distract yourself, and if you need to eat (which is sometimes the case) eat high density low calorie foods (like fruits and veggies) you can/will never completely stop binging (most likely) so you have to compromise and remember that you can only push yourself so far.

Reflecting on it, I’ve struggled with my ED since middle school. 6th grade is the earliest I can remember having ED-related thoughts (desperate desire to look thinner, guilt about eating.) 7th grade I got really tall but hardly gained weight; the nurse was shocked by it and that’s when the rewarding and obsessive ideas of weight loss really took off for me. Shortly after, I was fad dieting and by high school sophomore year, I was going through starvation periods followed by restrictive calorie intake.

I was in a rocky recovery about a year ago where I was eating more regularly but my mental state was still pretty bad, so I didn’t feel good about myself and easily fell back into bad habits. I was sorta yo-yo recovering for a while then hit a really bad relapse in winter than didn’t end till recently. This is the first time now that I feel better about both eating AND my body. In the past, it’s been one or the other.

I credit “safe foods” and focus on muscle definition as the most helpful factors in my recovery. I focus on macros more so than calories and eat healthy, clean food. Focusing more on the nutritional value of food makes me feel less guilty eating it. I’ve also been doing less cardio and focusing on muscle building. I’m finally seeing the results of it and looking in the mirror last night, I felt *sexy*. I didn’t give a fuck what the scale said at that moment. It felt surreal.

Oh and most importantly, I’m staying the hell away from the scale. During my first “recovery,” I checked the scale almost every single day. Last night, I stepped on it for the first time in a while and regretted it. It’s easier said than done, but focus on how you’re feeling about yourself, not on the numbers the scale shows you. Especially with muscle definition. Muscle weighs more than fat.

Sorry this wound up being so long, but I hope it’s helpful in any way! Best of luck to you and sending you my hope.",prvtacct212131443,1560349867.0,2019-06-12 09:31:07,Thank you so much!

However once it starts to get really dangerous talk to her about it.",sparkle-g,1561386380.0,2019-06-24 09:26:20,"I’ve been in many relationships, and I’ve had anorexia for a long portion of them all because of some bad issues. 

First, she has BPD. I can’t give medical advice, but even people without mental illness love support. Support, support, support. Remind her that she’s loved, you want to make her feel safe, you like her no matter how she looks, you’ll help her in any way you know how (she may open up more if she hears that), etc. 

I’m going to be brutally honest. Anorexia can’t be cured with you, or anybody she knows. Even if you beat it by yourself, the tendencies don’t quite disappear and they risk coming back. I just relapsed after 2 years. Forcing her to eat will only make it explode because of the insecurity, and chances are she KNOWS she is skinny but she can’t see it herself because of the dysphoria. 

You should try to get her some professional help. Say you’re worried because she’s losing a lot of weight, and you know it might be scary but you want her to be healthy and happy and if she’s fine with her weight and not worried about food and likes herself, she will be okay, which is what therapy can do. 

I’m really sorry you’re both going through this. Her parents have probably noticed and might be on board with therapy if she’s underage and needs them to pay for it. For most of the people I knew or know with this, it eventually lessens, but it has a risk of coming back. It’s better to get professional help and squish both of those more than she could alone.",abcdefgh1zwei,1561416983.0,2019-06-24 17:56:23,Thank you so much! It’s been really tough.

Since they always round calories to 5’s and 0’s, the number you calculate from the macros will be close but not the same.

If the package shows macronutrients, find the grams of carbs, fats, and proteins.
There’s 4 calories in a gram of carbs, 4 in a gram of protein, and 9 in a gram of fat. To find the closest accurate calories, just multiply those and add them together.

For example, if a serving of something has 10 g carbs, 2 g protein, and 1 g fat, 
10 x 4 cal/g carbs = 40
2 x 4 cal/g protein = 8
1 x 9 cal/g fat = 9

40+8+9=57

The thing that sucked the most about it wasn't the pain, though. It was the fact I knew why it was happening. I'd had a setback and after relapsing, eating enough for a couple of days, and then going back - my brain was extremely stressed out. 

I went home that night crying my eyes out. I wrote in my journal (I have an entirely filled out journal documenting my personal anorexia experience) that I didn't understand what the point of this all was. I was fucking exhausted and depressed and was sick of doing this to myself.

Quit smoking first. When I was smoking, my appetite which was already pretty low just became non-existent. Gaining weight while smoking honestly just wasn’t a possibility. Throw away the packs, ask your family/friends to throw out your pack if they catch you smoking, find people you can lean on and help you kick it. It’s really hard but it’s really also nice being able to breath again and not having to think about when you can next smoke and if you need to buy more or if you smell, etc. Super liberating.

Eating is going to start coming back but if you’re dealing with AN you’re going to have to push yourself and not necessarily wait for the hunger cues to come back because they will be all wonky. Eat. Eat what you want, what you crave, ... You’ve been deprived for what I can assume is a long time and your body needs everything you’re going to give it. You might gain a lot of weight instantly but it’s because of bloating, water retention,... If you know you can avoid scales and trust yourself enough to know you are gaining weight then it’s best to just not think of how much you weigh. If you don’t already have a therapist and nutritionist I think you should seriously consider it.

If you eat consistently (3 meals 3 snacks a day) your hunger cues should come back. You weight will consistently come back on and your body will decide where it is naturally comfortable.

When a person’s body is malnourished, such as during an eating disorder, the protein stores in their body become depleted. When this occurs, the body has to make sure that it takes care of essential functions (such as organ function and retaining muscle tissue) above all else. Our hair, which is made up of a protein called keratin, is not as essential to our body’s functioning. So, hair growth stops so the body can focus on keeping that person alive. Depending on a person’s age, genetic makeup, and other developmental factors, regular hair growth will most likely return to normal after a person maintains nutritional stabilization for six months or more.

Remember that two plates of food - even two “big” plates as you said - is perfectly fine and normal to do every now and then! One meal like that doesn’t have much of an effect on anything at all. It’s impossible to gain weight from one meal, other than the weight of the food itself which will pass. Don’t let yourself compensate with restricting or purging in any way. If you’re feeling a little bloated, next time you eat, try eating something high in fiber and drink plenty of water to help keep your digestive system moving and help the bloating settle down. I feel like I’ve been “bad” when I’m bloated, that really triggers my guilt, and eating foods and staying hydrated to help get that bloat settled down always makes me feel better.

If you’re worried about money, a lot of therapy is covered by insurance and if not, many specialists are wonderful people who will work with you on payment and treat now/pay later. IMO, ED specialists are better than general therapists because therapists don’t always know how to deal with those with eating disorders. If you have any other questions ask!

There are people with eating disorders out there who desperately try to get someones attention and help by giving out some hints to have someone notice, without having to say it out loud.  
There are also people with eating disorders who are afraid anyone will notice because it would mean that they can't just binge or purge and starve without anyone watching everything they do, worrying or judging.  
It depends so much on the whole situation.  


Are you even sure it's an eating disorder? And specifically anorexia nervosa? There are some other (not only mental) illnesses that could cause weightloss, hairloss, etc. and maybe she's already diagnosed and in treatment and doesn't want to talk about it. Did you notice new behaviour? Has she always been losing weight?   


The problem is, there is no ""right way"" to approach it, because everyone handles it differently. There are just a lot of ""wrong ways"" to do it (like ""you need a burger"", ""only dogs play with bones"", ""men want real women with curves"", ""just eat""...), but since you've been through a lot yourself and since you're even thinking about HOW to approach the topic, I don't think that THAT's your problem.  


It's hard to give you proper advice without knowing her or you or your friendship. How close are you? How often do you hangout? Do you talk about private stuff? Have you ever talked about YOUR problems with alcohol with her? How did you do it? Did she approach that topic or you? Think about how she might have approached a sensitive topic to you. What did she do? How did she phrase it? Who talked to you about  your problems with alcohol in a way, that you didn't get defensive? How did they do it? How/in which situation/because of whom did you want to seek help?  


I can only speak for myself when I say this now, so I don't know if it would be right for her:  
My best friend (who also has or had problems with alcohol (and other substances) and I can't meet too often, because we're living in different cities. But a few weeks ago he texted me: ""Hey, I know that you're going through a lot and I know that you're not feeling well, but I wanted to remind you that I am always here for you if you need me. If you want to tell me anything, I'll listen and I won't judge you for anything.""  
Maybe when you're seeing her struggling with a situation that's connected with her disorder (f.e. eating lunch, feeling cold, passing out, feeling dizzy, shaking, anything related...) you could say something like that. Try not to say something specific about the eating or weight, maybe not even your worries. Just remind her, that you're there for her. That you'll listen and you won't judge. Don't expect her to open up in that moment. Give her a few days. Maybe she'll gather enough courage to talk to you on her own. You could also remind her, that you've been through a lot and that it was hard for you, but it helped you that she was there for you in that situation.

Keep it general at first.   
And keep in mind that you won't be able to fix her problem and that she won't suddenly say ""oof, yes, you're right, I'll look for a therapist"". She knows what she's doing. She knows that it could kill her. She knows everything about it, but it won't mean a thing until she wants to change it herself. You can't force anyone into recovery.  


If she doesn't accept your offer and doesn't talk about it on her own after a while, next time you see her alone and struggling, you could say something like:

""I noticed you struggling with \[insert specific behaviour or situation\]. You're one of my closest friends and I don't want you to believe that I'm blind to your discomfort/problems. If I can do anything for you, please let me know. You're not alone.""  


You said, that you would get super defensive when someone tried to confront you. Try to phrase everything you say in a way you wouldn't want to push yourself away or like you would feel trapped. It's so easy for us (and anyone with mental health problems) to push everyone away and isolate ourselves.",ibitemynailsalot,1564255512.0,2019-07-27 14:25:12,Maybe find out why she’s worried/issue is.

You need to talk to her parents, if you are concerned about your friend's health, you need to talk to someone about this. 

If her mother or father doesn't listen, you will need to escalate it to someone else. This self-harm, and you should treat it as such. 

I would not recommend confronting her or talking to her yourself, because... as evidence here on this sub, a lot of people know they have an ED, and do not want treatment. Further, she may withdraw from you (as many ED people do once others find out about their ED), so you need to make sure you are prepared for her being very upset at you if you move forward. 

If this is a school situation, reach out to a counselor or a trusted teacher.

It's important to remember that that's your eating disorder talking. Your eating disorder will make up every excuse possible to take over your mind, body and life. You have to fight back and try to separate the two voices. I know they're not literal voices but lines of thought I guess. I call my disordered thinking my eating disorder voice and say sometimes it's louder than others. 

Also, you can have an eating disorder and you can be harming your body even if you are not underweight.

You heat up the oil in a bowl, with the bowel inside of a pot of water on the stove. If it gets too hot itll really burn, so I'd recomend going for warm temp rather than actually hot. Then you use it to massage your scalp like you would with shampoo, and leave it in for as long as you can get away with- overnight with a towel on is a catalyst I think because of the heat. Rinse out with a LOT of shampoo, you may have to go twice, and when it dries your hair should feel softer but more importantly your scalp and hair follicles will have been stimulated and nourished which will help promote new hair growth and keep the hair you already have still there for as long as possible. 

I hope this helps, OP, or that something does. Hair loss is a real bitch and awful if you're already struggling with confidence of self esteem. ❤",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your brain (as it turns out!) is the number one part of your body that needs fuel in the form of blood sugar...or lacking that, ketones.

A lot of people hear someone venting or talking about a problem and automatically try and offer solutions. Just remember you’re not qualified to give her any kind of advice — listening to her and supporting her is enough. When she says something that disturbs or frightens you, think a little on it instead of automatically reacting. A lot of times, what we initially say to something is the worst thing to say. She has a mental illness, and it will twist seemingly innocuous comments into personal attacks and reflections on her failure as a person. Avoid comments about her body and how much she is/isn’t eating. You are probably confused and frightened, I recommend finding a therapist or a spiritual advisor who you can vent to. You need an outlet for the frustration and helplessness you will eventually feel, or else you will burn out. Good luck.

390,cu0vd3,RexieEllen,1566733389.0,2019-08-25 06:43:09,"I am mostly familiar with the starvation side of ED. I will tell you something that I have not admitted to anyone...I purged a few weeks ago for the first time. My bff got a job promotion and we celebrated by going to the Cheese Cake Factory. I did everything right. I fasted before the dinner. I didn't eat the bread. I stuck to water, but I binged and ate and ate. I don't know what your ED is like but I def relate to the anxiety part. I felt out of control and I had a panic attack and made myself puke it out. 

Since I've never done it before, it took me forever to get myself to gag. Then I was just gagging but nothing was coming up. I've vomited in the past before, but usually from alcohol poisoning. So I was weirded out how the food was coming up like baby food--all solid. I thought it . was going to be more liquid and burn from the acid in my stomach. I have been always told that bulimia is super dangerous because forcing yourself to vomit can burn a hole in your throat so I was confused when it didn't burn. Since my ED is so centered around control, I didn't like not . knowing when the food was all out. I also keep a food diary and when I have to estimate it gives me severe anxiety. I didn't like not knowing how much I threw up and how much I would have to adjust for that in my book. I just feel like starvation gives me that high of being in absolute control. Its like being proactive rather than being reactive. 

I also don't like the way it made me feel. I felt super weak and just gross all over. My shirt had vomit all over it and I got vomit in my hair. I just felt so gross and ashamed. It must be so hard to go through that on a daily basis! 

I know that for sure ED is a mindset and that it might never be enough. I was literally dying and I would have never gotten better if my parents hadn't stepped in. I'm not better but I'm not dead lol. Do you want to stop purging or are you conflicted...because vomiting is def not fine or do you mean fine as in like weight? 

For me, I didn't care how I was losing--just that I was. Enough wasn't ever going to be enough. I was never enough. I accepted I was going to die from my ED and I didn't give two shits. That is what I wanted, to be as empty as I felt. Now, I'm at a cross road. Why can't I restrict and lose weight if I'm not in danger anymore. Kind of what you were saying with your depression, if I'm not to that point, to the point where I used to be, why can't I edge up on it? Why can't I be just above being underweight? Borderline. If restricting helps me control my anxiety why should I demonize my coping mechanism? It's because its not sustainable or healthy. Plus, just as it helps my anxiety and depression it also fuels it. 

When I was at my lowest weight, it didn't matter what others told me, what the doctors told me, because I didn't/don't love myself. I still don't believe them when they tell me I'm underweight. In the very beginning, sure I was in denial. I told myself that this was normal and this is what it took to be healthy and people just didn't understand A type personalities. But in all honestly its just an extreme mindset. Its hard to break but not impossible, but if you truly want to recover--not for anyone else but yourself--then I recommend telling a trusted adult or counselor if not to recover but to just vent. Maybe as you start to open up to this person more, they can help you figure out healthier coping mechanisms that aren't as destructive. I'm not saying anorexia is better, but you could try it if you still want to lose weight and not feel so shitty. The effects are still dangerous I know, but I feel like its easier to maintain longterm. 

Instead of binging, try to set food goals for yourself to maintain and then work out for a rational amount of time. I also struggle with depression and working out gave me that dopamine/serotonin high and so I took the work outs to the extreme to amplify this good feeling. But again, it wasn't sustainable and after a year my body started to shut down and I was falling apart. Then that same high that I once got from that coping mechanism just kept changing and my anxiety worsened. Some days I would think that I was the shit and amazing for having the endurance to run 14 miles a day on empty and just above it, but other days I would feel like I was the fattest person on earth but the ED remained a constant. I thought that it was never going to get better that it always was going to be. Its still a big part of my life but its not so consuming. It really helped that I have people in the loop.  Sure, my parents give me crap and I go to Drs appts legit every week...but the new medications and therapy sessions are helping to uncover why I need the ED. You can also try drinking zero cal drinks to fill up on or eating very low cal foods like celery. Eventually, your stomach will shrink and you wont be hungry. You can try to cut down on servings when you fo eat so a binge will be like an actual serving of food. 

TLDR: The longer you prolong getting help, the worse your ED and recovering is going to get. Even if you get to your normal...your magic number...your ED chances as your view of yourself changes. 

I used to use Eugenia Cooney as my thinspo, but I told myself that I would never have an ED I'm just doing this drop a few to look good at prom, but now two years later and I'm still battling this ED. I told myself that I couldn't possibly get to her level of sick because how can let yourself get there....well I did and I honestly thought I was fine. 

I'm not suggesting you should recover! I'm just warning you that it's a slipper slope.",kirachang,1567033439.0,2019-08-28 18:03:59,"loose weight in a healthy manner. love your body. don’t stave yourself or purge to loose weight, eat healthy and exercise and sleep and in general take good care of yourself. it’s hard, but it’s entirely possible. and the best thing is when you’re finally happy with yourself-and healthy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've weight restored, yes, but that's only because I decided to numb my feelings with alcohol. I traded food for drugs for several years, but my ED never left my side, even when I drowned it out with drugs and alcohol.

I'm currently in the worst relapse I've ever been through, I'd go to treatment if I didn't have a job, my senior year of college, a boyfriend who's about to propose and get a house with me, and if my insurance actually covered it (my insurance doesn't cover ANY mental health costs) so... I'm stuck doing this on my own. And it's not easy. Fuck, it's so far from easy it isn't even funny. But I'm doing it for my bf, our future, MY future. 

If your insurance covers it, I suggest going to at LEAST IOP BUT, I get it, you already know the ins and outs of treatment, you know all the skills and everything that goes along with those skills, there's nothing more you can be taught. Once again, I'm in the same boat. So, if treatment is off the table, USE THOSE SKILLS.

Sure! Getting treatment in + scheduled is really quite difficult. Honestly being mentally ill sucks and they sure don't do you any favors lol.

Just don't let yourself believe you don't need help. EDs are really tricky, it's about balance (not abstinence), and of course you have to eat 3-6 times per day.

My first few months of recovery I was constantly hungry but I screwed up my digestion pretty badly so I couldn't really eat anything satisfying enough. I guess the best advice I can offer is to experiment with counting calories. Start off at a number you feel comfortable with, and slowly increase it until you get to a healthy number. If that doesn't work for you, set frequent intervals throughout the day for you to eat snacks. A cheese stick, an orange, some yogurt, whatever you like. I found that keeping my actual meals (breakfast lunch and dinner) small and eating snacks throughout the day made me feel more comfortable than just jumping straight to bigger portion sizes, but also helped me get more calories in throughout the day.

As Ram Das once said, “when you get the message hang up the phone.” 

It might take a couple experiences to help that perspective take root though. 

As I was writing this I just thought of a patient Dr Stan Grof saw back in the 50’s when clinical psychedelic psychotherapy was still legal. This patient suffered from erectile distinction so severe he remained a virgin into his 40’s. Through psychedelic therapy with a trained psychiatrist, he was able to recall the moment that started this condition which had previously been blocked in his subconscious. As a teenager he was with a girl in his car and at the moment they began to get physical a cop tapped on the window and scared the shit out of him. Since then he couldn’t be with a woman.

I’ve had a hella ride with them I’m on a journey it’s like a story and I’m on my last chapter now. I started with DMT which told me where I had to go (the jungle) but not why. Then I did the chapter with ayahuasca which was gruelling and showed me the sobering reality that my illness never went away and if I don’t deal with it it would kill me, but that I’m stronger than I know and I can do it. Psilocybin then helped me to understand the root cause and face up to it. Now I’m working with wachuma (mescaline) which is helping me with the self love and light that I need to get through this last part of the process. It’s definitely not for everyone and it’s certainly not the easy way (though it’s the fast route) but I think psychs have done wonders for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

450,d3glha,yellowposy2,1568335709.0,2019-09-12 19:48:29,"I totally understand the feeling of needing a totally fresh start, but change is more sustainable if you make small habit changes. I’d recommend finding some concrete goals, and then breaking those goals down into steps, and work towards them one step at a time. That can feel less overwhelming, and it ensures that you can track progress. Sending you love and support ❤️",superschuch,1568375942.0,2019-09-13 06:59:02,"If depression gives you trouble with motivation or follow-through, look into habit tracking apps to track water intake, bedtime (if you tend to go to bed too late or too early), things you want to do more of or less of (like meditate or go for walks, take stairs instead of elevator, read books, etc). Some of these apps create streaks, provide reminders, and have other features that can help with follow-through and organization. Seeing your progress in the app can also help. Like if you had a goal to meditate 3 days a week and saw that you already did 2 days, maybe you’re feeling low and don’t feel up to it but are able to push through to unlock an achievement, keep a streak, make progress towards a reward you decide for yourself IRL when you do X for X amount of time you will go out and do a fun activity that you don’t get to do that often. 

I’m going through reviews on some habit trackers because I want to start using one again, but want a free or very cheap one with the most features available. I used Habitica before. It is gamified tracking. It you’re into gaming or find earning rewards for task completion helpful, it’d be worth a try. It is free. The con is that it takes time to learn to use. Plenty of how-to instructions online though. Habitica has lots of features and a big community of people using the app that form different support chats within the app for various interests they have. Habitica also has a subreddit. 

Another idea is the Daylio app for tracking moods and day to day activities, health symptoms, medications, etc. over time. I’ve been using this app for about 225 days. Daylio has a subreddit. Very helpful. 

Working on a high-quality leisure plan that works around the different seasons where you live and includes activities that involve doing, making/creating/building, learning, or social activities like board game nights, NOT online or streaming activities, video games, or anything with a screen.   I’m not saying don’t do those things. I’m saying to add or increase your offline hobbies and be intentional with your online habits. For example, I will get more out of an hour working on an art project than an hour browsing Facebook. I might need to watch a video on YT to learn how to use watercolor pencils or improve technique. That’s intentional use, rather than mindless surfing that tends to lead down a rabbit hole and end with where did the last 3 hours go?! I’m working on this for myself and learned about the ins and outs of the planning process in the book Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport. Ch. 6 is all about Leisure Planning. 

I’d also recommend googling Wellness Recovery Action Plan by Mary Ellen Copeland. It’s a type of relapse prevention plan. If you can find an eating disorder specific relapse prevention plan, I’m sure that would be helpful. The WRAP can be tailored to any kind of struggles. 

Workbooks and journaling can be powerful tools as well. Some people really like free writing. For others, it’s difficult. There are workbooks like The Way of the Journal that have structured therapeutic writing. You can also google Journal prompts or try googling stages of change and seeing if you can find journal prompts related to that or just related to ed recovery in general. If you’ve done any counseling and liked the style, getting a workbook for eating disorders or depression in a method that speaks to you (CBT, DBT, ACT) can also help. If you aren’t familiar with the methods, read up first and even try phone that offer CBT strategies to see if CBT is helpful to you before you make a purchase. 

Phone apps- there are CBT and DBT phone apps if those might help. There are also recovery oriented apps for food logging—Recovery Record and Rise Up. Art (if you enjoy it) is great, too. If you need a more guided process, there’s workbooks for art therapy for various health concerns. 

Depending on the climate of where you live- getting outside for sunlight (vitamin D) helps your mood, maybe taking a vitamin D supplement (also good for bone health), walks, stretching or yoga. Guided imagery videos on YT might be helpful if you experience anxiety. It’d be good to get a check-up for your physical health when you can, sometimes the doctor will suggest ways to improve your diet or let you know if you need a vitamin/supplement during your recovery due to the damage caused by your eating disorder. A multivitamin is always a good idea.",nicoleinthesky,1568415510.0,2019-09-13 17:58:30,"Thank you so much for all this valuable info!

You don't know these people, and you don't know if they'll ever be involved in your life in an unrelated way, or if they are friends with someone who may be involved in your life either. There's also the risk that future employers may search your name and your mum's posts about you could come up because we all know parents don't understand privacy settings. 

I don't know your relationship so obviously can't give you super specific advice - but if it was me I would explain to her how it makes you feel - especially about how she is representing you online with the innacuracies of her comments. I would also emphasise that by sharing these details online she is risking your privacy, your current &amp; future relationships, and potentially your career. You're not a child anymore, but even as a child you had the right to your privacy online. Perhaps you could give her the option that you don't mind if she calls and talks to these friends, but by commenting about you in a public forum she is **permanently** sacrificing your well-being for what ?

Our bodies are genetically wired to ingest all the food we can and store any of the excess after we burn off what our resting metabolisms and daily activities demand, in the form of rich, oily fat, to fuel us thru' the lean times when famine comes. But these days, *famine never comes!* Our bodies, alas, can't grasp this, and will still drive us to eat, eat, eat, and pile on, pile on the fat, nevermind when we are walking vats of lard.

All I've found to limit this is incessant squelching of my appetite, which rages 24/7 like a wildfire. When I fail, about one day in every three, I [laugh it off…](http://imgur.com/TcvSP06) And simply [renew the battle](http://imgur.com/o8pPzWW) come the next sunrise. *Wish I had better tips.

All I can tell you is that 
1. Your body knows what’s best for you. When it’s hungry, it isn’t just faking that so that you eat food and then suddenly become fat. 
When you feel hungry, your body is telling you it needs energy. When you are hungry, your body needs that energy and therefore is going to use it. If you eat when you aren’t hungry, that’s the main time when your body just stores the food in the form of fat; when you’re hungry that energy is mainly used, not stored.
2. Unless your weight slows you down or is severely unhealthy, there is no problem with it. You don’t have to be super skinny to be smart, or popular, or successful, or even to feel good about yourself. Your worth is found in God.

Some people find things out of recovery that work for them and recover that way so I hope you can do that and I hope you have a good support system. Find something that helps and fight anorexia as hard as you can to try to get through this semester and consider a treatment center in the summer. I’m sure you love what you do and want to continue so focus on that as I did not love tennis anymore my dad was very abusive growing up emotionally and physically he actually put me on the diet that made me anorexic I could only eat what he told me too.

Then just move on or distract yourself, maybe try forgetting about the meal or remember it with gratitude. After I eat something b3cause I'm with the people I love, I still do have some regrets but I try looking back at the meal as a success. 

Try going with the flow, maybe ask your bf for some thoughts. Don't feel super guilty cause you feel that way. Neither if its good or bad, habits (even thinking and mental habits) take time to change. 
Take care and believe in yourself &lt;3",1dkwutimdoing,1581789397.0,2020-02-15 11:56:37,Thank you so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Struggling with self Esteem so badly. Been restricting and extended fasting almost a year. Up to 7 days I'll go without eating. Almost passing out at work, feeling dizzy and breathless all day, racing heart etc.

Partially filled by bpd. Lack of sense of self. Beating myself up because I cheated on my husband after 12 years married. I hate myself. I feel fat and disgusting. He revealed to me a few months ago he's been watching porn the last 14 years we've been together even though I told him at the early stages of our relationship I feel insecure and ugly compared to those porn stars. I'll never be able to match them in looks and being as thin.

Its impossible to match what we're ""supposed"" to look like. I'm in the healthy Bmi range, at the lowest weight since I was a teenager. 4 pregnancies and births later he assures me I look great yet I still feel like a pile of undesirable crap.

I'm sorry you're struggling. You're not alone. It's exhausting. Deflating. I don't know what to do anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
