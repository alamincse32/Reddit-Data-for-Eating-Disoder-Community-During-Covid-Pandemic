Stage 4. Get everything checked, I went through several gastrointestinal surgeries with nothing abnormal. Drs told me I had ulcers or IBS. I was vomiting daily for several months.
They told me it was stress and gave me meds.
This kept on for months, I kept emailing my doctor that something wasn't right. 

I finally got a GI doc to do testing. He didn't read the results until after he got back from his vacation, so two or three months after I take this test he called and asked me if someone has already called to tell me I have two 5 inch lymphomas, yes, 5 inches - one at the top of my colon and one pressing against my descending aeorta. That was the worst bedside manner I've ever seen. My cancer doc was much better.

Told me, it likely started about 5 years before diagnosis. It's treatable because it's slow growing. Went through a year of chemo using Benta/B combo; it's less heavy hitting. Doc is saving the harder drugs for later, he says. 

I really hope that it's nothing, but even if its something serious, don't panic. Just go and get tested and keep asking questions until you get all the information you need.

16,ksjzsa,Squirrelhenge,"I recently went through two rounds of interviews for a job (which I didn't wind up getting). I did not mention my cancer at all. First off, it's illegal for them to ask or consider your health in hiring decisions. But that doesn't mean someone might not count it against you, and it could be extremely hard to prove it if you wanted to take action.

So leave the cancer out of it. Even once your hired and are on their insurance, you are under no obligation to discuss it. You'll eventually decide who amongst your coworkers you want to know. Let them earn your trust and friendship. If they can't do that, they probably aren't the kind of people you would want to tell, anyway.",1610046241.0,2021-01-07 13:04:01,OneMorePenguin,"No.  You don't know what kind of negative unconscious bias people might have.  Once you have secured a job, being more open about it is your choice.  Some people are uncomfortable talking about cancer.",1610046908.0,2021-01-07 13:15:08,Terminus_terror,"My original employer let me go because of a mistake I made when I was first diagnosed with cancer. While they were certainly legally allowed to do it, it scared me away from ever mentioning it to an employer again. I'm doing fine. I actually really love where I ended up so don't feel bad for me know that whether people recognize it or not, they may see you as ""less than"" or disabled. If you're comfortable, by all means bring it up and talk about it but personally I didn't and that was the right choice for me.",1610047255.0,2021-01-07 13:20:55,lab_god,No,1610047486.0,2021-01-07 13:24:46,brokecollegekid69,Not on a resume or interview. you can use it later on if theres a compelling reason like if your in healthcare and working with cancer patients and cay empathize with the journey.... if someone asks why you had a gap in employment say something like I had a personal issue so I took some time away from work to focus on that; you can clean up the language but that is what I went with.,1610049542.0,2021-01-07 13:59:02,KatCorgan,"Leave it out. This will sound rude, but if I saw something like that on a resume, I’d put the breaks on. Hard. Not because you had cancer, but because (again, I know this sounds harsh) it could come across as “give me the job because I had cancer.”  I know that’s not what you’re trying to say, but that is how it would likely come across. 

Interviewers are allowed to ask about job gaps. Given the pandemic, however, they may just assume that that was the reason for your unemployment.  Either way, you need to be prepared to address this. If you’re not comfortable discussing it, don’t. If the person giving the interview gives off horrible person vibes, leave it alone and give a generic answer like “There were some personal things going on at the time that made my schedule rather unpredictable. I didn’t think it was fair to ask any company to work around that schedule, and I was fortunate to have a good support system that allowed me to take the time off that I needed. Everything has been resolved now, though, and I’m very excited to return to work full time.”  

IF you feel comfortable with it, though, I say go for it and mention the cancer if they ask about the career gap. I know this is the opposite of what most have recommended, and this advice depends heavily on how soon you need a new job.  If, however, you mention it, and the employer is going to secretly discriminate against you for having/had cancer, it is so much better to not be hired in the first place than to be hired only to be treated like a pariah when they find out you had cancer, or if anything else comes up in your personal life that might make your work performance slip a little. You don’t ever have to mention any part of your cancer journey, even long after you’ve been hired, but (again, ONLY if you’re comfortable) avoiding a toxic work environment early on will save you from so much stress in your career. 

IF you do mention your cancer as part of the career gap, stick to the facts, don’t get deep or sad, and redirect the conversation back to your qualifications. Odds are that the person giving the interview has never had to deal with cancer and you don’t want to create an elephant in the room.  You also don’t want to derail the whole interview. You’re there to discuss whether or not you’d be a good fit for a particular position, not tell them your life story. Help them out.  “I was unable to work last year because I was diagnosed with cancer and my treatments were several hours long, during the normal work week, and always changing. I knew that that level of inconsistency in my schedule wouldn’t have been fair to me or my employer, so I opted to wait until my schedule was more stable. So, instead of working during that time, I spent my time between treatments reading books focused on soft skills to make sure I hit the ground running as soon as I was able to get back to work.  I made sure I kept a list of short term and long term goals and I made deadlines for myself.”  You don’t have to say you spent time working on soft skills or anything like that. Chemo is no joke and I know that it’s a good possibility that 100% of your focus could’ve been on keeping your crackers down. However, as I said before answer this question the way you would any other question. Give a brief, professional answer, and find some way to make it seem as though you went above and beyond in a way that would be valuable to the company. If their lives have been touched by cancer, they’ll know how much that answer really glossed over your hardships. If they haven’t, they’ll know you had a legitimate, practical reason for not being able to work. 

If they ask a follow up question or say something like “I’m so sorry to hear that” or “What kind of cancer did you have?” Keep your response incredibly brief, and, again, redirect to the interview. “Thank you. I had/have skin cancer (not sure what kind you actually had, but give the lamens term for the type and no need to give the stage). It was for sure a challenging year, but 2020 was a challenge for everyone, right? <insert cheesy, brief, interview appropriate chuckle here> It must’ve been such a strange and sharp transition here when everything went remote!”",1610059077.0,2021-01-07 16:37:57,HCCO,"OP, I am also on the chatty side and did not mention that I had cancer during the hiring process.

The company that ended up hiring me was also made aware prior to hiring me, but one of the studio heads who interviewed me was also undergoing chemo, so they were certainly more understanding.  My original logic was to be fair to the team hiring me and set expectations, but I always wonder how much it actually affected my prospects.  On the plus side, I’m now at another company who is also supportive, and they were aware of my treatment ahead of time as well.  I can’t say whether I’d disclose if I were to go back and do everything again, but the places who did hire me with that knowledge have both been fantastic and happy to work with me on custom setups like having a work PC at home.",1610057385.0,2021-01-07 16:09:45,abaconservative404,I’m on the job hunt too.

Sure in interview in very rare cases. Find an opportunity later on to use it as a compelling story, build your credibility, etc. it’s all about playing the cancer card but in strategic ways.

Not everyone thinks you're a hero for beating cancer. Even people who act like they love you and are so proud of you might really feel like the second you're gone, they're going to have a huge mess to clean up.

I had 12 lymph nodes removed from my neck and the entire left side of my neck and face was numb and tight, although it wasn't physically noticeable and I have long hair which covered my incision scars. I didn't say anything about my cancer until I had to, which was about two months after I started because I had a PET scan and knew I wanted to take sick time that day. So I divulged to my direct supervisor and slowly told other people in my department as I got more comfortable (and after my probationary period was up). 

That said, don't bring it up. It's none of their business and you don't want to jeopardize your chances of getting hired.

I say this because potential employers will take this one of two ways:

1. ""OMG they're such an inspiration! We should totally hire them because it shows how resilient they are!""
2. ""OMG they are a HUGE liability! Think of all the money that would go into them if they got cancer again!"" (or if the company naturally has a higher stress issues like construction or handling hazardous material, they could see you as a risk for you blaming them for having another bout of cancer)

For the 1 year I was out of work, I just tell people ""I was taking care of a sick relative"".",1610076907.0,2021-01-07 21:35:07,Celera314,"I would  definitely not put it on the resume.  Putting it there makes it seem as if you want the cancer to define you as a prospective employee, and I think this will be a negative.  In general, you want to be cautious about bringing any personal information into the interview.  Disclosing too much may cause people to question your ability to be discreet and professional in other situations.  

As far as explaining the gap, I'm generally opposed to lying in interviews, so I would be inclined to say ""I was diagnosed with a serious illness and had to take time for treatment.  The treatment was successful and I'm fine now."" Any interviewer who asks for more information than this is an idiot and I would think twice about working there.

It's best to always answer interview questions with examples from your work experience, not your personal life.  Second best would be to draw on educational experience, sports (""I learned to be a good team player in high school on the basketball team"") or any volunteer work that you may have done.  Even if your marriage counselor taught you a lot about managing conflict, I would avoid saying that directly.  Similarly, even though your illness may have taught you a lot about having a positive attitude or something like that, I would keep that information as kind of a last resort.

Although they should not take it into account, employers will -- consciously or unconsciously -- assume that you are likely to be absent more than most employees, as well as having high medical bills.  But talking about this too much in the interview adds another concern -- that as an employee you aren't really committed to the career or able to focus on work during the work day.  I once interviewed a woman who told me ALL about her divorce, and I could just picture her spending half the day chatting with coworkers about what a jerk her ex is, or writing him nasty emails, instead of doing her work.  

It's rather unfair, but something we wouldn't worry about with an internal candidate who we know well, is more worrisome with an external candidate where we have to make our decision based on really rather little information.",1610080969.0,2021-01-07 22:42:49,None,Nope,1610109387.0,2021-01-08 06:36:27,Toadie9622,"I would not do this, especially if you are a certain age.",1610212598.0,2021-01-09 11:16:38,svenkite,"As a fellow survivor, I would suggest to not mention it until your hiring has been done.

20,ksir9r,Galdin311,I'm not sure of the medical benifits of it.  I have S4 Colon Cancer and I think I want to do them to help me come to terms with the impending changes after my surgery next month.,1610043469.0,2021-01-07 12:17:49,Hotdog_jingle,"I’ll share my fairly recent experience. I was on immunotherapy when I tried 2 grams (fairly modest dose for first time) of mushrooms back in April - first psychedelic I’ve ever tried. I had a pretty nice, introspective time (closed eye visuals, spatial distortion, some emotional reflection about my mental health and negative mindset, a few moments of anxiety), nothing earth shattering, but did initially feel a bit of a serotonin boost in the days following  (I have a long history of anxiety depression). It’s a substance you have to respect and be in a good mindset and setting. 

However, 4-5 days later I spiked a fever and ended up in urgent care thinking I had COVID. They did a CT and I had new inflammation and shadowing in my lungs-no cancer progression, but a concerning finding after I had my best scan to date only two weeks earlier. It threw me for a loop for a bit and honestly as much as I was liberated to finally try psychedelics, I wouldn’t do it again after this fiasco. I now have colitis and am on a treatment break, I don’t attribute it solely to the mushrooms bc my GI situation had been trending that way for months prior, but I doubt it helped. In my case, I think my immune system went haywire due to nivolumab and my body seeing psilocybin/psilocin for the first time. I still sort of beat myself up for rocking the boat. I’ve been stable, my cancer has been pretty quiet and I feel pretty good overall - there will always be ebbs and flows. If I didn’t have cancer, I’d totally explore them further, but it’s a small concession to make. 

Chemo is a different animal, but I’d worry about a compromised immune system and taking in a fungus or any irritant (I have no expertise here, but would imagine it’s a risk). If she has months of normal bloodwork across the board and no ill effects from chemo, perhaps (not advocating anyone use mind altering substances unless they are fully apprised of risks and willing to roll with consequences - even more so in a cancer patient) they could evaluate. This isn’t to scare you off, but I think it needs to be taken into account. There’s documented value in psilocin, but it’s also closely monitored in those scenarios and controlled. Also mushrooms are known for causing nausea when ingested, so if she has developed unpleasant lingering nausea, she will be uncomfortable unless maybe taken in tea, but even then some degree of nausea is hard to avoid with shrooms. 

Tl;dr I wouldn’t rush into trying them at the moment - research and focus on staying healthy in the interim. No fear mongering, just my experience - she’s an adult. You can read more on the shrooms sub, but I guarantee everyone will just say “take them and a fat dose at that!” I wish your friend well going forward and a healthy life full of new experiences!",1610046390.0,2021-01-07 13:06:30,mariahthom,We did it we had fun she didn’t die thanks for comments,1610089657.0,2021-01-08 01:07:37,amylk346,Honestly I'd go ahead and do it on a day where she feels her best but I'd suggest if she's done them before to only take like half of what she usually has at first just in case and then see how it goes from there! :) enjoy guys!,1610045066.0,2021-01-07 12:44:26,lord_ive,"There are trials for terminal cancer patients to try magic mushrooms in Canada, for the purpose of easing anxiety and general mental health.

These trials would not happen if taking magic mushrooms could kill the user or were excessively dangerous.

However, if doing this, it is important that your friend is feeling positive beforehand. It is possible to have a difficult experience (“bad trip”) on magic mushrooms, but being in a good place prior to taking them will decrease the likelihood of this, and will increase the likelihood of a positive experience that helps her deal with her situation.",1610310371.0,2021-01-10 14:26:11,Fizziox,"I don't know anyone who died from mushrooms :D

33,ks2idv,Carliebeans,"My Mum also has very aggressive, stage IV grade IV RCC (clear cell). Diagnosed Feb last year, lots of bone mets in hips at diagnosis. By Sept, she was no longer able to walk due to multiple fractures.

She was doing Nivolumab and Ipilimumab infusions - she had 4 and her remaining kidney started to fail after a nuclear tracer for her scan. That put a halt on immunotherapy, then eventually removed the possibility of her going back on it altogether. Her onc said it wasn’t working. We later found out that it is effective only for 12% of people - we had no idea. Maybe if we did, we’d have been more prepared for failure. We did seek a second opinion with an onc who does a lot of research and trials for RCC. He said so far that her cancer has given the middle finger to everything that’s been thrown at it (immunotherapy, radiation) and anything else is unlikely to work. She is on Sunitinib (a TKI, like pazo), the last thing she can try.

But having said that, if your Mum is willing, and you are able to cover the treatment, I think you should go for it. I think it is something you will always wonder about - whether it could have worked for her. There can be adverse effects from treatment. My Mum’s thyroid started to fail so she is now on thyroid medication to control that. Other than that, she tolerated it fairly well - she wasn’t sick or anything.

There is a trial called Cosmic-313, but I believe that your Mum would not be eligible as she has had prior systemic treatment (one of the exclusion criteria). Definitely have a look to seek if there may be any clinical trials she may be eligible for.

My thoughts are with you and your Mum. I know how tough this is and what a beast RCC is. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if I can help in any way, even if just for a chat.

My mom has decided to stop her treatments, and focus on some ‘miracle water’ that is believed to work on some cancer patients. Definitely not the most practical way, even I myself isn’t convinced with it. But she has made up her mind, what I can do is continue supporting her fullest.

I guess she also understands that immunology may not work well and bring a lot of side effects. She is one who doesn’t like to take medication and finds it ridicule why when trying to save yourself from something you have to damage another thing. And it’s definitely not worth just for 6-9 months.

37,krzopb,GiannaDochas,"  I am so sorry that your mom has been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. 

About the diet, one recommendation that I strongly recommend is that of hydration. Since I do not really drink that much water prior to my diagnoses of breast cancer, I had to train myself to drink a cup of water every 2 hours. Another advice is for you to consult the Nurse Navigator. The hospital that I was in had a Nurse Navigator assigned to me and she was very helpful with all my concerns and issues. The Nurse Navigator is really the best person who can walk you through and point you in the right directions as you take care of your mom.

If your mom is able, I would also recommend going for walks. When I had my chemotherapy, I would pace about my house in an effort to energise myself. Slow walks are fine; there is no need to be fast about it…the idea is to get some movements and the stronger the body the better the resilience. 

I pray as you take care of your mom, you will remember that it is important that you take care of yourself. I pray that all would go well for your mom and for you as her caregiver.",1610127013.0,2021-01-08 11:30:13,Lisagreyhound,"Best list I’ve seen of things you can do:

It was very true, so I can 100% concur with what you are finding.  To be honest, there are legitimate reasons, and everyone is different: they have to face their own mortality through your own, could feel deep shame or embarrassment that they weren't there for you right away... there are a lot of people who just don't know how to deal with it.

I also think you'll find a lot of people are really unsure how to respect your boundaries. Personally the last thing I want to do is answer ""so, how ARE you"" texts 3 times a day.  Consider a site like Caring Bridge to share newsworthy events; you may find this is a good way to share information and your frustrations, get comments from people as they feel they are given permission to.

I just listened to an article on the radio that talked about the range of friendships we have in our life and how they change over time: observations on these different forms of friendship date back to the ancient Greeks with the concept of ""friends of virtue"" (the ones who are in most of your life story) and ""friends of utility"" (appear for a chapter or two). Both are legit, but different.  Reach out to the really old friends and try to keep those alive even if it takes a bit more effort. Recognize that some
Of the ""friends of utility"", they just aren't really meant to be in the current chapter of your life (and sorry to say, this particular chapter is probably not the favorite in many books).

And, as you say, you'll meet new friends - almost the exact definition of a friend of utility - that will give you what you need (support in a trying time) in exchange for something similar from you... keep your mind open as you progress through this path.

I was also in hospital and in a coma for sometime during my treatment, and now being 5 years past my initial diagnosis I have the benefit of hindsight to understand why people act that way.

There are really only  two reasons, both of them represent a poor reflection of your friend’s character but only one can be forgiven.

1) They don’t know what to say. Typically you’ll have these sorts of people come out of the woodwork on their own once you’re better and say things like “I wanted to help but I just didn’t know how”. To me this is a deep-seated weakness and shows they can’t be relied upon, but ultimately they’re worth taking back as friends even if they won’t be as close.

2) They are literally waiting for you to die. Now this may seem extreme, but I’m serious when I say there are some people so self interested and emotionally unavailable that they are actually counting on the fact that you won’t make it, and they will then take it upon themselves to make your death all about them. They’re not as common, but having had many friends pass away from cancer over the years I have seen it first hand. They are there at the beginning, get bored and realise your condition is a long process, completely distance themselves from you, and just when shit hits the fan they pop up out of nowhere and post all about it on social media and turn up at your funeral. If you’re honest with yourself, you know who these sorts of mates are, and when you get better they won’t come back.

Your best friends will shine through during cancer, people who you never imagined could be so loyal will demonstrate a level of commitment and solidarity that will show you truly what a friend really is, and they will be there forever. You can afford to lose the ones who walk away, because the ones who don’t never will, and they are the only ones that matter.

Sometimes it's just better to ""stay normal"", rather than switch  to caregiver role. We definitely crave normal - I'd recommend treating him no different than the day before he was diagnosed with cancer.",1609961162.0,2021-01-06 13:26:02,metastatic_mindy,"You basically positivity bombed him. 

I have been living with stage 4 breast cancer for 3 yrs now, the relationships I have, have changed. Some for the better and some no longer exist. All due to how people choose to treat me and my diagnosis. 

I can all but guarantee that your friend wanted nothing more than for you to treat him as you use to prior to his having cancer. I know for myself that I wanted to know about my family and friends goings on the good and the bad. I want them to call me and complain about their shitty date or that coworker who's voice irritates them. I want them to talk to me as though I am not something fragile and about to break. 

It also drives me nuts when people start throwing positivity at me. Demanding i stay positive or have hope etc. It is dismissive and it puts a level of pressure on us patients to fight or we will fail. We patients have no control over our cancers. We can not pray it away. No amount of positive thinking is going to cause our cancers to die. 

The only thing we have control of is whether we get treatment or not. This and who we keep in our circle. 

My suggestion is to apologise to him for place unnecessary pressure on him. For being dismissive of his situation and to ask him how he would like you to treat/talk to him going forward.  Do not put your emotional concerns regarding his diagnosis and treatments on him to handle. He is dealing with enough, he shouldn't have to also comfort you because you are upset about his situation.",1609971020.0,2021-01-06 16:10:20,truealimthah,"On the part about optimistic text, personally I would hate to be on the receiving end of them.

- get well soon
- don't give up
- [religious figure] will heal you / praise the [religious figure]
- send some random image they found online that they think is interesting
- stay positive

I never had the chance to ask my uncle how he felt about these but I would certainly not care about them if I saw any of these. As if telling someone to ""stay positive"" actually helps.

Sometimes it drives you insane, as a cancer patient, to have people who aren't suffering like you are send you optimistic texts. It honestly sometimes makes you feel worse.

Give him space. Wait for him to reach out to you. The best thing you can do is to continue to support him no matter what happens, and to do what he asks. You say that you want to know he's okay every day--well, he's telling you that he isn't okay. And there's nothing you can do to change that.

Having cancer (or any disease that can turn terminal) is life changing. It flips you on your head. Shoves your mortality into your face. It makes you question everything and everyone.

The d&c was because I was bleeding a lot every time I had my period. So that is probably why they did that. My biopsy was because my stupid doctor did a pap when I was at the end of my period even though I told him that prior to him doing the pap. And that tumor was just some fatty cells that grew. They eventually just did a surgery to remove it. Also my mom had cervical cancer when she was in her 20's, so for me ANY thing scares me. I wouldn't worry about it, since honestly there is nothing you can do to change it. When you were bleeding was the color light red or dark red? I also know that if you go for your exam every year, that is your saving grace.

Just try not to worry, I know that's easier said then done. I'll tell you,  I am 56 years old and I haven't had my period for about 5 years now, but 2 years ago I started spotting. I was with my mom,as she was the one who survived stage 4 cervical cancer.  She asked what color the blood was and I said it was dark. She said call the doctor now.  So I had to wait like 5 days to go in and they had to do a biopsy.  That procedure hurt....but then I had to wait for the results, and it ended up being nothing.  But it does scare you.  But what the doctor told me is this...you cannot change anything.  So always be proactive with your body. What will be, will be. And I thought, yeah she's right.

I got my results back yesterday from the pathologist outlined below:



Patient history and investigation- Abnormal bleeding.

Sample taken - Day 10 or 11 of menstrual cycle.

Type of specimen: endometrial curretings. 

Macroscopic description: multiple tan pieces of tissue aggregating  1cm in diameter. 

Microscopic description: Pseududodecidualised stroma and inactive glands consistent with hormone effect. 

Conclusion/diagnosis :Endometrium: hormone effect. 

Comment: Is patient on hormone therapy?

----------------
No, I am not on any hormonal medication.

In December, I was on anti fungal medication called Fluconazale for  three weeks (one tablet weekly  followed by a daily dose for a new fungal medication called Itraconazale, during the 4th week all for an unrelated issue. Both medications have menstrual disorder listed as an uncommon, or rare or common side effect depending on the source). 

A week before that, I took a long acting coriticosteriod shot in November 2020 for an unrelated issue. No other medication or hormone drugs. 

The only other thing worth mentioning I suppose is the extreme stress,  anxiety and depression I endured from October until December 2020, which left me fantasizing about suicide even though I knew I simply wanted an escape from the conditions in my life at the time, rather than wanting out of life in itself.  

In summary, the gynecologist i  said there was nothing to worry about, my uterus is fine and chucked it up to a weird cycle which he says happens from time to time. According to the doctor' notes taken after the D n C, only a santy amount of tissue was available in/ extracted from my uterus. 

Any advice or insights to offer regarding the pathologist's report? Or the gynecologist's assessment?

Yes, my god, how I get what you’re feeling you have no idea. I went to all the appointments with her, re-read all the CT scans and sometimes even asked for one more to the radiologist. I’ve always thought that if I were able to decrypt the result of the CT scan, I’ve might been able to save her.
Knowing is so painful, tho. A friend of mine died at 24 of metastatic osteosarcoma in the lungs. I knew his sentence right when he was diagnosed, because we know those things. His parents were unaware or just decided to focus on the positive and the whole family was truly an inspiration for both me and my mom. She often told me “he underwent 50 chemotherapies and so many radiation and he’s still here, I can do it too then”. But sometimes you just knew. When that spot lights up on the CT scan and someone may just think “oh well whatever” but you know what it means. You just know. And I’ve known for months. But knowing is both a condemnation and a salvation: knowing that my time was limited, I’ve poured all my love in her. I moved back home, I’ve won a PhD right in her hospital and I got to spend almost three beautiful years with her, for whom I’ll always be so grateful.
Please, try and do the same. From daughter to daughter, from scientist to scientist, try not to let the science part of you take advantage of the daughter part of you. You are a scientist, but not her doctor. In the last six months I decided I was just a daughter in need of her mother, not her medical advisor.

There have been improvements in the latest years, eg PARP inhibitors for those who have BRCA mutation.

I'll be more than halfway done in two more rounds (I have to do 17 total).",1609892831.0,2021-01-05 18:27:11,Egoy,"There are tons of different chemo treatments and people react to the differently so please keep in my mind that your experience might be very different from mine. Also what I have is pretty rare so my chemo plan is an odd one.

I have two different treatments. I do a round every three weeks. On odd numbered rounds it's a single day outpatient treatment with three chemo drugs a urinary tract protective drug called mesna and hydration. On even numbered rounds it's a 5 day inpatient stay in hospital and I get two different chemo drugs mesna and hydration.

For an outpatient day I show up in the morning my port site is sterilized a needle is inserted and it is secured in place using an adhesive film. I have a comfy chair to sit in and I begin with hydration then move to chemo then get mesa and hydration. It takes about 6 hours total but again I am getting 4 drugs with hydration before and after many patients arrive after I do and leave before I do. During treatment I have to urinate often due to the amount of fluids I am getting and the fact that my chemo can damage my bladder so my doctors and nurses have told me to never 'hold it' and to go as soon as I feel an urge to do so. The nurses check on me often and I usually read a book or nap.

That evening is usually the worst for me for side effects I am extremely dizzy and nauseated but I have a schedule of medications to take that keep me from vomiting and a PRN (take as needed) medication that is a strong anti-nausea drug and makes me sleep as well so I usually pop one of those as soon as I'm home and sleep through that evening and night to avoid the worst of it. Over the next day or two I lose my sense of taste. At 24-48 hours post chemo I take a white blood cell booster that makes my bones ache for a few days. My sense of taste returns on days 10-12.

My inpatient stay is similar except I get chemo every day for five days and usually sleep read or play games on my Nintendo switch for most of it. The food sucks and I get very bored but after a couple of days I'm tired enough to nap during the day and that passes the time.",1609892408.0,2021-01-05 18:20:08,G-42,Thanks for that.

75,kr04kg,Seratio,"Hey, I'm a 22 year old male that did cisplatin and etoposide last year. Carboplatin and cisplatin are highly similar and perhaps my experience can help you feel a little better.

My side effects were temporary hair loss, weak tinnitus, a little nausea during treatment days, lack of appetite as well as sleeping a lot. My immune system was weakened but I didn't suffer any infections besides bacteria (*clostridioidies difficile*) resulting in diarrhea for a week. I lost a bit of weight, too. My hearing is fortunately entirely unimpaired as of right now according to an extensive hearing test I took. Zero neuropathy. A bit of acccumulated water from all those infusions easily removed with a diureticum (meds that make you pee). 

Docs always made sure to monitor side effects. For instance, they had me take a hearing test at some point to rule out hearing loss after my tinnitus started before continuing treatment.",1609888097.0,2021-01-05 17:08:17,Melodic_Machine_9818,We are praying for you!

81,kqsjcc,prarpin,"If they are not aspirating bone marrow, it will hurt somewhat if you are male. I'm not sure about females as they usually have less dense bones then men (my PA's statement, not mine). I know that the bone marrow biopsy part wasn't too bad, especially compared to the marrow aspiration. 

I won't do bed-side marrow aspirations again. I make them put me under. Luckily, I now go to COH, where they have awesome anesthesiologists. Some of them will give you the option to enjoy the MJ drug before they put you out...which is super awesome, btw.

Good luck. Hope you get a good result and it's not cancer.

Edit: forgot you asked about recovery. You should be able to walk out within minutes. The site will be sore for a while until it heals a bit. I've had PAs and Dr do them, and I feel it depends on the person doing the procedure is how long it takes to recover. I've had 7 to date, all in my hip with marrow aspirations.

I've got severe unexplained tachycardia, drenching night sweats, weight loss, hemolytic anemia, was in the hospital with sepsis fairly recently, and I have a problem in my neck that's only been documented about 8 times ever, which happened as a consequence of the near suffocation.

82,kqs8dv,Dyalad,"Mets can show up anywhere in the body, sometimes at the oddest places. It’s logical to check out first around the tumor area, but no one ever knows where a mets will end up sticking to. The ideal scenario in all of this is the metastatis is secondary to the cancer (by that I mean, the mets would be rectal cancer cells). There is also a possibility that the liver mets are a primary liver cancer. If that is the case, it becomes problematic because you have 2 different types of cancers to treat, and some cancers don’t respond to the same chemo than other. You can’t stack chemo meds for many reasons, so you essentially gotta treat them one at a time and hope for the best.

Regarding living a long life after cancer, yes, it definitely happens. Some people have lived dozen of years cancer-free. But everyone and every cancer is different. Nobody can tell. The important thing is that your partner listens to his doctors and does what he’s being asked to do to increase his chances of survival.

All the best to you and your partner.",1609847979.0,2021-01-05 05:59:39,Lisagreyhound,"This is essentially what happened to me. We thought my breast cancer had spread to my liver but in fact it was a different cancer. Luckily some chemo is used for all different abdominal cancers & breast cancer too. So I’d probably have done the same chemo regardless of which type it was.

For Oligometastatic (only a few spots) patients there is a relatively new theory that we might be curable with aggressive treatment. The cancer sort of learnt to spread but not very well.

At 22 i had a different cancer but ended up with a permanent colostomy off my sigmoid colon due to placement of the tumour. 

So happy to answer any questions regarding that. It was emotionally tough and from a body image and self esteem/social confidence point of view, challening. I am 1 year out now and enjoying life.

First of all it sounds like you're doing all the right kind of stuff. Being a caregiver is tough - there's no right or wrong way about it. A lot depends on the cancer patient themselves. 

I'm (31M) going through my second round of cancer now and my wife as my primary caregiver has had some of the same challenges that you're experiencing now. From my point of view, the thing that's most helpful is just being there and being present. Knowing that there's someone around I can depend on when I'm feeling shitty is a big comfort. Other things that help?
-doing the dishes or little chores without me asking, because she can tell that I'm too tired to
-checking in with me if I'm seeming down. If I want to talk about it, she listens. If I don't, she gives me a big and lets me know she's there. 

That covers like 90% of what I need. In most cases, there isn't much that other people can do for emotional or physical pain. We have meds for the physical pain and the doctors/medical team will take care of us medically. Our loved ones can offer social support. 

I know that a constant source of anxiety for my wife is that she isn't doing enough or she isn't doing the right things. I think it's a very human feeling to have. When you feel those things, I'd just encourage you to accept that they are valid feelings and that it's okay to feel that way. Keep lines of communication with your partner open and know that even if you aren't perfect, you're great and he's fortunate to have you. 

Best of luck with everything and hope the treatment goes well!",1609807609.0,2021-01-04 18:46:49,Lisagreyhound,"Best list I’ve seen of things you can do:

98,kqj5wn,moodle445,"I went through chemo young. It's horrible for 3 main reasons:

1) it is socially isolating. It's like you want to see your friends but then you actually feel to exhausted to even engage for long and feel embarassed about your fatigue. 

Tip: if you organise catch ups have someone else there like a sister etc so that she can rest her eyes for a seci and you can pick up the slack and entertain the guest. I got a lot of anxiety of not being able to keep up. Also at times they just won't want to see anyone but family.  Try and understand those times. 

2) It is scary and creates huge emotional baggage. You lose that innonence that bad things don't happen. And contemplate your mortality.  Allow those conversations to happen. She'll need to vent and explore these feelings. There's anxiety afterwards too that every normal ache or pain is it returning. There's a lot of anger. Why me. There's guilt. I felt so guilty as i needed so much help and care during chemo and i felt guilty relying on my family and putting them through that. There's social anxiety feeling different to your peers. There's the realisation of suffering. I grew a major fear of not dying but of chronic illness. As it feels like it's never going to end. It's hard to keep lining up for something that is so horrible. Also treatment can cause physical changes and fertility ones. So there can be so much life disturbance so seek therapy if needed and just listen. 

3) Chemo mucks up your neurotransmitters big time. I was severely depressed when in chemotherapy and it lifted in my off weeks from treatment. For the 7 days post chemo I'd hardly want to talk, had panic attacks and cried a lot. But then started to feel sane as i got further from it. So recognise that may happen and don't panic usually not permanent you just gotta ride through. I'd actually recommend therapy post treatment. During chemo i was actually too sick physically or mentally to actually engage so don't force therapy during the acute phase.",1609801765.0,2021-01-04 17:09:25,digitalvagrant,"There are a lot of different side effects that come with chemo, but the anti-nausea drugs they have these days are much better than they used to be. Honestly, probably the side effect I struggled with most was the constipation. I had a horrible experience with it after my first round of chemo. So stock up on gentle stool softerners like Senokot/senna, also Miralax or gentle laxative teas. I ended up taking the stool softeners daily and that helped a lot. Constipation is one of those things you want to get out ahead of. If you wait until it's a serious problem you're too late.",1609820941.0,2021-01-04 22:29:01,handofdumb,"Hi!

I just went through chemo last year.

One of the things that helped me the most was counting down the treatments. Knowing that the shitty feelings (mental and physical) had their days numbered helped me keep my eye on the prize!

I had a decent support system around me, which was great! But commenting on reddit posts, joining discussions in this subreddit's Discord channel, talking to folks at my treatment center....that was a big help.

I was also really worried that eating my favorite foods would make me hate them later, associating them with being sick and all that. So, I ate a lot of stuff I didn't usually eat and ordered food from places I don't care if I ever go to again (looking at you, Jimmy John's and Arby's).

On that note, cold sensitivity was big with me and I LOVE cold drinks, so that was tough! Plus you gotta stay super hydrated on chemo. But having a lot of drinks around that taste fine when they're room temp (I got burnt out on tea quick). I had a rotating supply of kool aid, capri suns, yoohoos, apple juices, weird fruity v8s, and a bunch of other stuff (opting for low sugar when I could).

I wish I had more tips! My memory of it all feels a little fuzzy now and I'm not sure why - maybe my brain is trying to forget, lol.

We're seeing my sister's (41) medical oncologist for the first time this week. She had a surgery in early November to remove a large ovarian cyst/tumor.

One thing you can do is mentally prepare for the specific drugs she'll use. You can read up on potential side effects. We're going to get cool socks/gloves to try to help prevent neuropathy which is a side effect of one of the chemo drugs she'll be taking. Depending on the center such things may be included so be sure to ask questions about making her comfortable.  Also the doctors will have lots of preventative treatment or drugs to counter act side effects.

There's a lot going on and your sister may not want to research her cancer. So you can look into the local society/organization/non-profit for her specific type of cancer. They will have even more detailed information for her and your family. We got a lovely bag and blanket with a packet of information on her specific cancer that she'll be using during her chemo.

You're not the first to go through this journey and it's a little relief to see people sharing their experience.

99,kqj3d3,liz_eliza,"She could easily have an infection and that does seem to be the case based on the dentist's reaction.  However, assuming that the infection is from them messing up the biopsy is making a big leap.  Infections are extremely common and they are the number 1 risk anytime you do anything invasive.  If you review the consent forms she signed before the biopsy, infection is probably at the top of the list of possible side effects.

However, I would be concerned that they apparently ignored her reports of pain, redness, swelling, etc.  If she was telling them this at every visit, or phoning and letting them know or whatever, and they ignored it, that is a red flag that they aren't paying close attention to their patients.

104,kqg86a,p7deletion,"First, get her to a specialist. A generic oncologist is not nearly as good and a specialist will get you better treament and outcome. I received my bone marrow transplant in Seattle at the superb SCCA. I highly recommend them since you are in the area. I've had the fractures, the MRIs the PET scans, the bone marrow biopsies (5 of them), induction chemo and the transplant of my own stem cells on July 23, 2019. My disease has been undetectable since them and I've been back to work full time since October, 2019. They're very good at forestalling MM these days, and the treatments are not so horrible. Remissions of a decade or more are possible and folks often live for 10, 15 or more years after diagnosis by having multiple transplants. Life between transplant cycles is mostly normal. If she is approved for transplant, she will need a full-time caretaker for anywhere from 6 weeks to 6 months, to monitor her, keep her schedule and make sure she takes her meds, as well as helping her get around keeping the living quarters clean. Feel free to ask me anything here or in PM.",1609795917.0,2021-01-04 15:31:57,KatCorgan,"For me, it wasn’t my mother, it was my father in law, so I know I can’t relate on the same level, but his cancer diagnosis was heartbreaking and shocking to me nonetheless. I remember the helpless feeling. It was terrible. 

I honestly don’t know if anyone in his family or he went to therapy, but I sent my husband. He started to really struggle with handling even minor stressors in life. My FIL was diagnosed almost at the start of the pandemic, so I couldn’t say if the change in was due to his dad’s diagnosis or having to suddenly work full time while splitting childcare (3 kids under 5 years at that time) responsibilities with me who was also working full time, but my guess is that it was a combination of both. The therapy was not a cure all for my husband.  He definitely still has outbursts that he was not having a year ago, but it noticeably helped. And, when the end came for his dad, there were certainly moments where I had to step in, but, for the most part, he did so well. Understandably, he was incredibly upset, but he also seemed to approach his father’s death almost with a plan. He seemed to have a list of things he wanted to tell his dad before he went and made sure he said all of them. He knew what to say (and not say) to others. He knew when to offer a hug and when to leave things be, and I honestly think the therapy was a huge part of that.  I encourage you to seek therapy and for you to encourage your mom to seek it as well. 

For me, personally, when my FIL was first diagnosed, I made him a little “chemo kit.”  He had esophageal junction cancer, which had spread to his stomach and liver before it was discovered. The esophageal cancer made things like eating very difficult, so I packed hard candy to help with the nausea, though he didn’t really experience much of it as a direct result of the chemo. At the suggestion of a fellow Redditor, I put together an iPad just for him. I loaded up pictures of us and our kids. I created an email account for him (because, no, he didn’t have one before) where we could send him encouraging emails and more photos. I put the Netflix, Disney Plus, and, IIRC, some other puzzle and history apps on there. We gave him a really warm hat and a warm blanket, since the weight loss was making him cold all the time, despite the fact that his chemo started in May. I put some lotion in there, chapstick, and a few other things that I read chemo patients really enjoying. It’s not much, but putting something together for him that would provide him comfort, even superficially, was helpful for me. 

This will, of course, depend on your situation, but you should consider letting your employer know, and taking the time off that you need. Remember earlier, when I said there were times I had to step in with my husband?  The day after his father passed, he logged in to work first thing in the morning and started working. Not because it was therapeutic or anything for him, but because he thought his dad dying would come across as a crappy excuse to take a few days off. I put a quick stop to that. Seriously, when you have a family member with cancer, be selfish. Take the time you need. Lean on people in a way you normally wouldn’t do. Do what you need to do to try to get to a place where you need to be. Others will understand. Others want to help you, they just don’t always know how.",1609798517.0,2021-01-04 16:15:17,cmmtay,"Multiple myeloma is tough, but it is a very manageable cancer.

My mum was diagnosed in summer 2017. Her biopsy revealed that it was a very aggressive form of the cance (due to mutations), and they only gave her another few years, but she's still going strong!

A myeloma specialist is going to be crucial for you and your family. It is a very weird cancer, and doesn't really follow the ""rules"" as far as cancer goes. The multiple myeloma foundation is a great resource. 

Additionally, you should know that there are hospitals that do bone marrow/ stem cell transplants, and then there are hospitals with an accredited program. Before your moms treatment, if it is required, I would suggest making sure that the hospital she ends up going to has an accredited program. A myeloma specialist can also help you navigate some of this.

Also, I would try and stay calm (I know! Its hard and I sound crazy!) Because there are so many different form of Multiple myeloma. Wait for the results of the bone marrow biopsy as those will be the real indicator or severity. And again, even if it is aggressive remember how many strides and medical advances have been and continue to be made!!! They are helping my mum and will surely help yours as well!

They aren't the ones making very difficult decisions and living with someone who needs care and is in pain.

When my husband went into hospice, there was a point at which his pain was pretty bad (the cancer had spread to his bones). I called hospice and they told me to give him a dosage of pain medication that was 4x higher than what he had been taking. He had been taking the pills very conservatively and should probably have been taking a higher dosage, but he was in control of his own dosages at that point so we let him decide when/if to take them. After I told him to take the higher dosage and he did, his cognitive function immediately declined and he could barely stay awake.

Queue a bunch of relatives telling me he was ""overmedicated"" and needed to lower his dosage so that he could ""get back to living his life."" You mean the life that's about to end? Also, whenever I check in with him after this, he said his pain was gone, so even if the medication was solely responsible for his brain fog, it was worth it! Finally the relatives hounded me to talk to hospice to get them to lower the dosage of pain medications and hospice actually told me to UP the dosage if needed, because at this point he was bed-bound and we needed to give him extra pain meds if we were moving him, like changing the sheets.

It turns out he only had a few days to live after that and was never going to get back to any sort of normalcy. He most likely had mets in his brain, which were partially responsible for the drowsiness and confusion.

I think people who want you to get second opinions when someone is on end-of-life care are probably in denial and don't want to face reality for as long as possible.

Both my step-mother and a very good friend of mine shaved their heads with me. The hair loss aspect wasn't my biggest concern but it was still very nerve-wrecking, and at least having support around me was nice. My step-mom from day one wanted to shave her head (she was kinda just looking for a reason) and then my good friend who joined us volunteered to shave her head as well (her sister has been battling cancer for a while now so she had thought of shaving her head before). 

I can't say that it made a better experience for me because they also shaved their heads, but I think it definitely took some of the pressure off of the situation. And then after we hung out and tried on wigs, hats, and took some photos while enjoying our newly bald heads! 

There is no right way to show support, just ask your friend. It could be something that they wouldn't care for, or it could really lift their spirits. It really just depends on them. It could also be a very different experience for you since you would be shaving your head separately... But overall, the best support for me was knowing that my friends were there for me through it all, good and bad. And that they were thinking of me and cared for me. Even if I didn't always respond to them, they still made themselves present and available.

I had doubled vision and a migraine that lasted 11 days, july 4th of 2019 i went in to get a brain MRI, they saw a big mass (tumor) and I couldnt leave. Upon further deliberation about the images they were pretty confident it was cancerous but had to plan a surgery (to biopsy the tumor and relieve pressure buildup). So July 8 (still 2019) i got that surgery and stayed in the hospital for another 4 days until the 12th when I left. The biopsy results came back and on July 15 2019 I was diagnosed: grade 4 diffuse midline glioma H3 K27m mutant. Rare pediatric brain cancer. Im 22!

Cancer patients taking part in clinical trials typically are your stage 4 patients who have no other treatment options left to try but clinical trials. These trials carry huge risks and this is why they are not being tested on healthy patients. 

Now for some real world experience. Everytime one of the oncology clinic nurses have to set up an infusion (or remove an infusion bag) whether it be a chemotherapy cocktail like FEC or a targeted treatment like Herceptin they have to put on PPE. This includes gowning, gloving, masking and in some cases protective eye ware. Because the risk to them is great.  

All cancer medications carry risks and like many other medications out there they have off label uses which means that while it maybe predominantly used for one illness it has been shown to be effective for an entirely different illness.  Drugs do not have to ability to tell the difference between healthy cells and unhealthy cells.  This is why we lose our hair during chemo, get mouth sores, have GI issues. The drug targets fast replicating cells, but doesn't know the difference between a cancer cell and cells that make up a mucosal lining. Same for targeted treatments. They are designed to attack a certain type of cell but those cells are not necessarily exclusive to cancer. 

A healthy person taking a targeted cancer drug will experience the same type of effects as a cancer patient but without the benefit of killing off cancers.",1609686022.0,2021-01-03 09:00:22,None,"Well this site is for folks trying hard not to die, and for the people who are caring for us.

Even with family wanting to stop by it’s easier just to say I’m quarantined till cancer is 100% gone. It’s a valid reason that even the parts of my family that don’t believe in covid are respecting. I think for those family members they believe the sick are most at risk but healthy people shouldn’t worry (stupid I know) so they love me enough to not want me dead lol.,1609660455.0,2021-01-03 01:54:15,bluegray6,I cut out anyone that wasn't supportive of me during treatment.

137,kpdujs,meisen99,"There's no question that cancer affects everyone and I have good friends who have been on both the caregiving side and and patient side and say the caregiving side can actually be the worst.

You and your mom will need one another in the coming times.  Do your best to be there when she's down; hopefully she can be there for you when you are down.  When you are both ""up"", try to take advantage of being in a good place and enjoy the positive moment. When you are both ""down"" and not in a good position to support one another, well, that happens too.  

Try not to think of yourself as ""selfish"" : there are times you will need to focus on yourself but as long as you are balancing this with moments where you focus on your moms needs, or your step dad's needs, then you are doing ok.

I strongly urge you to consider looking at what kind of emotional and mental health support you can get through your health care system, and give that a try.  Having third parties to help you talk through these issues can be very helpful.

139,kpbno1,Traditional_Listen97,I’m so sorry. My mom doesn’t have long and she’s my only parent and my main support on the earth. I’m so scared I don’t know what I will do when she is gone. I got some advice from someone that told me to get an animal to care for. They said it helps. :(,1609669033.0,2021-01-03 04:17:13,BibCalabaza,"My dad passed a week ago, and I’m just gonna describe what happened with him. It might be a little heavy to read, so consider this my TW. The way he went was pretty by-the-books, although I didn’t know that at the time. He completely lost his appetite and desire to drink anything at about three weeks. I’m not convinced he didn’t just starve/dehydrate himself to death. Unfortunately at a certain point, it just made him so sick to drink anything. He started to get confused, not being able to finish sentences or follow a train of thought. Rather than try to have conversations, I would keep it to simple statements like “Jesus Dad, I hate seeing you like this,” to which he could easily reply, “That makes two of us!” Old jokes are good too. He also started to exhibit dementia, trying to go to work at 3am (he’s been retired for years), thinking there were two women in the house (only my mom was there), asking why the backyard never changed, etc. He needed a walker for the last couple weeks, and toward the end, he fell a couple times. On the last day he was on his feet, he could barely make it to the bathroom with the help of two of us, like he just had no control of his feet. We called the fire dept and they got him into bed, and he was way less foggy when he laid down, but by the next day, he could hardly speak, and mostly slept. The day before he passed, he was awake, and I was able to look into his eyes and nonverbally say goodbye. That was one thing that bothered me, he was there and awake but couldn’t move, and everyone else spoke like he wasn’t even in the room. What he needed was to be able to look at his loved ones and share those final moments. I had a tough time holding it together and I feel like I failed him, not spending more time in the room *WITH* him. Final day, we kept him doped up on liquid painkillers every hour because he was otherwise in pain. He didn’t wake up, just raggedy “wet” breathing all day until he stopped. The whole thing was pretty horrific if you haven’t seen it before, but knowing what to expect makes it easier. Anyways, I’m 36, I can’t imagine going through that at 21 and I’m so so sorry.",1609671831.0,2021-01-03 05:03:51,5pens,"I'm so sorry.

And taking the daily thyroid pill is really NBD to me now.",1609643841.0,2021-01-02 21:17:21,131i,"My (42F) thyroid was removed 28 years ago, when I was 14. Life without a thyroid is about minor inconveniences. But it's a pretty normal life, all things considered. Still having one would be nice, but I don't think I'm missing out on all that much. The iodine treatment was a blip, all things considered. It didn't damage anything it wasn't supposed to, the surgery was really the tough bit, and he's already through that. It's going to be okay.",1609647381.0,2021-01-02 22:16:21,InvSilence,"I can provide two perspectives here.

I had the same surgery right at two years ago now and radioiodine therapy about 3 months after that (March 2019).   I was given a pretty substantial iodine load at the time.  The treatment itself is a bit underwhelming.   It was a pill (in my case 2 pills).   Afterward, I did not experience any of the side effects.   No discomfort, no nausea, no swelling.   While each person is different, that experience with no symptoms is pretty common.

I will also tell you that I've felt better the last two years than I did the previous five.   Sure, I have to take a thyroid pill each day.   But, as a trade off, I feel like I    am my ""old self"" again.  The thyroid cancer and all the extra thyroid hormone in the system can really change you.   This treatment also provides some peace of mind to make sure that all the thyroid tissue is really gone.   it's worth it.

The other perspective I can share is I'm also a nuclear engineer.   While radiation can be scary and it should be treated with respect like any treatment/tool, this one is pretty low impact.   Iodine really only collects in thyroid tissue.   The nature of the radiation (beta) also means that they do not penetrate/affect substantial tissue around the remaining thyroid tissue (0.6 to 2 mm more or less).

Iodine not taken up by thyroid tissue will pass through and out of your body pretty quickly (less than two days...more or less).   One of the most important safety precautions around this treatment is bathroom hygiene.   Excess iodine passes out primarily as urine.   Wash your hands!    Wash your hands!   Don't worry, the hospital will give that reminder many times.

I hope that helps.",1609679417.0,2021-01-03 07:10:17,betbuzzy26,"My son was diagnosed with TC at 23 (2019). He had RAI treatment and he didn’t experience major side effects.

It might be helpful to set your friends down and discuss what happened. They may be dealing with their own traumas, they may have thought you didn't want to be bothered, they may have assumed someone else was already helping you. Or they may not be as good of friends as you thought.

The whole ""I might be dying"" aspect of this past year really crystalized for me who was genuine and which relationships I'm willing to put energy into.

Anything I say here is either opinion,  or me hoping to find fear and hesitation instead of malice or apathy.

I think sometimes this happens because people are scared or unsure of how to act.  Cancer is ""the big C word"" to a lot of people - elderly who can't handle treatment as well, or younger folks that the only ones you hear about are terminal.  Nobody talks about the 25 year old who makes it through the other side.  So people hear that C word and they immediately go to the worst case scenario.  ""How long do they have left?""  And they get scared.  ""How do I look this person in the eyes and tell them it's going to be okay?""  They don't even know how to talk to you, because that big C is hanging in the air.  You've become associated with that word and people see it when they look at you.

Again, maybe I'm naive.  If they were the kind of friends who you could have a deep, heart to heart conversation with before, maybe it's worth talking to them.  If things don't work out, what can you do?  Life is full of people crossing paths for a time, and then parting ways.

If you feel up to rebuilding and giving them another shot that's fine but also you have plenty of room and certainly a right to ghost them and move on.

I went through the treatments and whatnot and I was busy with that, but ya no texts no calls just nothing. When I was in remission, it hit me how kinda messed up it was.

I've held up fairly well I like to think (lol). In the years that directly followed my treatments I often felt a lack of focus, fogginess, forgetfulness. Occasionally I still experience those things today, 12 years later. But I'm not sure because these could have other explanations now that it's been so long, and most of the time, I feel fine/normal. I'm female, and so far have not had much luck on the pregnancy circuit (just turned 35 so I don't have a ton of time there) so there could be some side effect-ery going on there.

The weird side effects of chemo are what drain me though. I’ve had this strange muscle tightness that happens randomly that started in my feet, then moved up my legs, then my hands, upper arms, and has hit my chest a few times. The worst thing though is what started with chemo and happened maybe once a month but now happens roughly ten times a day is my heart skips a beat. It hurts like hell, I lose my breath and begin panting. I’ve even nearly blacked out a few times from it and when it happens while driving, it’s terrifying. 

I’m 32 myself and my cancer was a post transplant lymphoma. Cystic Fibrosis and a double lung transplant make for a fun life. 

How were you treated when you were diagnosed? I got treated like a convicted murderer who wanted drugs. The day of my diagnosis, I was kicked out of the hospital and had “drug seeking behaviour” stamped in my medical chart. The drug I was seeking that got me kicked out of the hospital was an ice pack for a headache.

144,kp4x2x,PoetLaureddit,"Hey!

I can’t necessarily fully relate to cancer at 12 and 14, but I had it at 30. The hope is that you survive to see what I’m about to say, but we always feel like we’re too young for this stuff to happen - and we are.

It’s pretty scary not to know what your health will be like, but it seems like you have good perspective on how your treatment is going. 

No one gets to tell you how to live your life (especially not strangers on the internet), but I would say that if you keep the positivity in can only help. At the same time, if you’re sad or scared or upset, those are all normal given the situation. 

Cancer sucks, and sometimes there’s not a lot of analysis other than ‘try as hard as you can to get through.’ I wish you all the best.",1609621042.0,2021-01-02 14:57:22,angryhaiku,"Hi! I'm sorry you're going through this mess. I had sarcoma too, with lots of mets -- five or six in my lungs, and two in my brain. My doctor told me was that sarcoma tends to plant ""seeds"" elsewhere in the body, which is why it's so important to do things like getting pains checked out.   


Perversely, it's probably good that you never felt anything except for your shoulder, because that means the other spots were still too small to do any damage you could feel. I'm glad chemo isn't too hard on you!

I'd talk to you doctor about whether you need genetic testing. Do breast self-exams and ask you doctor about getting them, too. 

There is no test for cancer. Mammograms can screen for breast cancer and I'd ask your doctor when your should start getting those.

&#x200B;

My initial reaction to them was simply how efficient they were. My experience in hospitals is mostly just waiting around for a long time. But the cancer center was incredible. When we walked in (or rolled in, in my father's case), they had this long array of blood testing stations where a team of phlebotomists were calling up one patient after the next in a rapid fire blood drawing session. They went through so many patients so quickly, it was incredible.

&#x200B;

And then, immediately after drawing your blood, we head upstairs to meet with the doctor and by the time we see them, they already have our blood results.

&#x200B;

It absolutely blows my mind every time I go down there because of just how fast and efficient everything is. There is usually a pretty large crowd, but it feels like there is almost no waiting because there is always something to get done and they get through people so quickly.

Every step of the way was a discussion with me taking part of the decisions because me being young meant we had to decide how aggressive we wanted to be now in case it came back later or how it would affect my quality of life long term.

In defense of the U Chicago DR, he called me when I was in Houston going through the tests.  He was very supportive of my decision to move on (said if it was him he would have done the same thing).  What his “distraction” was during my consult with him was he did not believe the initial pathology reports, and he was right.  The original report was high-grade.  From what he was reading he believed it was intermediate-grade but needed to get the tumor to be sure.  Which they did within a couple of days of my consult appointment.  UC classified it as intermediate-grade as did MDA.  He was calling to let me know to pass that info on to the DRs in Houston as he did not want them to proceed with another surgery to remove my facial nerve.

I relate to your feeling of sometimes wishing for it to end just so they could have peace and leave all the pain and misery behind. I don't think there is anything wrong with feeling that way at all. When life is reaching its end and it cannot be avoided, and you are watching someone suffer, its only natural to wish that the suffering would stop any way it can.

I know it is torture to go through this, but try your best to be strong for her. Be there for her and don't let her feel alone or like a burden. When my father was dying, a lot of the emotional grief he felt was feeling like he was ruining our lives by dying. You can't know exactly what someone else is thinking or feeling, but if you think this may be the case for her, just let her know that everyone will be okay. Let her know how much you love her.

The one and ONLY good thing about wretched fucking cancer is that it gives you the time to say everything you need to say to someone. To tell them all the things throughout life that you should have said but didn't. To tell them how much you love them, appreciate them, and are grateful for the role they played in your life.

&#x200B;

We keep his memory alive though by telling stories about him to each other. He did so many things that were funny or sweet or just wonderful in their own way. Funny things he said or did. We still laugh at some of the things he got up to. Even though he is no longer physically with us, his memory will never leave us. We think about him all the time. At first, thinking about him was such a painful and horrible thing because we missed him so dearly, but over time that pain of loss and grief when thinking about him turned into joy and gratitude that we had him in our lives in the first place.

&#x200B;

He was such a positive influence on us and made all of us so happy, we were so immensely fortunate to have had him in our lives. It may not feel like it right now, with that pain still being so fresh and so new, but that wound will heal with time and you will feel the same way.

&#x200B;

We still miss him all the time and often discuss whether he would like a certain movie that came out or what he would think of some new technology that had been invented, or what he would've thought about a meal we just ate, like he is still with us in that way. And as long as we never forget him and continue sharing our stories and memories of him, he always will be.

&#x200B;

My advice to you is to gather up photos of your mother and videos too. That way if you ever feel like you are starting to forget what she looks like or what she sounds like, you can be reminded. You can bring them out every year on her birthday to be reminded or just whenever you feel you want to see and hear her again.

But outside of that people leave their footprints in our lives: You will find yourself doing something - a small habit, a saying, or facial expression and it will remind you of her. The little things she will have said to you in your growing up years will pop into your mind when you least expect them like not leaving your shoes by the front door.

My parents got married later in life, well into their 30s (not that this is relevant to the story, just kind of helps with timelines). Then my mother died suddenly of a brain aneurysm while I was quite young. No one expected it, and she wasn't even 50 when it it happened. They were together 13 or 14 years. 

This past year my dad and my step mom celebrated their 15th wedding anniversary. Also this past year, my dad and step mom went down to my mother's grave to pay respects on the 20th anniversary of her passing, something my step mother encouraged them to do. Every time I visit them my step mom always asks about my mom, stories specifically from me, not just my dad, out of genuine interest. She knows this woman was incredibly important to me and to my father. She never gets annoyed if someone in my family talks about my mom. She's been to family functions on my mom's side of the family, even when I'm not there, because my dad is still important to that family. She has never tried to replace my mom, nor has she ever tried to replace my dad's wife. They're a completely different couple than my dad and my mom were.

I think her sudden passing does make the situation different. You have the time to think through what life after you pass looks like, because it's something you've been outright told. for most of us it's more of an abstract thought. My fiance and I talk about what we'd do in the event one of us passes, but there's no denying we discuss this with the assumption that it won't be for many more years. But my fiance is only a few years younger than my mom was when she passed away, and I've known several people my own age that have passed away, so I'm not disillusioned to the idea that something could happen. I will be torn up about it, or vice versa. And it sucks to think about your significant other with someone else. But I truly believe that when that happens, no one is being replaced. I think that can be the scariest part of that. You feel as though he's going to replace memories of you with memories of a future person. And that's just not true.

It does have a propensity to metastasize later though. Our largest database comes from a prospective clinical trial (COMS).

In that study, after I-125 brachytherapy or enucleation, 5 and 10 year survival rates were about 90% and 80% respectively (no diff between treatments). Rate of distant metastasis was about 25% and 34% at same time points.

We continuously shape each other's way of looking at the world and nothing can take that away from us. That bond is irreplaceable and will never be lost even if our relationship were to end.

Well, and you're 21. The odds of a relationship that long are slim to begin with even in healthy couples - that's coming from a 22yo in a wonderful first relationship who is expexted to die in less than a year (who also had access to a huge data set with this kind of info for his bachelor's thesis). Ten years is a lot of time.

I don't know what's at the root of your fears. Perhaps some sort of insecurity given the 'why do you stay with me' questions, I don't know. Even so a licensed therapist can help you get to the bottom of those feelings to resolve them and get you to cope more easily.

It’s nearly impossible to imagine this  today. Remember how HIV was viewed as a certain death sentence  until triple cocktails changed everything  literally overnight in 1996?

The foundation of their research is a single crystal composed of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ (Bi2212). One of Klemm’s students, Ruqayyah Shouk, is working on the theoretical design of an array of such devices, which could increase the output power sufficiently for it to operate efficiently as a cancer detector.

Harnessing the power of a “supercurrent” generated by the Josephson effect, the team believes they can use a reflected wave to study tissue beneath the skin. Such a device remains years in the future, but the lab has proven the concept is viable through tests on a dried heart pea.

The 3D scan of the pea penetrated several millimeters deep to distinguish the three seeds at the bottom of the plant. That’s enough to give Klemm optimism for what’s to come.

&#x200B;

I was with my father, taking care of him during his final months as well, and in his case he needed full time care.

&#x200B;

The only advice I can offer is to use this precious time you have left to talk to each other. Say everything that needs to be said to one another. Tell him what he means to you, how much you love him, all the good stuff.

&#x200B;

Also, I don't want to be insensitive, but your final paragraph seems to imply you think he will spend his last days in a hospital. This probably isn't true, and certainly wasn't true in my dad's case. Hospitals don't want those kinds of patients because there is nothing they can do for them. I still remember the last month with my dad, if we took him to the emergency room when he had something happen, they basically told us that he was terminal and what was happening to him was simply part of his condition and there was nothing they could do about it. They would send him home or not see him at all. He died in our home. And honestly, that is for the best (for him) anyway. I know he, and I, and my whole family, and probably most people, feel more comfortable being in their own bed at home than they do in a hospital bed in a hospital room far away from familiar things. Your dad will probably die in your house and you should prepare yourself for that.

&#x200B;

Taking care of someone in that state is very emotionally difficult, but try to be strong for their sake. If you make them feel like a burden on you, it will make it worse for them. And it is hard and will be hard, but after it is over, you will feel good about what you did rather than having regrets and wishing you had done things differently.",1609769531.0,2021-01-04 08:12:11,melstar1111,Thank you for your response.

Cancer is such a horrible disease, about as evil as something can be without being capable of thought. But i've always said there is a single upside to cancer, and that is having the opportunity to say everything to the person you need to before the end. Anything you should've said but never did, any questions you ever wanted to ask but were maybe too afraid to or too embarrassed to before. My father and I spent a great deal of his last couple of months just talking to each other.

&#x200B;

I told him how much I dearly loved him and how much he meant to me. How grateful I was to have him with me throughout my life and all he had done for me. How I admired the strength he had to do all of the things he had done for his family throughout his life. Just everything. Things I never really said to him out loud before. And I am so thankful I had the opportunity to tell him those things before he was gone so he knew how loved and appreciated he was.

&#x200B;

You don't really need (or want) experience in doing this sort of things. You just have to love and support as best you are able. Help him do the things he can before the end. If he wants to eat anything in particular or if he still has the strength to GO somewhere, i'd take advantage of that while you can. Maybe it won't be this way for him, but my father went from walking, to walking with a cane, to being in a wheelchair, to being entirely bedridden. By the end he wouldn't eat at all, but before it got that far along he wanted to go out to some of his favorite places. Chinese buffets for example, my father loved this one in particular and we'd take him there and load him up on whatever he wanted to eat. We tried to think of anything we could to make his final days as pleasant and enjoyable as possible.

&#x200B;

I suppose everyone deals with grief and sorrow in their own ways, but for my family and I, telling stories about him helped ease our hearts. I think at his funeral, we spent about a third of it in stunned silence, a third of it crying, and a third of it laughing. We had so many stories about him that we would share with each other. All the things he had done that made us laugh or made us happy. And everyone had their own perspectives and their own stories, so we would all just share them with each other.

&#x200B;

To this day, talking about his death and funeral makes me cry (im tearing up right now just writing this), but we laugh and smile talking about him most of the time because we remember all the good parts. He was such a good, caring, and funny person. We even discuss sometimes what we think his opinion would be on things, like some new movie that came out or some new technology/gadget. It's almost like he is still with us.

&#x200B;

My advice would be keep two things in mind at all times: Make him as comfortable or happy as possible, and rather than considering or thinking about yourself in the present, instead think about yourself in the future. This stage of your life will be very short, but you will live with the memories of it for the rest of your life. Even if it is hard on you, you want to be able to look back and remember that you did everything that you could possibly have done and have no regrets about the situation. It'll be harder on the present you, but future you will be grateful for it for the rest of her life. I was hurting and distraught a lot in those last days, but I regret nothing about what I did or what happened because I know I did all that I could. And I can tell you, regret hurts a LOT more than grief and sorrow on their own.",1609774302.0,2021-01-04 09:31:42,melstar1111,Thank you.
