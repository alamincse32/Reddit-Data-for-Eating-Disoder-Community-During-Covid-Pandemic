3,savit66,1520474075,82tvic,5,"Hi all, 
so my mom as advanced stage uterine cancer. she has been in the hospital for about two months undergoing treatment with lung difficulty (i suppose caused from cancer.. her lungs were filling up with blood). I am not here for that. I am here to say I almost lost my mom Monday afternoon. I was in the middle of my psychology test, unaware that someone was trying to get in contact with me to inform me about what had happened once I left for school two hours earlier. She could not breath, she was gasping for air and could not breath. Luckily, they fixed it, got her on major oxygen (stronger then she's been on previously) and everything went up from there. Once I found out what was happening, I went into immediate panic. I was shaking, thinking the worst. When I got there I tried my best not to break down and cry out of being so scared (I did it anyway... I know it is not good for the patient to see their loved ones upset). I learned my mother signed a DNR. COMPLETELY out of her character. We were also told she would die very soon (today is Wednesday night and her oxygen levels have been 98). I began questioning who would make her sign something she wouldn't sign, it also made me question if she fully understood what a dnr is. All she kept telling me is she did not want to live on a vent. Okay. The dnr stayed in place until that night and the next day. I worked with my family and did everything I could to have it removed. No one agreed with this paper she had signed and I was quite confused why they did not ask my dad who is her next of kin who should have made her decision while she could not breath. 
All I kept thinking, is oh my god she could go into this not being able to breath business and they would not help her. I couldn't let it happen. Luckily with myself and family there, we had her get rid of it, it was made clear to me she did not fully understand what would happen with that in place. 
I just need to vent, to sit and tell someone, anyone how scared I am. 
Please for me, hug your loved ones tonight. ",Mom.,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/82tvic/mom/,1520495675.0,2018-03-07 19:54:35
4,Odin_Exodus,1520470017,82tgat,6,"Hey all,

It's been a hell of a ride all last year getting through chemo, radiation, and a few surgeries. My treatment began Jan 4 and ended Nov 17. First post-treatment scan this year came back all clear so I'm feeling blessed.


That said, I've had the opportunity to get back to work. I've found myself becoming increasingly aggressive or assertive in my position as a manager. To make a long winded and whiny story short, I am projecting my frustration for multiple things on the people I work with. Some of my associates understand and respect how I approach business while others just don't get it.


As a quick example, some people think they know everything but are making what I feel are simple mistakes and costing us BIG time in both lost revenue and creating unnecessary work for the entire division. On top of that, those same individuals think they're due a huge raise for whatever reason. It's causing me to lose my patience and my demeanor has become increasingly aggressive. I'm trying to be a team player but it's becoming difficult for me to control myself. 


For those who went through chemo, can you relate to my experience with becoming frustrated or aggressive? I know the causes of mine are dynamic and not everyone may connect with that, but I am curious if you've found yourself dealing with anger, frustration, aggressiveness, etc that wasn't there before. How did you manage it? Is it still ongoing?


Thank you in advance for your input.",Dealing with my Newfound Aggressive or Assertive Personality,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/82tgat/dealing_with_my_newfound_aggressive_or_assertive/,1520491617.0,2018-03-07 18:46:57

7,dreamfflower,1520445932,82qbt5,3,"Struggled with colorectal in 2012 and had a recurrence of it as stage 4 in 2015. While he was recovering from the second time he got diagnosed with metastasic lung cancer stage 4 in August of last year. My dad was scared, but I comforted him after we looked into a before and after of his first cancer levels and the last blood test he took in December. They showed lower levels of the cancer which meant to us that the chemotherapy was helping keeping it controlled. Early January he developed a small cough. Late January it was a small cough that brought somewhat pain. February 3rd he went to the emergency room because he was having difficulty breathing. February 10 he was transferred to the ICU. 

After doctors handled his case like a mess not knowing the cause of why he ended up in the hospital,(?!?!?!?!) they said there was nothing they could do. He passed away on the 28th of February after being on the ventilator for 3 weeks. No chance to say a proper good bye. The last time I saw him was before they introduced the ventilator and he was still headstrong, confident that he would walk out of the hospital at least by us pushing him out in a wheelchair. I really wish that happened. 

My brother, mother and myself were very emotional all of last month. After a week I'm impressed at my brother, being 15 he's handling the loss well at the moment. I still have my moments of sadness that he's gone, or moments of disbelief, or anger towards the doctors. My mom, however, can be fine sometimes still has little moments of denial, sadness,  and I have a feeling she's also going through some regrets. She's being way too tough on herself. I took a leave from work and school to stay by her side during the process but I feel like I can't help her if she keeps going through those emotions. I know it's absolutely hard to lose the love of your life.

My question after all the venting (Sorry), is how have you helped before? I want to be able to help my mom but I'm scared that she will stay in this stage for too long. I could be worrying and maybe it's absolutely normal, but I don't know it. I can't talk about this with my friends because no one in my circle has lost a parent yet.

Anxiety is the main culprit. Every itch, every pain, every weird sensation takes my mind to the same place: IS IT BACK? Looking for familiar symptoms, looking up unfamiliar ones, and always just wondering what if this and what if that? What if? What if? It's not like before my diagnosis where a back pain was just bad posture, a sore throat was just a cold, and a cramp was just indigestion. Now everything is cancer. I don't know how to not think like that.

Another culprit is guilt. I'm supposed to be thankful that I survived it. I know so many good people who didn't. Why can't I just thank my lucky stars and move on, enjoy my life? I am, trust me. I'm taking every day that I have on this Earth as a gift and cherishing it: every moment with my son and my husband, every trip, every laughter, every new memory. I love all of my life. But I can't help but feel sadness for what I went through and fear that I may have to go through it again, all of which leads me to feeling guilty that I can't just let it go.

Didn't think I'd ever be in this sub but here we are. I'm so sorry to everyone else who has had to visit here too.

My grandmother (mid 70s) had a hysterectomy 2ish years ago and they told her it will likely be the end of it. A few months ago the similar symptoms she had before came back, they've confirmed it's cancer again. It's not something people in my family are talking in depth about right now but I've been told she has a tumor which is growing everyday and she's in some pain. She is due to start 5 weeks of daily radiotherapy, surgery wasn't an option due to the location, I'm not sure where it is. I believe it's cervical cancer but I'm not sure.

I don't really want to ask this from my family but realistically what's the outlook for this? She's incredibly fit, active and healthy apart from this, but she is in her 70s. Can this treatment work? If not how long can she live like this for? I have savings and I am ready to blow them all making sure I go to as many places as possible with her but I really just need someone to tell me the truth and I don't know her Doctor and I'm 100% certain she will not ask this question.

Honestly just don't know what to do right now. I thought she'd go in for some tests and it'd come back good because of the surgery 2 years ago. I can't really believe it came back. My biggest fear is how my grandfather will cope. They have been married 60 years, he doesn't know a life without her needing him 24/7. It's how he likes to live.

My husband has relapsed Hodgkins lymphoma. He had GDP salvage  chemo regimen (that's standard protocol in Canada) before going into auto stem cell transplant. Unfortunately PET scan after the salvage chemo still shows activity on the left neck where it originally started. Doc has told us he would get radiation treatment to that area but hasn't  confirmed if it would be before or after the transplant.
We have read many papers showing the importance of complete response before stem cell transplant and so we are very  concerned by this news.

This is my second post on this sub. I am 25 years old and I had oesophageal cancer. Two weeks ago, I had a successful operation which the surgeons were delighted with. Hopefully it’s all gone. 

Now comes a tough challenge, relearning to eat. My whole stomach was removed, as with a small part of the bottom of my oesophagus. I’m still on pretty soft foods (soups, mashed potato), but last Thursday I was instructed to try something a bit harder. Food got stuck and I was vomiting quite a lot. Since then, soft food and soups continues to get “stuck” midway down my oesophagus. If I slurp a few sips of water then water will get stuck. I usually need to burp a few times to help it go down but it takes quite some time for it to pass. 

I’m quite worried as I’m losing weight, I’ve always been skinny but I’m dropping right now. I’m thankfully still in hospital and I’m getting an X-ray tomorrow. But I was wondering, has anyone had experience of this? Any tips or advice? Is this quite common?

43,StormyBA,1520257961,8261sd,4,"
Towards the end of September, a week or so after getting back from our Honeymoon my Mum was diagnosed with Cancer. This was of course a massive shock but we assumed and hoped for the best. By the end of October though, after more scans and tests it became very clear that it was rare, aggressive and unfixable. This has been especially hard as it was only last year that she hit 60 and took the big decision, along with dad to quit work and to start spending on holidays and having fun having spent their lives working their asses off.

But she was still fit at this point and was offered chemo to slow down the spread. The chemo was the strongest stuff going and it really knocked her for six. 

After her second treatment in late December she became very sick and was rushed to hospital. Some how she had picked up a major infection which, after chemo, is a big deal. The infection had even got into her bloodstream, which is as I understand it, is as bad as it can be. It was hard seeing her so sick, drifting in and out of consciousness and utterly lost in her mind much like someone with dimentia. We thought we where going to loose her then but luckily the doctors figured out what antibiotics she needed just at the right time and over the week improved enough to go home.

But I think by this point the damage from the chemo and infection had really taken its toll. Over the next few weeks her health slowly deteriorated. She lost lots of weight, struggled to eat and drink much and in the last few weeks got very bad.

She decided to go into the McMillian Hospice last Thursday gone and she passed away on the Saturday with as huddled round holding her hands, it was utterly heart braking and my dad who has been caring for her over the months leading up to it has been hardest hit. We have been doing what we can to be there for him but feels like there is nothing we can really do.

I'm finding it hard to remember the healthy times after the vivid image of the last hours sitting with her watching her die , suffering and gasping for air. She was not really mum, so weak, thin and lost struggling to hold on.

So yea, life has been a bit of a struggle the last 6 months and mostly definitely an awful start to married life.

History of thyroid cancer , total thyroidectomy and rai ten years ago. Also had fibrosarcoma with wide excision on left neck at the same time. 

I get pain in my throat on my trachea left side sort of at 7 o clock point, while sleeping. It wakes me up and keeps me awake.  I have swollen lymph nodes 

The weird part is as long as I am alert and I have awake level breathing, the pain is reduced and sort of less almost nonexistent. But if I start to doze off again, the pain picks up and makes my heart beat faster, sometimes I feel shaky. 
Eventually I can and do fall asleep due to sheer exhaustion

I have had a recent MRI to scan for return of thyroid cancer. Scan was clear but lots of swollen lymph nodes and shotty nodes. 
I also had an iodine scan showing nothing remarkable
Doc says wait for a year for next scan. In the meantime I have symptoms  and making work difficult. 
With layoffs in the horizon I can't afford the not be a shining star employee.  My health insurance and life insurance depends on being employed 

I am not sure where to turn anymore. I had this kind of pain before my thyroid surgery in fact all the fuss when it suddenly appeared is what led to the thyca discovery. No one definitively tied it to pain though. Pain subsides after rai

People are suggesting I stop linking it to thyca. I am fine with that but don't know who to consult. 

I already gave had sleep studies when this happened prior to mg cancer diagnosis a decade ago.
They gave me Anti anxiety medication, made no difference and generally messed with me. But Radioactive iodine ablation was what did  the trick. After RAI this weird pain and palpitations in neck and heart etc stopped cold. Now it's back

61,thebaziel,1520139437,81vpfd,26,"Hi folks,

So, after noticing a swollen lymph node above my left collarbone about a month ago, I've been sent to a ears nose and throat specialist who ordered a CT and a needle biopsy, and they found out I have Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I had no other symptoms. Edited to add: PET scan is Monday, and first meeting with the oncologist/hematologist is Tuesday.

So far, I am doing a good job latching on to the fact that I have great odds of recovery, even before you take into account that I am fairly young and otherwise healthy, live in a cancer research Mecca, and got diagnosed very quickly as soon as I noticed anything. I'm really convinced I'm going to beat this, and the statistics seem to back me up. (Maybe I'm a little in denial, but if I can just stay in denial until I start seeing progress on my scans, that seems great.)

I've got a lot of question about chemo (I'm assuming at this point I'll be on 6 months of ABVD because that seems to be what people do overwhelmingly). I know everyone is different, but just trying to get a feel for what the range of experiences is and what's most common, while I still have some time to prepare.

1. Working: I'm a programmer, it's the most physically undemanding job there is with flexible hours and work from home privileges, but pretty mentally demanding. Folks with similar jobs, were you able to work through chemo? Part time? Were you able to come into the office? I'm talking with my job about whether temporary disability could be split up into chunks, so I could use it every other week on the week of my chemo treatment, then work a week. Has anyone tried this, or had similar accommodations to keep working part time? Has anyone been able to keep working full time?

2. Immune system: I haven't seen a lot of posts about this, but a friend of a friend I talked to said his immune system was completely shot, like can't leave the house without a mask. I'm just trying to get a feel of what the chances are my immune system will get so bad I'll be almost housebound, or unable to go to the office even if I feel well enough. Could you go to parties while you were on chemo? Go out to dinner with friends? Go see a movie? Go to the grocery store? Snuggle your pets with your face?

3. Nausea: Some people seem to have anti-nausea meds figured out and working for them. How common is that? Would I have to be very lucky to be one of those people, or very unlucky to not be one of them?

4. Chemo brain: As I mentioned, I'm a programmer, and make my living off my brain. I don't have any sense of how common this is, or how devastating, and I'd love to hear that the accounts of people not bouncing back from it are the exception not the rule. I already have ADHD, so the idea of something just slipping out of my brain is already too familiar. On the other hand, if that got worse, but when I could focus I could still think about things at the same depth, that wouldn't be so bad. I'd be very interested to hear from anyone in a similar line of work.

5. Is there anything advice you wish you'd gotten for practical things to do to prepare?

73,Kheled-Zaram,1520098198,81rjoj,31,"Medical industry rant here.

I have chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has been mercifully non-aggressive until recently, when I had to have a catscan because it feels like I’m growing a pair of ovaries (I’m a guy.)

Because of this I had to have a blood test, and because my doctor is 50 miles away (and on vacation) his office said I could get it done near where I live at a certain large corporate diagnostic clinic.

So I do the test Friday – typically it takes a few hours to get the results, and in my case all I care about is my white blood cell count.

So the lab has an online portal, and of course I go online to get my results.

The system tells me I can’t see the results until I have talked to the doctor about them.
Fucking doctor is on vacation for two weeks.

I can probably (I hope) get the results from his office next week, but it’s just infuriating to know the data is available, but not to me.

I’ve been diagnosed for three years, and I know from the scan that I have external iliac node 2 swelling, which means bone marrow biopsy and then chemo or some other treatment.

I don’t need some fucking doctor or anyone else to hold my hand to receive this information.

I hate cancer, but I hate the healthcare industry almost as much.

I apologize for the rant, and I pay respect to all of you are dealing with much more serious problems.

TLDR: OP is pissed at healthcare industry and probably should have posted in r/angrytyping.

Today she went into the hospital for the third time in a couple months for basically 'unknown fever, likely caused by some infection'. I'm at home  and not there because there are times I have to decide if being the husband to her or dad to the kids is more important *right now*.

So now I'm not sleeping, feeling guilty for not being there, terrified of the upcoming decision we have of picking which experimental treatment she is going to try next and anticipating the banal pain of needing to care and be there for a couple of energetic kids after having a restless night.

89,joshingkatie,1520020827,81hgy3,15,"Hello,

I am curious if there are any cancer centers that are more focused on personalized medicine and the absolute best outcome for their patients.  The treatment center where my wife is at seems to like ""targeted"" therapies, where they do partial genome sequencing, identify mutations and then try drugs that are known to work against them.  It is marketed as ""personalized medicine"", but it is kinda not.  Their information is based on what's known to work on a general population of individuals with a given mutation, rather than how cancer works in an individual person.  Her current treatment regimen seems like a great idea in theory, but here's what is happening in practice:

1. The doctors come up with what in their minds will work the best.
2. They try it on the patient.
3. A month goes by and then they do a scan. 
4. If it does't work go to step 6.
5. It works for a few months, cancer eventually evolves drug resistance.
6. If there are treatment options that the patient can still tolerate, go to step 1.
7. Patient is out of options, try referring to someone else.

What I would have like to see is that, instead of using my wife as a defacto guinea pig, form a lineup of drugs they think they will work and then test them on cell cultures derived from her actual tumors.  Then rank their proposed treatments by what's proven to be most effective on them.  They could test multiple drugs in parallel, so there's no waiting a month to determine how well it works.  Sure the drug might not work when actually infused into her body, it's far more likely this way.  To me, this would be actual personalized medicine because now it's easy to discover what actually works (not just correlated across a population) on the individual patient.  I asked her doctor if anyone did this and he said ""It's a great idea, but you have to go to private, expensive facilities that do that.""  Apparently leaving me to infer that they're not going to proceed that way.

My wife's doctors are well intentioned, but they keep blowing time she doesn't have.  The last trial she was on had to go 2 1/2 months before the first scan and her cancer has grown over 30%.  They are now trying a different drug which works on the same metabolic pathway as one that's already been proven ineffective- and want to wait another month to see if it works.

What facility would approach cancer the way I mentioned to her doctors?  I realize people might be avoiding this approach to reduce selection bias in their studies, but what I really care about most is my wife's well-being.

91,BelgianBillie,1520018156,81gywm,17,"Hey everyone,

So, i am still here and feeling good. I had a Auto SCT in September 2017 (hodgkins stage III) and was in CR prior. At the 3 months mark i had a scan and it was rated deauville 2 with some very slight uptake 1-2 in the chest.

Now i did another scan at 7 months and the results are still Deauville 2, but they are now saying i have 3.7 uptake in a node in the neck, up from 2.5 in the previous scan (7mm node) and the chest one has shrunk a bit and is slightly lighter uptake 2.5, down from 3.1. There is some very slight uptake elsehwere in the chest, but unchanged from the previous scan.

I want to know what people make of this. I dont understand how they could look back at the previous scan and say all these nodes were lighting up. Back at the time they told me nothing in the neck and very slight uptake in the chest. now they are saying it was actually 2.5 already in the neck...

3.7 sounds high, but its technically below my liver base of 4.9, and the same as my bloodpool... so im borderline deauville 2, not 3.

My onc says everything is fine and not to worry... but it doesnt seem like that to me. He wants to wait 6-12 months now to rescan... i dont agree at all! I say we try to biopsy the neck one and do another scan in a month.

92,thelemonx,1520017925,81gxcq,18,"Glioblastoma Multiform is a horrific disease that quickly kills almost everyone who gets it.  Back at the end of November my oncologist gave me my prognosis, ""12-14 Months"".  I told him I wasn't going to die from this.

A week ago yesterday, I had my post-treatment MRI.  GBM is so aggressive, that the goal of chemo/radiation treatment is to slow down the cancer's grownth.  Mine didn't grow at all!!  This is even more exciting because I didn't get started with chemo and radiation until a month after my initial surgery.

In addition to not growing, even with a month where it should have grown like crazy, the tumor is mostly dead!!  

Yesterday, I got started with a new treatment, [Tumor Treatment Fields](http://www.onclive.com/conference-coverage/aacr-2017/tumor-treating-fields-substantially-improve-survival-in-gbm), which is a set of electrodes that I wear on my head all day, and it zaps the cancer as it tries to grow.

I'll also start my new round of chemotherapy as soon as the pills get to me.  It's going to be a lot bigger dose than my first round.  Between the TTF and chemo, I really believe my cancer will finish dying soon.  

I just want everyone reading this, to stay positive.  I wasn't supposed to live long, I stayed positive, now I will live.  My radiation oncologist told me he's seen patient attitude change prognosis many times.  He's seen people who should have lived, that had a poor attitude, and just gave up, who died quickly.  He's seen people who should have died quickly, who kept positive, who beat their cancer, and lived.  Personally, I watched my grandpa give up when he was diagnosed, and he died extremely quickly.  Long before I was born, my grandma was told she'd be dead in a year, she stayed positive and fought it, and she's still here almost 60 years later.

It is still the early stages of figuring out what is going on as she is poked and examined on a daily bases.

Or how much time he has left. It has metastized to bones, brain, liver and kidney. He was in hospital until last week but is now at home lying in bed. He has no energy at all, so the planned chemotherapy didn't even start. Now nothing can be done other than palliative care. It's been 3 days he didnt drink or eat anything (he didnt eat much before that either). He hasn't been on the toilet for a week now. He's lying in bed all day. He doesn't have the power to even talk.
And everytime I ask him if he wants something to eat, he gets really angry and tells me that all he wants is to die. He is and always was a really stubborn person.

 My family got the news about my dads Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma diagnosis (Diffuse Large B Cell) the day after Christmas. He was admitted to inpatient treatment 12/27 -2/1. He was there for almost 5 weeks. (He is doing the Magrath Chemo Regimen.) He went back 2/14 and was there for almost 3 weeks. He is currently home before he goes back for what will hopefully be his LAST inpatient round! 

On top of being 77, my father has always been stubborn and it has only gotten worse with the cancer and chemo. Our biggest obstacle right now is his appetite. He complains a lot about bowel movements (either stocked up or diarrhea) and has no appetite or cravings. We get frustrated with him because he isn't experiencing any nausea but he is not eating very much anyway. At 5'11 he is only weighing 150ish lbs. We had an appt. with his Hematologist yesterday and he told him, you need to recover so that we can do our last round of Chemo. 

Anyone have any advice? Tips? Experience? 

My father is one of the smartest men I've ever met but he's complaining about being weak.. I keep telling him to stop being so hard on himself.. but I also tell him how can he expect to have any energy if he isn't consuming much? He was doing so well last week but after some diarrhea this past weekend and not eating much, he's just falling in and out sleep and takes a while to form complete sentences.

bit confused-- wonder if anyone has experience with the following:

my dad has been fighting esophageal cancer for the past 8 months....his primary tumour is completely gone thanks to radiation but he has nodes in the lung lining which has caused malignant pleural effusion. was on immunotherapy (keytruda) however he is basically wasting away and so they have decided it is time for hospice care, as his body is too weak for additional treatment. Last week we were told the chemo he had been on prior to switching to immunotherapy seemed to have been working a bit (slowly), or at least there was not new growth, things weren't getting worse,  but he's been so fatigued that he just can't handle any treatments anymore.

Apparently his blood tests and heart are still working fine, the wasting is likely cachexia. I know there isn't really anything that targets that (i have been googling A LOT), and I also know that this is not a going to totally go away, but if his bloods and heart are still in good shape, what can we do to get him stronger? The doctors would be willing to start treatment again if his body could take it. 

I am prepared for the answer to be no, and this is the end, but I would not be able to live with myself if we haven't exhausted every single option.

One of the latest technological advancement in the field of cancer treatment may soon revolutionize the standards course of treatment for breast cancer patients.
Chemotherapy may now not be the only answer for women battling breast cancer. A team of researchers in the UK have now come up with a computer algorithm that can predict whether breast cancer is likely to spread to other organs in the future. This test is specially tailored for patients in whom breast cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.
It inspects and understands 40 different cell patterns and deduces if the cancer is likely to spread to other areas of the body. Most breast cancer deaths happen because cancer spreads to other organs such as lungs and liver.

My father who is 68 years old just had a colonoscopy last week. Polyps were removed and he had mris which showed a polyp was malignant. I believe it’s still in the early stages. He will be starting 6 weeks of chemo soon and has the option for either a chest port or pills, depending on what Medicare will cover. He can do either treatment at home apparently.

A little bit of background: My grandmother, his mom, had it in her late 70’s and polyps were removed and she survived it (but 8 years later had breast cancer and it spread). My dad has a BMI of about 24. Eating wise, he ate vegetarian for a length of time (as did my grandma) but started eating more red meat and and simple carbs over time. He was not an athlete of course but did go for many walks and worked doing some manual labor having owned a contracting company, so id say he’s moderately active. My only concern is that he drank a lot of whiskey/cognac and at one point smoked cigarettes for several years. 

This is all new to me as my dad means the world to me and I want to do everything in my power to get him to a point of healing. My parents are married and my mom tries her best but she doesn’t drive and has her own shit going on with mental health and minor health issues like heartburn and allergies.

I am welcome to any and all tips, suggestions, experiences, and other such things. I’m super scared and trying to be positive and strong.

Two weeks ago, she was hospitalized for vomiting blood. She has since been discharged and is receiving hospice care out of home. The doctors came back and said they believe that the TPN may have been helping the cancer grow. After this week, she has decided to discontinue the use of the TPN.

157,Newbigin,1520856677,83uhbj,2,"For some time now, I thought about writing here and already left a short note several months ago. By now My life has changed quite a bit and I thought some people with similar experiences might be interested. I have come to terms with my situation and don't write for sympathy. If you want to ask me anything, just go ahead. Don't be shy.

After I experienced different strange symptoms like heartburn and retching, I was diagnosed two years ago with esophagus cancer at the cardia (AEG II, uT3N2Mx). That's a pretty high stage, but at least no far reaching metastasis could be discovered.

The first attempt in treatment was to remove the tumor surgically combined with 6 adjuvant and 6 neo-adjuvant cycles of chemotherapy. As a scheme FLOT was chosen. It's a very strong chemo, but being in good overall health with only 43 years of age, this seemed to be possible. But even then, after 9 cycles we had to go back to FLO, because I had massive side effects. (Don't care about my hair, my fingers started to shake - which could become permanent). The operation went as planned and my stomach was (fully) removed. Till the end of the end of 2016, it seamed I had completely recovered and even regained weight.

A year ago in a routine check, some cells around the anastomosis (the new created connection of esophagus and colon) where discovered to be malignant. I was set up for a new surgery but the operation had to be canceled ""midway"". After the surgeon opened my abdomen, he discovered that the peritoneum was widely infected and he did not want to risk the contamination of my otherwise clean thoracic cavity. So we switched for a combined radio-chemo-therapy. This went more or less well, until my burned esophagus refused to take in any more. It started with certain spices and ended with simple tab water. So after 5 days without eating or drinking, I was hospitalized and given parenteral nutrition. So, again I survived, but my port got infected and had to be removed.

The last step was then to treat the peritoneal cancer itself. I went to a clinic that is specialized in this kind of tumors and the decided, that it was to diffuse for a HIPEC treatment, but offered a new invented PIPAC that showed promising results instead. In my case it didn't. The Peritoneal index went up from 23 to 39, which means (in the later case) a complete coverage with tumor. So last week, this treatment was also terminated.

At this moment, I am not aware of any other promising treatments  I receive pain killers and try not to loose any more weight. 

For those inclined to spirituality: I got a prophecy, that my time has not yet come. So I live on prayer and the search for meaning in my life.

My brother is a fighter and is a inspiration to so many. The doctors say he has days if not hours to live, but I just wanted to share his brief story to maybe inspire those and their families who have come before him, and those who will certainly follow after him in the fight against this horrible disease.

We were told we caught it early enough. His prostate was removed and after some time he underwent another scan. It spread. They didn’t catch it. The surgery wasn’t what we wanted it to be. The oncologist said his tests and scans still showed cancer in his body, but they couldn’t find it. They just knew it wasn’t in the lymph nodes. After another consultation and a scan, they found 4 very tiny dots on his spine in the pictures. They’ve been biopsies as of last week. Come Thursday this week we’ll know if they’re mets or an unrelated symptom of his sarcoid. We’re not hopeful. Today he had a talk with me about watching my mother, about how financially we’re going to be well taken care of without him, but he peppered the entire talk with the all the doctors promising a window of anywhere from 2 to 15 years left. After the biopsy comes back we’ll know if it’s 2, 5, 10, or however many. 

I’m just writing this to vent and cope. I’m scared and sad and I don’t want to lose him. I don’t want to lose him.

I just got my 6 month Tg assay back and unfortunately it's elevated from last time, it was 0.3 now it's 0.6.

Almost exactly a year ago I had a value of 1.2. My endocrinologist thought that it seemed a bit high, so I was retested with a different assay (mass-spec). The second assay returned a value of less than 0.4, so I've had at least one issue with this assay in the past. I've tested at 0.3 each time since.

Of course there's a possibility that this just means that I'm having a recurrence. And while I realize that that's a definite possibility, the past erroneous test is giving me a little hope that this may be an error too. I'm getting retested, but I was curious how common these testing errors are, and if anyone has ever experienced one?

179,StoicHobo,1520665810,83dozy,5,"My grandparents raised me since birth, and my grandmother will always be my true mother. She was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer last November. She had breast cancer before back in 2009, but now it had come back and spread to her bones, liver, and lungs. She had been battling with pneumonia prior to her diagnosis, and an eventual trip to the ER is when they discovered it.

There are a million thoughts racing through my head right now. I have so many regrets and so many things I wish I had done differently.

She never fully recovered during her first hospital stay with the pneumonia. Then, with every subsequent stay afterwards, when it seemed like she was finally getting better, a new infection would take hold or the pneumonia would return. She would be out of the hospital for a week or so before she was right back in. As a result, she was only able to receive a few of her cancer treatments that we hoped were going to prolong her life.

She soon stopped consistently eating and drinking, and she refused to do therapy. I got so angry with her during this time. I yelled at her and begged and pleaded with her. I kept telling her that she has to get better, so she can get her treatments. I would get so frustrated with her that I would leave the hospital without telling her I loved her when she told me she loved me. I thought that she wasn't fighting. I thought she had given up. I didn't realize that her body was already dying.

Eventually, it got to point where the doctors said there was nothing more they could do and that hospice was the next step. I didn't want to hear it or believe it. I was still holding onto the idea that she could keep getting treated and live longer.

She was discharged for the final time from the hospital this past Wednesday to home hospice. Thursday she was put on 24 hour care after she complained of intolerable pain, and we learned that her kidneys were failing. Then, Friday afternoon she passed away.

I left Friday morning to go meet with a student I am mentoring as part of a program through my college. Before I left, her orders had been changed to give her morphine every hour as she requested it, but there were no orders for when to give it to her in the event that she was unable to request it if she was sleeping. The nurse who was currently looking after her said she was just going to give it to her every hour if she was sleeping. I asked if my grandmother could handle it, and she said yes, because she was going to give her half her regular dose. I said alright let's keep doing that until her primary nurse gets here to setup a regular schedule for the morphine. I can't get the thought out of my head that that decision is the reason she died Friday. That all I had to do was just call the hospice number and ask them how we should handle it.

I didn't make it in time to say goodbye to my grandma. I never got to say goodbye to her the way I wanted to. I wasted all the time I had when she was still herself and not constantly medicated. I hate myself for not telling her how much I love her all those times she told me. I'm never going to be able to hug her again, I'm never going to be able to hear her say she loves me again, and I'm never going to be able to tell her I love her again.",My grandmother died,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/83dozy/my_grandmother_died/,1520687410.0,2018-03-10 01:10:10
180,photonstravellight,1520664118,83dki1,5,"But somewhat about cancer. I have an amazing dog. She’s my best friend (don’t tell my roommate). She’s a yellow lab and she’s my sidekick. My constant companion, my partner in crime. Before cancer I ran track, and she was my running partner. She made sure I didn’t sleep through my alarm, and she’s being me my running shoes in the morning. Kayaking, stand up paddle boarding, camping, snowboarding, movie nights, road trips- you name it, she’s done it with me. We’ve shared sleeping bags and sandwiches, ice cream cones and nights under the stars. Miles and miles of roads and hiking trails. She sleeps under my desk when I’m on the computer, she follows me from room to room, she has to be touching me all night and usually sleeps with her head on my back (or her whole body- she’s not picky). She’s stolen countless things off the counter, because she’s a lab, and also a black hole/garbage disposal. She once ate a fresh butterscotch pie my roommate made. Whole. No shame. Had pie filling all over her face. 

When I’m sick from chemo she brings me her toys and lays with me, tucks her prized possessions right up next to me and waits for them to make me feel better. When I have to go to the hospital for in-patient treatments, my roommate tells me she camps the front door. For days. Or she stands on the couch with her head resting on the back, just staring at the door. And this kills me, because there’s a more than likely chance she’s going to outlive me. And I have no way to explain to her that I haven’t just abandoned her. That I didn’t decide to get up one day and just leave her behind. 

I’m not worried about her welfare. My roommate, who has been my absolute closest friend since we were in kindergarten- I trust her with my life- is going to be keeping her (she’s lived with me with my roommate and my roommate’s german shepherd most of her life) and even if she couldn’t my brother would, or my sisters, my parents. My family are dog people. My roommate is dog people. She’ll be cared for in the spoiled manner to which she’s become accustomed. But, she’s never had an attachment to another person. When my roommate and I travel, my dog spends the time sitting at the door of whoever she’s staying with until I get back. No matter how many weeks I’m gone. I promised her I would take care of her for her entire life, no matter how many years that was or how old and senile she got. It crushes me to think that she’s going to wonder where I went. Why I never came back. And it’s not something I can ever explain to her. I’m going to have to abandon my best friend and she’ll never know that it was the last thing I wanted to have happen.

My sister has ovarian cancer due to a BRCA1 mutation, she was in remission until December 2017 and had to resume her treatment. A month ago she had an horrible allergic reaction to carboplatin: not being able to breathe, face went all red. It was super scary but she made it. Two days ago it was chemo time again and it was worse, even when she had the carboplatin due for 1:30 (usually it takes 1 hour). On top of the previous signs, she had an awful headache, couldn't walk and her hands were turning yellow. She was rushed to the ER and doctors managed to stabilize her but it was even more scary than the previous time. So we went to her oncologist and he decided to finally suspend the chemo but now says that she needs to be ""clean"" in order to receive a biological treatment. Is this true? We consulted her gynecologist and he said he had a colleague that went through biological treatment without being NED.

204,ravenpuffclaw,1520545969,831cpc,4,"Hi guys. My family got some bad news yesterday that my mom's colon cancer may have come back, this time in her liver. She had stage IIa adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon a year and a half ago. They were able to remove the whole tumor from her colon with surgery. They have monitored her CEA labs since then. In October they seemed to be trending up and my mom had a colonoscopy. They found some benign polyps but no other problems. They repeated the CEA in February and it was outside of the reference range. It took 2 weeks for her doctor to order a CT scan and she just got the results yesterday. There's an abnormal finding in the liver but they need further imaging to determine what it is. (""Vague hypodensities in the liver parenchyma are new from the previous CT raising the concern for metastatic disease given the recent trending elevation of CEA"")

We are very concerned her cancer metastasized into the liver. My understanding is that this would be stage IV cancer. I am terrified and I feel like every second going by where this is not getting treated worsens her prognosis. Her insurance network changed this year so she had to be referred to a new oncologist. I called them yesterday and their first opening is in 2 weeks. She will have to see them for a consult and then they will order imaging after that. My gut says call every oncologist in the area and see if I can get her in sooner. I'm wondering how long it normally takes to get in to an oncologist. Is this just the normal wait? Am I overreacting? Do I just need to chill out and be patient? Any advice is appreciated. I had hoped to never have to post on this sub after they told us they removed the whole tumor.

215,packfan93,1521687476,868dkj,3,"Hi everyone. I am a healthy 25 year old male. About 2 weeks back, I noticed a half-marble sized lump about an inch under my left ear. It felt like a bug bite, so I didn't think much of it. It was not painful at the time. Now, the lump seems more noticeable, maybe because I'm thinking about it more. It is tender to the touch and I am able to move it around. I also noticed a bump on the bottom left half of my jaw that has similar characteristics, but is not as pronounced. Looking at a lymph node diagram, these are seem to be tonsillar and submandibular nodes.
Regarding the nodes, I feel like they change sizes throughout the day. They sometimes seem flattened out, but a few minutes later there will be a noticeable bulge.
I brought my concern to my primary physician today and he said that they are definitely more prominent than normal. He ran a complete blood count and mono test, all results coming back within normal limits. These same lymph nodes were inflamed a few years back, but my white blood cell count was high (around 20,000). A specialist did an ultrasound on them and did not seem concerned whatsoever. He told me that some lymph nodes don't completely go back to normal after a bad infection. I have an appointment with an ENT specialist tomorrow, so hopefully I will get some sort of answer.
Does this seem like anything to be concerned about? Besides the palpable nodes and pain, I am feeling healthier than I ever have. I have not been sick for the past year, so enlargement caused by infection is not likely. I know I am unable to get a diagnosis on here, but my anxiety is shooting through the roof so any words are appreciated.

His PCP found something in his routine blood work, repeated the blood work, sent him to have an ultrasound, then a CT scan. Still didn’t know what was going on but finally, a few months later, referred him to an oncologist. The oncologist then sent him for another CT and more blood work. We were finally given the diagnosis about a month ago now. No stage was given. The oncologist sounded optimistic, saying that it was only one tumor. However, that tumor is the largest  seen throughout their career, 6 inches, and it is wrapped around his inferior vena cava. So surgery is an unlikely treatment option. The oncologist then wanted to refer him to a transplant specialist to be evaluated and another doctor who specializes in targeted chemo therapy. 

We saw the transplant specialist last week and this doctor was down right rude. He was in a rush because he’d been held up with other patients at the hospital. Allowed no opportunity for questions or even any explanations, despite mentioning “multiple tumors” and “18 cm” on the main tumor. Entirely different information than what his oncologist gave us. Never made any mention of transplant. Only that he is not a candidate for chemo therapy because “we don’t treat liver cancer with chemo therapy” and there is nothing he can do, but he would take his case before the liver board to see if they could come up with anything and “it might be tomorrow before you get a call from us”. It has now been a week with no word. 

The doctor who specializes in targeted treatment will not see my dad until he has another ultrasound done to see if the tumor has grown. He was supposed to see that doctor this week however, we’ve learned his ultrasound has been put on hold but they could not tell us why there is a hold on it or even who put it on hold.  

Like I mentioned the the title, I feel like they are playing hot potato with him. Both my parents are scared and I am supremely pissed off. We are sitting on our hands with nothing to do but watch him decline. Which he appears to be doing rapidly. He has lost a significant amount of weight since his diagnosis and his abdomen is now noticeably distended. I am concerned to say the least. My mother refuses to accept a lot of this and my dad isn’t completely forthcoming with all of his symptoms.

232,BrerBunny,1521609913,85zpjb,9,"TLDR: Try Salagen if you have dry mouth

Hi all!
I’m posting to share my experience with a new prescription that I finally found out about after months of reading and convincing my doctor and dentist. I am a metastatic thyroid cancer patient and three years ago I was treated with a VERY high dose of radioactive iodine (307mCi). The treatment was relatively effective (I’m having another one this Friday to finish off what’s left) but my salivary glands were completely wrecked by it. For three years I suffered from severe tooth decay as well as an inability to eat anything without downing several glasses of water.

My doctors all recommended biotene and dry mouth lozenges (as if I hadn’t already been using those products) and said that nothing else could be done. I decided to take matters into my own hands and started researching dry mouth treatments and prescriptions. After finding my way into a forum for patients suffering from Sjogrens Syndrome, I came across a medication called Salagen. Salagen is prescribed to Sjogrens sufferers to treat dry mouth and, after further reading, I found that some doctors used it to help patients who had salivary gland damage from radiation treatments.

After a week of repeatedly calling my doctor, I was able to convince him to prescribe the medication even though he had never heard of it. I went with the generic version (it’s cheaper and equally as effective).

Long story short, it works. Tonight I was able to eat dinner with only one glass of water. My mouth is still not as wet as it should be, but it’s not the bone dry desert that it’s been for the past three years. 

I have many friends who are suffering from dry mouth due to radiation treatments, and I’m sure many here are as well. I just wanted to pass this info along to anyone who is looking for ways to address it. I would have really benefited from knowing about this when I first started treatment.

251,QuotidianNapper,1521531905,85qxzq,17,"My MIL had a rare thyroid cancer last year and had her thyroid removed. She recovered, struggled a lot with getting the correct thyroid medication dose, but then, after several months, started to feel better. The surgeon even gave her a note that said ""Go enjoy your life, you will not die of cancer.""

This year she was diagnosed with a rare MDS (blood) cancer. The doctors have all of the markers in her blood stabilized right now and she says she feels ""fine"" because before she was feeling awful. She's even gone back to work. 

The doctor told her she has about a year and a half because eventually the cancer will ramp back up, and it usually happens quickly and suddenly. The doctors want her to do chemo and possibly use her son for a 50% stem cell match (they haven't been able to find any other better match) and blood transfusion. She would be hospitalized and then in isolation for months with the likelihood of her surviving the procedure at about 30%. Then she maybe gets a 5 year life-extension with the possibility of the cancer coming back and then they cannot treat it at all because she will ""too old"" (the doctors will only do the procedure on someone less than 75yo) and she will have a very weak immune system. The doctors also won't do the stem cell and transfusion treatment once the cancer ""ramps back up"" again because she will be ""too weak,"" so they would like her to make a decision soon.

She seems to be leaning towards not doing any treatment for many reasons. One reason is she thinks the doctors are trying to rush her into treatment bc she thinks she is an ""experiment"" to them, since her MDS is rare and they've been very interested in her.  She also doesn't seem to like the doctors' bedside manners. 

She has, understandably, concerns about the possibility of having a miserable next several months undergoing the treatment and then not surviving. Her feelings about not doing the treatment are only being reinforced since right now she feels ""fine."" 

I also talked to her about her trying to do anything that she would like to do while she still feels okay. Just a few days ago she was talking about how she wanted to do things (travel mostly)  but that she can't because she has to see the doctor every few weeks and she is scared that at any moment she will start feeling incapacitated again. So, today, once she got the news that there are no donor matches, she said there isn't anything she wants to do except make it to her 50th wedding anniversary and see the last installment of Star Wars, but she doesn't believe she'll make it to either of those, so ""it doesn't matter."" 

Her husband, son, and I want her to go to the leading MDS doctors in the country, just to get a second opinion and maybe find a doctor she likes, even if she decides not to do any treatment. She doesn't seem interested in that option all that much either. It's her body and we want her to do what she feels will be best for her, but we just want to make sure she has all the information we can get her before she makes her final decision.

We all will do whatever we need to do to support and care for her, but we're also worried that she could regret not taking a chance at treatment...thank you for reading. 



TL;DR: Do any of you have experience with a someone that did not choose to do treatment and they lost their battle within the predicted amount of time? Did they ever express regret about not doing treatment near the end?

My mom (54) felt something under her armpit right breast. Went in for mammogram couple weeks later. Doctors saw a tumor approximately 1.4 cm they said. They ordered a biopsy right away. After a week doctor called my mother and broke the horrible news to her. The tumor is hormone positive (estrogen and progesterone positive). Also the lymph node was cancerous as well. Days later we met with the oncologist and she said that doctor told her at the time of the biopsy he felt tumor was bigger than 1.4 cm. It's more like 4-5 cm... They performed a CT scan and bone scan to check if it has spreaded anywhere else. My whole family and I are all in fear, although I'm trying to keep everyone positive and worry free but it's still pretty hard on us because it's first in family... We have a meeting with doctor and oncologist this week. I want to be prepared and ask the right questions such as treatments and questions about this cancer in general. Im willing to do anything to help out my mom. I started researching all kinds of different diets... (Alkaline, low asparagine diets...) She's not overweight or anything but like I said any help I can provide for her and help her beat this!! Please help me, help her!! 

Update: 02/25/18 // The oncologist called us and said that according to the CT scan, everything looks clear (Thank God) but the bone test showed one suspecious area (left iliac pelvis). Oncologist recommended MRI just to double check on that. She also hinted that the doctor would like to start with hormone pill therapy to shrink the tumor for about 3-6 months then surgery and remove it.

Update: 03/10/18 // My mom did another MRI for both breasts. Tumor showed to be bigger. (8 cm) also MRI on the pelvis. Still can't tell if it's cancer or not. Also bone test was done check on density of bones.

Update: 03/19/18 // Oncologist called again. She said after reviewing my moms case with different doctors at the meeting this time, it was suggested to do chemotherapy instead of the pills because they're not still sure if the left iliac pelvis is cancer or not... Three different tests and they still not sure... I told her that were looking for second opinion from different hospital and doctor...

I have done my due diligence and looked through previous iterations of this question, but I'm hoping for some more long-term ideas. My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer a few months ago and his decline has been very fast.

Lemon pie seems to be a favorite, but I feel bad having him subsist off that alone. 

He is a very picky eater--even before his diagnosis he refused to eat anything with peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, leeks, chives, and any spice that could possibly be construed as ""ethnic"" (apologies for the non-PC terminology).

288,hokiethug,1521316085,8566jk,8,"My mom wrote this to my sister and I today.  She has terminal liver cancer.  If anyone else is in this situation maybe this will help you feel a bit better:


I don’t specifically remember being 50 much less 47. But I can say without a doubt I would love to be either of those ages again. I would have been 50 in 1992, both of you would have been out of college and working, dad either working or between jobs, and I would have been climbing my way up the corporate ladder at HomeCall. After 75 years of a varied life, to say the least, one would think I could come up with some meaningful words of wisdom. There are lots of little things but I think you know them already; there are also lots of things I could tell you not to do but I think you know them already too. So, here are the top picks: 

The first advice to a 50 year old would have to be pay attention to your health. A functioning body can easily be taken for granted but as the years go by, things can start falling apart; some can be prevented or delayed by healthy livening, others cannot. So do what you can and don't stress about the 'what ifs.' Stress itself is damaging to one's health, as is worrying too much. 

Enjoy your family and your friends as much as you can and let them enjoy you; in the long run that's all that really counts. Staying in touch, if only with a few words, can make a difference in that person's day. Know that loving someone doesn't me you always have to agree.

Don't be too critical of others and don't worry about what others may think of you. Most people are doing the best they can or have a reason for acting the way they do. Don't let anyone else change you and what you know to be right. And always be kind; in the long run you will be glad you were. And don't be too hard on yourself.

Some of the best things happen in ""life after 50."" Be ready to enjoy them and fully embrace them. Marriages, relationships, grandchildren, new friends, travel, even grand-dogs. There is a saying about living each day as if it is your last; I understand the concept, but now that I am in a situation where the last day is drawing near, I can't say I like the saying. I would rather say to live your life the best you can and when there are moments that make you happy, be still for a few minutes, think about it, feel it, and absorb every level of the pleasure. As you know, I really enjoyed kayaking. Sometimes I would just lean back and drift with the current, enjoying the beauty of the surroundings. It was great! But now that I know how to meditate, when I am kayaking mentally, I not only see the beauty, but feel the breeze on my face, hear the leaves rustling and water splashing on the kayak, see the reflection of the sky in the water or maybe grasses and fish in the water, or hear a few birds chirping. I am not just observing the moment, I am a part of the moment. Enjoy all of the moments you can! 

I suppose I could come up with a long list of things I wish I had made more time for in my life, but more time with family is the only one that really counts. I'll leave it at that.

Now the easy question - what did I discover in the last ten years that I wish I had discovered sooner? I wish I had known I had an artistic side that could be developed. I used to sew a lot but although I enjoyed it a little, it was mostly a financial necessity. The same with playing the piano, I enjoyed it a little but mostly it was just what girls were supposed to do when I was growing up. I enjoyed the various art classes I took in Romney and now of course really enjoy ceramics. Finding a hobby is easy for some people but not others. Mine came along as a fluke and totally surprised me. It's probably good that it came later in life when I'm able to be a little less critical of myself and just enjoy the process.

I hope some of this makes sense and will help you as you continue to live and grow and be a part of this world. I am so very proud of you both and of the partners you have each chosen; I am so proud of my grandchildren for who they are and all they have done and will do in the future. My love is endless!

Okay so backstory. Four (4) weeks ago I found a lump under my armpit. It was hard, fixed in place and didn't hurt. I watched to see if it would go away and it didn't. So I made an appointment with my GP.

When he examined it he found that it was coming off of breast tissue of my right breast and ordered a mammogram and ultrasound which I had Wednesday.

They found three lumps in my breast (not including what is under my arm) as well as my lymph nodes being enlarged. The only reason I know this is because I saw this on the ultrasound and asked the sonographer (sp?).

She showed the doctor my results and they recommended a CT Scan with Contrast and are sending me to a specialist.

I've called to try and get my results from the mammogram/ultra sound but they won't give them to me over the phone (which I understand).

I had the CT Scan today and see the specialist Tuesday.

301,Aalynia,1521231322,84yg43,18,"I cannot begin to describe how violently angry I am right now.

My father was diagnosed with Stage IV NSCLC in February 2015. He was given 6-12 months to live. Since then he has had (in order): two lines of chemo, radiation, immunotherapy, chemo, break from treatment, chemo, radiation, and then chemo again. He has a very fast growing cancer, which is why he’s been on so many treatments: everything is very successful for a few months, but then seems to stop working. We are at a point where his oncologist said “one last round of chemo or hospice.” Since I’m pregnant, and he wants to try to be around to meet his granddaughter, he said chemo.

EXCEPT THE INSURANCE WONT LET HIM.

Since he’s had 5 types of chemo they are flat out refusing any other forms. My parents are applying for Medicare but that still only covers 80% so they would be paying over $200 a week. They’re reaching out to the pharmaceutical company to see if they will help out. The cancer center has put in an appeal and his oncologist has called every day. My father has been in there a minimum of once a week for the past three years—every one there knows him well and the doctors and nurses are as pissed as we are.

I’m just so...I don’t even know the right word. I am in physical pain thinking about how the insurance company is basically deciding when it’s my father’s time to die. He knows he’s not going to be here forever—he’s not afraid to go—he just has one wish to make it to August to meet my daughter. And they are effectively taking that from him.

My mum has no history of cancer. About a month ago or so she developed a pain in her hip. It was quite severe and bothered her for several days, but went away after she started exercising. She also had a mild burning sensation in her spine which came and went. Just to be safe she decided to go to a neurologist. He said it's probably nothing serious, but told her to have an MRI of the spine just in case.

The MRI showed some kind of vertebral lesion in the thoracic spine. The doctor who had done the MRI said the evidence points towards it being malignant, but it could be simple vertebral sclerosis as well. She advised mum to have a CT scan and a bone scan done.

The following month was horrible. I researched ""vertebral metastases"" on the internet every day and cried my eyes out. I couldn't eat and hardly slept. I was so worried. I asked my mum to have a mammogram done as well as multiple ultrasounds of different organs. Everything came back clear. 

Then I remembered my friend's father is a radiologist who works in a clinic and does MRIs. I asked him for a second opinion. He showed the MRI to his colleagues and together they decided that it's 90% non-malignant sclerosis, but told us it's better to have a CT scan just to make sure. So my mum had a CT scan done as well. 

My friend's father referred us to a chief of medicine who specializes in radiology. He looked at the MRI and CT scan results and said he couldn't see anything malignant at all. Everything looked clear. My mum was so glad to hear it, and I was too, for a few hours. 

But I still cannot let this situation go. I don't understand why I can't find any MRI pictures of similar benign lesions on the internet. I read that MRI is more precise than a CT scan, which doesn't show bone marrow infiltration. I can't make myself eat properly and continue worrying about my mum. She is starting to become irritated with me. She refuses to have more tests, except for an MRI a year from now just to see if everything looks the same. But I'm so scared. What if she develops symptoms by then and it's too late? I don't understand what I should so. 

Everyone around me is so dismissive of my worries. They say they trust the chief of medicine and my friend's father. That I should calm down and be happy that my mum is alright. But I can't! I still think about it all the time.

Please help me. I don't know how to keep on living with this anxiety. I lost my godmother to leukemia three years ago and my uncle to renal cell cancer two years ago.

Just after Christmas he had another MRI which revealed the cancer having spread to other parts of his body (stage 4). Two weeks after that (January 2018) he started immunotherapy (every 2-3 weeks) but he had an awful reaction to the third or fourth treatment and developed encephalitis (swelling of the brain). He was admitted to a hospital in London at the start of February and has been there ever since (almost 40 days now). Two weeks ago the doctors found ""something"" on his lower spine and he started radiotherapy at the weekend.

30/m/complete remission for Hodgkins Lymphoma Stage 4B as of November 2017.

Doctors finally figured out what was ""waxing and wayning"" in my lungs since August - a fungal infection known as Aspergillosis.  My first PET scan after finishing my chemo regiment demonstrated no sign of cancer (great!) but a really HOT area in my lungs (nuuuuu!).

Here is some information if you wanted to read up on it:

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aspergillosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369619

I had my port flushed after meeting with the ""infectious disease"" doctor and one of the nurses mentioned that it was very likely that the chemo caused the issue, though I suppose we'll never know for sure.  I would've been about 1/2way through my treatment when the first lung issue showed up in August, so it makes sense that my immune system would have been drastically compromised.

At any rate, it sounds like this is something I can take some anti-fungal medicine for and it should go away on its own.

338,Chad_JH,1522243661,87rvy1,3,"One of my colleagues, who is like a parent to me, was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer about a year ago. By the time she got diagnosed she was really sick - she had lost heaps of weight, could barely eat, had a cough and bad back pain, had greyish coloured skin and was having night sweats. She also said when she moved her bowels it smelt like petrol. Her blood work several months before diagnosis showed abnormal liver function, high platelets and almost non-existent ferritin. By the time it was detected the tumour was very large and had spread to her liver, spine and apparently was in her blood vessels? That’s what she said. 

Anyway, so far she has had surgery for a colostomy bag to be put in and she did chemo and radiation. The radiation fractured her spine and eventually after almost a year on chemo it has been discontinued. She is now on monocular antibodies treatment. 

She won’t see me and hasn’t since she was diagnosed because she said it would make her too upset.I haven’t seen her since she was diagnosed a year ago. But we keep in contact through weekly text messages. 

• •• Can anyone please give me some more information on her treatments or direct me to good websites? I tried searching myself but became overwhelmed. I miss her a lot but I respect her decision of not wanting to see me. 

••• Also, for a whole year before she was diagnosed we got more and more concerned about her. First she started losing weight and we commented on it and I thought maybe she was on a diet (she was overweight before). But then she got skinnier and skinnier and I noticed she no longer ate at work. By this time, I was very worried. We all told her to see a doctor but she kept insisting the doctor said she was fine and that she just had gluten intolerance disease. 

But then her colouring started to change and she developed a cough. That’s when I just knew she had cancer. She said her doctor said it was irritable bowel syndrome. Anyway, then she said she was sweating profusely at night and her doctor knew about it and said it was strange. And she started having pain in her back and her personality became more anxious and a lot more “soft” than it used to be (she was known for being a hard ass at work). Her blood tests were all over the place three months before her diagnosis and then we found out she ended up going to emergency one night and then from then on she had tests organised which showed she had cancer.... 

Do you think she knew something was wrong? 
Why would she be sick for so long and then suddenly go to hospital? 
Is there anything I can do to support her? 
Why would her first doctor just pass it off as IBS? 


Are the treatments she’s having fairly standard? 


I know she isn’t blood related but I’ve known her since I was 10 years old and she is my rock. I call her Mum and she means the world to me and I just feel so helpless, but my feelings are nothing compared to what she must be feeling.

However, it's not in any vital organs- lungs or liver etc, mostly just around her abdomen and uterus. I live far away from her so for a long time while she was getting chemo I wasn't worried, until I talked to one of her doctors that said she has 6 months to live, 1 year if the treatment helps. However, she feels fine- she has no pain, she can live life normally, she's super optimistic---
This makes it really hard for me because I can't imagine she has months left to live when she looks/feels/acts fine. I wonder, is it possible that she could die unexpectedly without having obvious deterioration? How can they be saying 6 months and that she is out of options treatment-wise, when the only reason she was diagnosed was that her stomach was big (she looks pregnant but its just the tumors), no pain or other issues. I read some things about how you normally know when it's near the end, and I think that the cancer would first have to spread to vital organs for it to cause her death which would present obvious symptoms.

This is important to me since I live far away, and I would want to know about traveling to be with her (I can't do it indefinitely due to personal responsibilities but obviously can arrange to go see her near the end). She doesn't really believe her prognosis because she feels fine and I know doctors are not always correct about that but if she has 6 months left, I want to be prepared, especially if she could pass unexpectedly.

Overall, I feel great physically and mentally, but whenever it comes time for a recon scan, I get nervous and a little sad. It's like a reminder of everything that I went through, and sometimes it gets a little overwhelming. I am a positive person, which is a big reason why I was able to get through everything, but every time these scans come up I always tend to think the worst. I make it about the ""what if"", instead of concentrating on the fact that at this point, I have made it through my battle. I've tried to talk to my fiancé and some family about it, but they just don't understand this side of it. Don't get me wrong, they are all very supportive and I am very thankful for them, but they have not endured the actual battle we go through (although they go through their own battle as caregivers).

358,_-Kitsune-_,1522123591,87fiu2,2,"So, I had Papillary Thyroid Cancer at the age of 12 - 13. Extremely unusual for someone that age to get it, and I'm male on top of that. In general, it was basically super unlucky. Papillary Thyroid Cancer is, luckily, not terminal, but it is very tedious like many other forms of the disease. I had to go through biopsies, scans, surgery, diet without salt or dairy, and iodine radiation - all while in 8th grade during school time. 

This is where we get to now. I'm 15 now and attend a very studious high school which takes 2 years to complete instead of 4 - giving you a jump start on college. Meaning I have a lot of work. However, I just got word from my endocrinologist that I have high tumor markers. They originally said that I'd need to go back on that diet for about a week, then get scanned. After that, they called back to tell me make it 3 weeks instead. I'm 2 weeks in now, and I'm not gonna lie, I'm scared. I hate this diet so much; I'm a teenager with teenager dieting habits, but with this diet I can't have *any* iodized salt, processed food, dairy, or soy. And after this horrible thing is over, I have to redo a scan to see if i have gone out of remission and need to re-go through radiation. Radiation makes me miss a full week of school - massive amounts of homework - and I'm scared it may have spread farther than radiation can cut it.

Does anyone have any information or suggestions for me on how to get through this??

It showed uptake in that lymph and the one directly across from it in the groin area. The two appts were 3 weeks apart. He has now schedualed me for a surgical consult rather than just directly ordering a biopsy apparently which wont be for another 2 weeks, which then surgery would most likely be in yet another two weeks. I am a non-hodgkins survivor. I am on high doses of a medication that can provoke lymphoma (cyclosporine for autoimmune kidney disease) because my nephrologist decided it was worth the risk. This lymph node is nearly the size of my thumb now, hard, and immobile. 

It didnt take this long to get the biopsy done last time, they rushed it though, I might have had a CT but no PET of course (was through my GP) and it was a good thing because even with no other symptoms than the swollen lymph node I was stage 4. I wont, but I want to call them up and yell at someone to stop playing around. I know two people who have died because everything took forever either for insurance approval or long spaces between appts etc, and the cancer spread so fast.

A week and a half after my last chemo, I had another PET/CT. Everything was still negative except for a small spot on my lung. It had an SUV of 3.5. My doctor said he and several doctors are confident it’s just a lung infection. And that it would be EXTREMELY rare for anything to go to my lung during treatment when I really didn’t have much cancer to start. My doctor went ahead and removed my central line, which is also encouraging. And has said that the spot doesn’t have any characteristics of lymphoma in the lung.

(obligatory posting from mobile, and English is not my first language)

Yesterday my best friend was diagnosed with leukemia, it all happened really fast. We come from the same town and grew up together, before we both moved to the other side of the county about ten years ago. Her mother flew up yesterday and is with her now. Her boyfriend is (according to her mother) just crying all the time. When my friend called yesterday, we discussed that I wouldn't visit until after the weekend. It is a bit much now with everyone there and the diagnosis so fresh. She is young, strong and otherwise healthy so she is going to beat leukemias ass!

Right now I'm struggling to know what to do, her family all know to call if they need help with anything, but I don't want to bother them too much. I slept for about five hours, just waking up and not really knowing what to do with myself. I would appreciate some tips for how to keep myself busy when I'm not at work.

I already know that I'm going to have to keep her positive, and she loves dark humour. I promised myself that I won't cry in front of her, it's the last thing she needs.

It then came back in late 2016, and they took out his tibia and replaced it with a cadaver bone, as well as removed all the muscle tissue and replaced it with one of the muscles in his abdomen in early 2017. They found cancer once more, removed the leg entirely (above-the knee amputation), but at that point it was too late and it had spread to his lungs &amp; heart. They were planning on starting some radiation and chemo this month, but he has had health complications due to the cancer that have prevented it. The original timeline given in January was about six months with palliative care, and about 12 months with treatment.

He is currently in the hospital with a-fib (irregular heartbeat) and fluid-filled lungs. They are going to drain the fluid ASAP, but they can't do it without an ultrasound as there is a large tumour (possibly more than one) surrounding his heart and lungs, and the techs aren't back until Monday (it is Friday after 9pm here on the west coast of Canada).

Background: My mom was diagnosed with colon cancer back in December. Extremely painful stomach pains in October was misdiagnosed as appendicitis. Ultimately, a large 5 cm tumor was found during a colonoscopy. The tumor was removed and just this past Tuesday (March 20th, 2018), my mom started chemotherapy. I am currently 17 years old (junior in high school). 
When I was in 8th grade, my father had passed away due to an accident. It didn't bother me much since my parents were divorced and so my life didn't change as dramatically. I feel that whenever I have bad events happen to me, I can try to put it in the best light and try to move on to better things.

I knew that chemotherapy would be life-changing for not just my mom, but for me as well. I would have to take on tasks such as making meals for her and cleaning the house more often, and I mentally prepared myself.

What i didn't prepare myself for was the added side effects of chemotherapy. The lifestyle changes of using only disposable utensils, preparing foods with gloves on, not being able to share anything with my mother, wiping down the house with Clorox wipes every day, having to deal with a more emotional mother, etc. wasnt accounted for. It was not in my plan and I've been breaking down every day as I still am expected to learn material for my classes by the AP exam deadline.

I don't know what to do. I've talked to my counselor at school and my pastors at church, my sisters are helping with the situation (both over 10 years older than me) and I still feel so hopeless. How do I handle being a student while not having a parent to do certain tasks but instead having to do it for the parent, and still manage to have a teenager lifestyle? My friends and leaders around me can only tell me so many encouragemtns before it all sounds the same and is just extremely general. My sisters tell me that it's not my job to take care of my mother and yet I still manage to take on the role. I am just in such a lost place and I need specific informational help other than just a general phrase I hear from everyone.

I don't know how else to put it but I want the best for my mom. She's the strongest woman that I know and to see her in her weakest state is difficult.

420,JuniorPaleontologist,1521803833,86jujt,4,"Apologies in advance if this is a bit TMI. 

I have what I jokingly call 'Michael Douglas cancer': HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer. We all know how I am likely to have ended up here. It's awkward, but I have chosen to be open about it, as I believe it's important to raise awareness.

The issue is, my wife feels incredibly guilty that she 'made me sick'. We've been together, monogamously, for over 8 years. She's had an HPV swab with a pap smear, and she's OK. We both know that HPV infection can linger, and in some cases the initial antibody production precedes the malignant changes by over a decade, and so it could well be from some previous partner of mine... indeed, it probably is, and from a time long before the link between HPV and these cancers was as ubiquitously understood as today, and certainly before the vaccine was a thing.

But she still feels guilt, which she does her best to hide, but it bubbles over sometimes. We'll have breakdown sessions of weeping, 'if only', 'I'm sorry', 'what if', and so on. Now part of this is no doubt a standard psychological response; we all tend to wonder whether we could have done something differently to help someone who gets sick, and even blame ourselves though we're not at fault. But this particular cancer has a cruel twist, that ""someone gave it to me"" (yeah, it's not quite that simple, but still), and so the thought process is perhaps even more natural. There's a malicious stigma with lung cancer that people 'deserve it' for smoking...even if they're non-smokers, and even though smokers don't *deserve* to suffer like that for their choices anyway. This is similar, with the kicker that the 'cause' is somebody else, maybe even a devoted life partner, and physical intimacy, the ultimate expression of that devotion, is how it happened (I'm sure for other couples the opposite might be the problem, where it raises all kinds of issues of promiscuity, sexual pasts, etc, which may be equally difficult to deal with).

I've told her that even if I did get HPV from her (and I'm sure I didn't), I love her, don't blame her, and would do it all again for the time I've had with her and our children. But it doesn't seem to be enough. I don't want her shouldering the guilt, which isn't her burden to carry. Just dealing with the illness itself is more than anyone should have to handle.

In one of the scenes, a mutated bear eats a scientist that had been sent out to investigate the aura. Since this happens inside the aura, both the bear and the scientist merge. In a scene later in the movie,  another character remarks how horrible this must have been -- to have the part of you that is suffering the most live on while the rest of you disappears. 

This really rang true for me. My father died not too long ago after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, and my most vivid memories of him are still those were he was in excruciating pain. In an unfortunate way, that's the part of him that's still the most with me. And I sometimes have a hard time imagining him when he was healthy and conscious and not horrifyingly skinny and dying.

431,exoticATLien,1521736402,86cva8,10,"Hey guys, 

Right of the bat, I am not schilling here, I am not mentioning this doctor's name, and finally, I have not even tried the treatment, let alone had success with it. I am simply asking for your thoughts on what I should do. 

So, I've been battling stage 3 esophageal cancer for 1.5 years now (32 years old). I went into remission in 2016, relapsed last summer, and am in remission again, clearing the last 3 PET scans. However, relapse rate of my cancer still hangs above my head.

Now, I'm well aware of my odds and am trying to do everything I can to prevent another relapse. Because of my aggressiveness in seeking further treatment, my oncologist has agreed to put me on Xeloda (an oral chemo) and Herceptin (I'm HER2 positive). 

During my pursuit to further my chances, one of my chemo nurses told me about a patient of her's who was given bad prognosis for stage 4 ovarian cancer, and has tried this complimentary treatment clinic, only to go into remission and stay in it for some 3 years now. I am always very, very weary of anecdotal ""I beat it with this one trick"" stories. 

Also, I am always extremely skeptical of anything not traditionally used to treat cancer. I entertain all my friends' suggestions to eat kale, kombucha, and all other goodies, but I don't for a second believe those work.

However, when I read up on this clinic, I saw that it was ran by an actual MD, who uses only FDA approved drugs, not traditionally used to treat cancers, at least not in that combination, which spiked my interest.

So, I decided to meet with the doc. We spent 3 full hours going over the treatment, statistics, etc. He was diagnosed with stage 4 Melanoma at age 32, with 6 weeks to live. He started doing 2 of these meds he's now recommending, and has been in remission for 17 years (another anecdote, I know).

Here's why I give it some merit, though:

1. He's an actual MD, with at least 17 years experience in oncology  
2. He is proposing a combination of six drugs (to be listed below), which are all FDA approved  
3. One of the drugs is Xeloda, which I'm currently taking (and recommended to me by MD Anderson)  
4. Their statistics are defined in 4 ways:  
a) Those who shows complete response to the treatment (measurable mass is gone)
b) Those who show partial response to the treatment (mass is shrinking but not gone)  
c) Those who show mass being contained (stopped spreading) 
d) Those who show no response (progress of the disease)

Currently, 80% of patients fall into top 3 categories.

Now, other things I liked about him:  
5. He made no promises, and constantly emphasized the seriousness of my situation  
6. He expressed optimism, considering that I am in remission, as most of his patients are in late stages  
7. He does not make money from the meds, as they prescribe them only. This was a big one to me  
8. He expressed genuine concern for me, and seemed to be solely focused on giving me his best opinion  
9. He encouraged me to seek out studies, opinions from my docs, and to question everything before agreeing to anything  
10. The only source of income are monthly checkups which are at more than a reasonable rate considering my other doc bills  
11. He isn't recommending me stopping current treatment, the opposite actually.

Now, again, this all may be snake oil, but some reading I did does indicate that each of these meds have been used for fighting cancer, though not very extensively.

Meds are as follows:

1. Lovastatin (cholesterol drug). Basically, he gave me 6 ways in which it may fight cancer, from disrupting building blocks for cell creation and replication, to making it harder from cells to break through vein walls (I'm sure I'm wrong on some of this, most is from memory and notes).  
2. Interferon. This is a protein that immune system produces, and it is used as a form of immunotherapy, given by injections  
3. Cimetidine. A medicine used for stomach acid, but with properties that help halt the spread of cancer cells   
4. Hydroxychloroquine a drug typically used for Malaria treatment, that also enhances immune system and disrupts cell mutation (again, I'm wrong in wording most of these)  
5. Xeloda, a chemo oral drug similar to 5FU, needs no further explanation  
6. Temozolomide, another oral chemo drug.

Again, these are rough notes I took, and he went into much greater detail.


Now, he claims that combination of these drugs may not actively kill cancer (though it does in some patients) but can significantly halt it's spread. He gave me an example of a patient of his with stage 4 pancreatic cancer who went into remission. 8 months later, a spot showed up on his pancreas but it was so little, docs did not believe it was cancer. Another 8 months, and it grew about 5mm, which they finally biopsied and confirmed it was cancer but were stunned at its slow pace. 

He told me that they're in the process of trying to start a Phase II clinical trial to get it all out there, but that the funding is a problem.

To me, he's not promising a thing. He's of belief that it may truly help contain my cancer, and possibly prevent further relapses. I have spoken to two of his patients who swear that he saved their lives.

I like the fact that their business model is reasonable and doesn't prey on you purchasing miracle drugs from them. I do appreciate the fact that they're all FDA approved drugs and that all of them have shown cancer-fighting properties. I'm strongly considering this treatment as downside isn't much. I'd be getting weekly labs, ordered by him, but not at his clinic.

What do you guys think? To me, this differs from your usual alternative/complimentary medicine, and it seems somewhat encouraging.

455,cupcakesupreme,1522807943,89lbsf,1,"Hello, I posted back here a few times in 2015 when my husband was going through colon cancer treatment.  He was declared free of disease at the end of 2015 and has been under close monitoring by his oncologist and surgeon since.  My husband is no stranger to cancer as he fought, and won, against Ewing's Sarcoma (and a reoccurrence of it) back when he was 9 and 12.   Once he was free of his cancer, I stepped away from this subreddit because I truly wanted to be free of cancer in as many ways as I could.  I know it sounds ridiculous, but it was a part of my coping with all of it.  With that in mind, I didn't know where else to go to get this off my chest.

My husband had a follow-up CT done about 10 days ago, and he got the results today; while the results aren't necessarily bad, they aren't necessarily great either.  There's a nodule in his right lung that measures 12mm and two other lymph nodes that also measure 10mm-12mm.  These were not shown on previous CT scans but he also couldn't have contrast on his previous two scans his creatinine levels were high.  His creatinine is back to somewhat normal, and he was given the contrast for this particular scan.   So far, the plan of attack is to send him for a bronchoscopy in a couple of weeks to take out the affected nodes and nodules and to biopsy any other suspicious tissues.  If anything comes back malignant, he'll end back up on chemo.

I'm not actually sure what I'm looking for in this post, except to just vent.  I know there is always a risk of cancer coming back, or a new cancer forming, but it isn't fair that this could very well be the fourth cancer battle for him.  I know I shouldn't get too ahead of myself, but we've only been married for 3.5 years and he just turned 30 a couple of weeks ago.

Very first post on Reddit, so my apologies if I have made any posting errors. My wife of 35 years was diagnosed with recurrent Stage 4 breast cancer with liver and bone mets in October of last year. This was after nearly 7 years cancer free (or so we thought). Radiation treatment for a troublesome spinal tumor and now on oral hormone treatment.

We really have no idea how well the hormone therapy is working as her oncologist kept pushing back the date for new scans (after the 3rd round, then after the 4th round, now we are on the 5th round). Last week we got a letter stating that her oncologist was retiring on May 1. In some ways this could be a blessing in disguise as it pushed us to move to a well respected cancer treatment center (MD Anderson) but it has really thrown us for a loop.

Has anyone else here had experience with changing doctors while in the midst of active treatment? I would also appreciate any information on your experiences with this particular type of cancer and its progression.

My grandma was diagnosed with uterine cancer in January, which was followed by a hysterectomy. They found out cancer spread to the nodes and so they began chemo via a port in her chest.  The second week after her first treatment (which she handled phenomenally) she fell extremely ill and had leakage from her port and umbilical.

After they finally agreed to see her, the doctors found out she has MRSA and had to remove the port. Everything since then has been extremely awful, she's been in the hospital for 3 weeks trying to beat the MRSA which is postponing her chemo. This week my grandpa confronted the oncologist about her cancer and he informed get it had metastasized to the liver. 

Unfortunately my family doesn't know that I know about the liver, as they have not even told my grandma due to her mental state from the MRSA set back (she will find out on the 10th). I am trying my best to help and research, but everything I find is telling me liver mets are terminal. I just want her to feel better, she has been my best friend all my life. We finally got her to eat more, but I don't know how we are going to tell her/help her understand a terminal diagnosis. When this all started they told her she would be in remission in 6 months.

I had the chance to get genetic testing  6 years back when I had really good health coverage.  I remember going to the counseling appointment and telling her all this info.

475,Aalynia,1522724145,898f8s,13,"I posted a little while back about how my father’s chemo was rejected by insurance and we were trying to figure out how to cover it. Got him Medicare plan B and F (I think it was F?) to cover everything. Except during that time we were getting things squared away, he started not feeling well. The nurses at his cancer center heard a slight wheeze, and one week ago today he was sent to the hospital for observation.

It has been a shit show since. He has a clot in his arm and one in his lung. He’s developed SVT and is in the ICU. The cancer appears to be in his heart. He will now be going on hospice, and his dr told me that my brother and I need to come up sooner than later (I’m here, my brother will be here tomorrow). We’re pretty sure it’s going to be soon at this point.

I don’t want to sound callous, but my coping mechanism until the end is to get shit done. So I need to know what I need to know, and I’m having a hard time sorting through everything online.

He made his healthcare proxy and they signed DNR and DNI forms. I’m having my mother call the cemetery he requested to be buried at tomorrow because he does not have a plot.

What else needs to be done? All of the financial things will shift to my mother. His will has not been updated in forever and a day, but again, everything goes to her (and she does know some things that he wants given to some people). So what steps should I be taking to lighten my mother’s load?

I know to be supportive of him, and to listen etc, but when I’m not at the hospital I need to be busy doing something useful.

EDIT: Also, anyone know anything about taking a leave after a spouse dies? My mother would likely need to come stay with me or my brother for a bit after the initial furor dies down.

Some of the frequent fliers here might recall me being treated for Stage 2 AC. This was done at a military facility here in the US.

I guess I'll start with, I fired my entire team and enlisted five new civilian doctors.

I met with my new Oncologist today who told me after reviewing my medical files, Dr. notes etc., that I did not receive the normal standard of care.

Prior to my diagnosis I was told I had a wart. Dermatology hit it with nitrogen for half a year before they said gee this isn't getting any better. They never biopsied it. They sent me to Gastroenterology who never did an exam and sent me off to the general surgeon because this medical facility doesn't have a colorectal surgeon.

He does a punch biopsy - benign, except the pathology report says it was a crap sample, not presented well and no definitive conclusion can be reached.

He calls me back in and says, we've been screwing with this for a long time so let's get it out. He does an excision - and couldn't get it all. Pathology comes back with SCC of the AM.

He then calls me back in to take another look and to see if he can get negative margins without giving me a poo bag. Nope.

The standard of care is you do a biopsy and if it's cancerous you leave it alone and do your chemo and radiation - I'm told so the radiation oncologist can see the damn thing which helps build the radiation treatment models and so they can also see if the treatment is working. Maybe the tumor (2.6cm in my case) shrinks and then they can cut the damn thing out.

Now, nobody knows if they got it although after an exam today my new oncologist didn't seem to be super optimistic they got it.

This treatment was a one shot deal. There is nothing else for me to do at this point because I'm at the max of the radiation treatment.

So now I see a surgeon on the 16th. I have to have an MRI to look at the local area and see if anything shows up and then I'm back to Oncology on the 25th.

Folks, be diligent in the process for your treatment. I wish to god I had gotten a second and third opinion before I let anyone touch me - but these doctors pressed upon me how quickly we needed to move - and they moved alright - by messing with something they shouldn't have.

I am disgusted at this point.

Long time lurker here. My father was diagnosed at the beginning of March with stage IV melanoma with brain metastases. It's been a heartbreaking month, as you can imagine. He was admitted to the hospital pretty much the moment he was diagnosed, due to brain swelling and the need for immediate radiation treatment. He's also begun the targeted therapy treatment since he is BRAF positive.

Now that he has been there for nearly a month, the hospital is looking to discharge him. He is stll incredibly weak, dealing with expressive aphasia (meaning he can't speak or communicate what he needs), can't get up to use the restroom, etc. Basically, he's bedridden with very few options to let people know what he needs. 

My family has been looking into our options--namely, nursing homes and home care. Home care seems nearly impossible at the moment with the level of care and attention he requires. In all my research, it seems that the nursing facilities in commuting distance for my mom (southern California, USA) don't have much information on how they help cancer patients. It has also been extremely challenging to find a nursing home willing to administer the targeted therapy medication my dad needs (they are taken orally, but due to his difficulty swallowing, they have been putting them through a feeding tube). 

So...any insight? Has anyone else had difficulty finding a nursing facility that is prepared to deal with the extent of care and the kind of treatment melanoma patients require? We are in the Southern California area and welcome any suggestions!

Thanks so much

From the 20th of February to just this last week I've been mostly fine and in good spirits mostly. It's one of the most curable cancers and everything, right?        


I think receiving my official diagnosis and staging on this last Monday broke me.  Suddenly I'm stage IV Hodgkins and will be doing chemo within two weeks.       

In addition some of the symptoms of my lymphoma (coughing, nausea, body pain, night sweats, insomnia) feel like they've been flaring up again.       

I'm scared of being sick (if that makes sense), I'm incredibly scared of chemo, and I'm scared of going through all this (my onco said 4-6 months of chemo) and either having to possibly do additional chemo (as my radiology oncologist said) or do radiation, or have the cancer come back anyway and then having to do all this again.         

They gave me a bunch of paperwork to look at that goes over the whole list of chemicals they'll be giving me, their side effects, and what I can do about them. They've also been setting up with the pharmacy near my house so I can get my pills for side effects right away if I need.  This is little comfort to me right now.

512,techny13,1522428636,88bsny,12,"Hi everyone, I'm a 21/m. At the start of January I went to the doctors regarding two swollen lymph nodes in my groin, one on each side. I didn't recall being sick or having a recent infection, so they ran a complete blood test which came back normal. I was told to wait for a month or two then to come back for a follow up. Fast forward to 3 months later, and the lymph nodes are still swollen. They have slightly shrunk so are are no longer visibly swollen/tender, and now feel rubbery/slightly hard and don't hurt. I've also noticed a third, smaller enlarged lymph node in my groin, but I'm not sure if this was there from the start. I went back to the doctors a few days ago and they have said that the next step would be another blood test and then a PET/CT scan followed by a biopsy. However, they've also said that because I'm showing no other symptoms (weight loss, fever, night sweats) and the lymph nodes are not growing, the chances of this being lymphoma are low and that it's likely an infection. 

With this in mind, what would be the best course of action to take? I am planning on going ahead with the blood tests, but should I push for the CT scan then potential biopsy? At the moment I am quite hesitant as the procedures are very expensive, and even though I'm on national health insurance (I live in Japan), I would still have to pay 30% out of pocket. I'm originally from the UK (free healthcare), and I'm returning home this August, so a part of me is saying I should just wait the next 4 months and see a doctor then rather than forking out hundreds now, especially considering there has been no change in symptoms. At the same time, I don't know if it's a good idea to just do nothing in the expectation that everything is ok, in case the situation does get worse.

538,vellass,1523493065,8bm2n4,4,"About 2 months ago I realized that one of my moles was very itchy (i haven't really scratched the mole, once I pin pointed the location, but the skin around it). This past weekend the itching got pretty bad and I could feel it more on the ""inside"" of my body rather than just the skin...  I also noticed some scabbing/dry looking layer of skin on top of the mole. The mole itself was about 2 to 3mm in diameter, perfectly shaped and had barely any color variation, but I think it developed a little bit of texture. 

I got it removed yesterday and it was sent for a biopsy... the second the doctor mentioned biopsy my attitude has changed dramatically. I wanted to cry right when she said it and I started to shake...now I can't stop worrying. 

Everything keeps telling me it will come back normal because it was small and perfectly shaped, but the itching and scabbing makes me think it could be something else. I break down and cry whenever I'm alone and I try to act cool around people. I wish the waiting time for the biopsy results was shorter. :( 

How have you dealt with the unknown? Is there anything that convinced you not to worry as you waited for the results?

Last summer my father (52) got diagnosed with kidney cancer, got his kidney removed, that went fine but faced major complications due to rhabdomyolysis of his opposite side butt/leg area from the removed kidney due to poor placement on the operating table and the kidney removal going far longer than expected. Caused his only remaining kidney to go into failure and it was a long saga but he came out ok. We thought we were done.

First follow up scan at the end of January showed his kidney cancer had moved to both lungs (stage IV due to metastasis automatically we were told)

A little background:
(Forgive me if I don’t have all the info but I live a a ways away from my mother and can’t be with her to go to appts so I’m only getting what she has been telling me. Not sure she’s digesting it all so were working on getting someone to go with her to appointments to keep track of what the doctors say)

My mother (56) was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (stage 2 I believe) in February. Since then she has had surgery to remove a portion of her lower right lobe. As far as I understand the cancer has only spread to the lymph nodes in the local area but no where else. She is currently recovering and waiting to be tested to see if it has spread to her brain or marrow. If it hasn’t then I believe she will be going through a 6 month chemo treatment (3 shots x 3 days every 3 weeks).

**Here’s what I want to ask:**

**If/when things get worse (since apparently small cell is very aggressive), what sort of things should we have together in terms of legal and financial paperwork?**

I would like to help her and the rest of my family get everything together before things become too chaotic or my mother is too weak to deal with these things. That way we can just focus on quality of life. 

I still have hope that we can beat this since she’s relatively young for this (according to the doctors) but I want to stay level headed about the reality of things as well. I just want to get all the big paperwork done with and settled before things potentially get worse.

Any advice or lists of things I should be helping her get together would be much appreciated. I apologize if this is in the sidebar or anywhere else I just wanted some advice from those who may have dealt with this in other ways before.

Like the title says he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on January 29th after experiencing a series of symptoms starting around new year. Early symptoms were vomiting, struggling to eat, he described a feeling of a blockage and pain to the back and abdominal area. Over the first few weeks of the year they tried enemas, laxatives and managing the vomiting. That was until they finally got round to doing scans and saw a growth on the pancreas. 

We went to the hospital on the 29th not knowing what they would say. My dad was in alot of pain that day. The meeting with the doctor still feels like yesterday. I remember my dad asking if it was terminal but the doctor just replied with how he doesn't like that word and how something can be done for everyone. Anyway my dad was admitted to the hospital for a couple of weeks so they could get him stable and eating again. 

He seemed close to normal in the hospital after a day or so and was like that until he came home. This is where I started to look after him. What I got to see at this point is how bad he would get throughout the night. The medication he was on only seemed to work until around 2 in the morning. Then the pain seemed to go upto 11. He would cry out in pain and want a hot water bottle. One at first but we had to get a second as it wasn't enough. Now a quick warning. I dont know if it was the cancer or the pain killers but my dad would put them under his back and they would burn him without us knowing. That was until one day i checked his back and it was brown and patterned. 

Over the time i looked after him the pain became worse and so did his symptoms. I would say the key changes were becoming less interested in food again, sleeping throughout most of the day, easily confused, nodding off during doing tasks and becoming weaker and weaker. That was until he took bad one night and was sick bile for the first time. The day after he was admitted into hospital again as he was very confused and in pain. He had too much calcium in the blood and a stomach blockage. 

He was in hospital for around a week as they levelled out his blood levels and sorted out the blockage. He was alright enough to discharge again on the Wednesday but that day would be the last day he would eat. 

He was home for 3 days before he started to vomit bile and he was screaming in pain. So on the Sunday morning an ambulance came and he wad admitted into hospital for the last time. This time the doctors just thought it was a gallbladder infection. Talked about getting my dad better and discharge him. Oh yeah he still had months left they told us. So the doctors got my dad stable again but he wasnt eating and pain was still a problem.

Over the next few weeks the weight just fell off my dad and he couldn't even be awake some days when I visited. Other days he would be very angry and grumpy. Then one day he fell in the shower and the next he was in the hospice. 

First couple of days he seemed okay. We chatted when he could. Then again on Wednesday he took ill and was sick more bile. It was the first time he looked like he was dying. He was stick thin and i could see his heart beat through his t shirt moving. 

The hospice thought it was a blockage in the stomach or gallbladder and tried to fix it. They also tried to put a tube down my dads nose into his stomach but since he had a broken nose a few years ago, they couldn't. That was the last day my dad was fully aware. They put him on a morphine drip and that was it until the Sunday. 

He was responsive until the weekend. Even if you could only get a few words of conversation for the entire visit. I got the dreaded phone call last Monday morning, the 2nd of April. By the time i got there he had just gone. 

I know going through cancer is not easy for anyone. I did all i could but i still regret getting frustrated at my dad when he was grumpy. I felt bad on the days where i needed to get out for a bit for my own sake and leaving him. But remember that cancer changes all that it touches, even if we are just the ones left caring or picking up the pieces. Do whatever you need to do to get through it. There is no textbook on how so dont be afraid to ask for help like i may have been. Trust your gut, doctors can be wrong about how long is left so just take each day as it comes. Lastly, if your loved ones personality does change, remember that they still love you and that the cancer is just causing them alot of pain, confusion and is a massive hit to mental health anyway. This is evident as even though my dad was grumpy or sleeping when I saw him, when others visited he told them to look after me after hes gone. Remember that it will pass.

582,FeistyNibbler,1523303523,8b1eqj,3,"Hi All,

I'm hoping you all will have some great ideas. I feel pretty useless right now. 

My older sister has had some issues with blood in her stool for about 9 months. She didn't have insurance, went to a clinic and they said it was probably stress related/hemorrhoids and told her based on her age, 34 now, 33 at the time, that it wasn't colon cancer. 

Well she went to the ER two weeks ago, because the amount of blood really scared her. They gave her a pint of blood and did a colonoscopy. They also did a CT scan and MRI* They diagnosed her over easter weekend and said it's been growing for years. She's stage 3 and luckily the spot they saw on her liver wasn't anything. They want her to do 12 weeks of chemo and surgery. 

The problems: 
She's poor. Family income of $1100 a month (disability) for two adults and two children and somehow medicaid denied her. (or so we were told by the case worker at the hospital) She's following up with them and has an appointment to speak to someone about why they were denied. She's applied before but they denied her because she hadn't filed child support? I don't even know how that makes sense since they are still married. 

Family problems:
Her husband has kidney failure, no chance of transplant (for drinking/smoking/and he's had one already) and has heart issues. Is on oxygen full time now, and dialysis 3 days a week. In the hospital at least once a month, because of breathing issues, heart issues, infections, etc. 

Two boys, but only one is problematic. Her oldest son now 12.5 yrs old is very disrespectful. He doesn't take care of himself at all even tries to avoid showering. He is constantly in trouble at school, getting in school suspensions. He has been spoiled by his father and grandfather. Grandfather has recently been letting him drive around their neighborhood. Doesn't respect authority figures and is constantly ""accidentally hurting"" his younger brother. Everyone lets him get away with this stuff because his dad is obviously dying. 
Youngest son is great. 

She's struggling to figure out what she's going to do about her family. She takes care of them so much and she's under so much stress she had Bell's Palsy for awhile a year ago. (half her face was drooping). 

I don't even know how to begin supporting her. I spent a lot of time with her while she was at the hospital and lent her my kindle. I downloaded her a bunch of movies and tv shows. 

I don't have 26K to cover her chemo, and I can't magically make her husband/father in law a better father/ grandfather. I'm feeling so useless and I have no idea where to start with helping her.

12 yrs old when I finished 4th (out of ~9000) in a 5K run, I quit running out of disappointment and ""you're nothing unless you're #1"". 

13 yrs old when I quit football because I couldn't run anymore, I put more time into video games, the pain was getting worse, ""fucking nerd, fucking liar"". 

14 yrs old when I broke down in school because I could barely walk anymore. I got laughed at because ""you're a fake, stop going on about your foot"". 

15 yrs old when a doctor finally found something wrong with me. A tumor the size of a tennis ball was located in my right foot. It was estimated to have been growing for 5 years. Synovial sarcoma, cancer. ""Why didn't you tell anyone how much pain you were in?""...

20 yrs old when I had a decent job. Finished school with good grades. I surrounded myself with people I love and I hung out in multiple large groups of tight friends. Arrogant but still easy going. Never a downer and always the life of a party. Always joking but still easy to talk to. Live quick die young attitude. Have been in pain every single moment since I was ten, nobody knew about that part of me. 

22 yrs old now. Cancer returned 4 months ago, after almost 7 years of remission, and it resulted in the amputation of my leg. I’m trying to learn how to walk. I’m on plenty of drugs to help me deal with the phantom limb pains. I was fired from my job because I can’t work.

”Why are you so cold?"", ""Why don't you open up?"", ""Why are you deflecting?"", ""Why do you never show a weak side of yourself?"", ""Why do you always try so hard at everything?"", ""Why is your guard always up?"", ""PLEASE...just let me in!"".....But this what you taught me, what you made me into? You used to shut me down when I tried to tell you. I desperately needed you, but you neglected me, you ignored me. YOU did this to me. That's what YOU forced me into. That's what you fucking wanted. Never be weak. Never cry. Never be emotional. Never complain. Never lose. Be the best at everything. Always be strong. Because that's what men do, and don't you ever forget it.

I remember being incredibly angry and extremely drunk pretty much all of the time before my most recent surgery. The amputation of my leg was a blessing in disguise, and without the return of my cancer I may have been lost forever as I couldn’t take the pain for much longer, which is kind of ironic I guess. I’ve had chronic pain for more than half of my life, and it took the removal of my leg for me to finally experience a day without pain. I’m good now, and all will be good. I work out every day and I’m almost able to run, I can walk pretty good now. Sorry for the rant but I had to get some stuff off my chest.

There have been hucksters and gullible people around for as long as we've been humans. There *are* great advances and improvements in cancer treatments, but they are incremental. They take time. And many of them are experimental. Just because one researcher found a way to stop lymphoma in the left front leg of an earthworm doesn't mean it will ever translate to human beings. These things are over-hyped all of the time. 

And I'm not dissing these researchers at all, I know that this is how cancer research works. I was saved myself by ABVD chemotherapy and that began by WWI doctors noticing that the lymph nodes of soldiers affected by mustard gas were atrophied. I'm not particularly religious but I sometimes pray for the souls of those soldiers and doctors who helped save me. 

But for goodness' sake a ""Miracle cure"" around the corner just gives people false hope. 

To me, showing someone that you actually love them (through deeds and not just words) is far better.

609,WayiiTM,1523148704,8amjtf,10,"So I had a lumpectomy at the end of February to remove a tiny stage one invasive ductal carcinoma (clean margins, clean lymph nodes).   Surgery went great, no further causes for concern, yadda yadda yadda...

Getting targetted radiation of the site for a week through this crazy SAVI implant device to hedge our odds.  I have to say that the device is uncomfortable but it's just in there until the 13th and then out it comes.

But here's the kicker for me and I'm not really on board for this last bit -- 5 years of endocrine therapy.  I CAN'T go with the most commonly prescribed course -- I have a recent history of blood clot/pulmonary embolism and am on eliquis for at least another year.  The alternative medications have side effects that frankly sound worse to me than getting another cancer and that both seriously decrease my quality of life AND are highly likely to necessitate even more time with more doctors and add more mandatory medication to my day to day.  

It doesn't help things that my oncologist, who was originally my hemotologist in the wake of a pulmonary embolism actually had a prescription for tamoxifen written out and was going to send me to start it right away.  That really has a way of shaking your confidence in a treatment plan, particularly as if I hadn't called him on it that my odds of ending up in the hospital with another PE or just dying of one before realizing what was happening would have been huge.   It kind of made digging in my heels and suggesting that I was going to do my own research after a cooling off period and draw my own conclusions easier in the wake of having concerns over the side effects of his second suggestion (joint pain, cholesterol problems, bone degeneration, worsening of any lingering cardiac problems from last fall's PE... on top of the usual apparently trivial problems of inducing menopause) trivialized.

Honestly, I'm considering shopping for a different doctor once radiation is done and finding a new team to keep an eye on the cancer front AND my pulmonary related blood work over this particular thing.

But yeah, mostly considering just not doing hormone treatments at all.  I think I've had just about enough and it just doesn't seem worth it.

I'm in the unfortunate position where my grandma has recently been diagnosed with Stage IV Colon Cancer and has been given only a few months to live. She's been the rock of my life and even just writing this is making me cry. I can't believe that I'm going to have to say goodbye to her and I'll miss her every day.

614,RoxyBenedicto,1523136188,8al7ky,17,"Hi, r/cancer.  I comment here sometimes and post occasionally.  I’m in a bit of a pickle and I need some support.  I’m sorry.  This is going to be a wall of text.  

Some background: I’m a working 34 year old wife and mother.  My son will be 4 in June.  We live in the US.  I have metastatic parotid cancer.  Known mets are in the hilar nodes in my lungs.  I recently underwent a 6 week course of external beam radiation to my chest to get control of the disease in my hilar and subcarinal nodes.  Radiation completed on 11/30/17.

A four month post radiation CT shows an enlarged left hilar node and some new nodules in my left lung (lower lobe.). The CT report said that “together these findings are suspicious for the progression of metastatic disease.”  My oncologist said that we cannot know that these findings represent new/worsening disease without biopsies, which would pose risks to me and would take time to arrange and be costly.  He offered me the opportunity to go two more months without treatment after which time we would get a new CT and see if anything grew.  Or, he told me that I could just elect to undergo chemotherapy now and not wait two more months to see what happens without treatment.  

I think that, if I did nothing for 2 more months and these areas of suspicion grew larger, I would hate myself for not acting sooner.  So I am going to start chemo next week.  

I’ve had 11 cycles of an oral chemo before and that was ok, but I’m nervous about the new regimen.  (The previous regimen was a targeted therapy.  This new one is regular old cytotoxic chemo.)  I’m afraid of the side effects, I’m afraid that I won’t be able to work during treatment.  I’m afraid that this chemo won’t stop the cancer from growing.  

So, if you’ve read this far, thanks for staying with me.  Here’s what I want to know:

• should I ask for a port?
• what do you wear to a chemo infusion?
• has anybody had an infusion reaction?  What was that like?
• when do the side effects start?
•  when are the side effects at their worst?
•  do you think it’s possible to continue to work through this chemo regimen?
•  has anybody had this particular combo before?

So needless to say I am completely overwhelmed, worried, anxious, and heart broken. I discovered a lump on my lower leg (5cm oval shaped) way back in August. I had so much going on that I forgot about it (only notice me when stretching or standing up) and carried on with my life. Since then I had a scare with my throat but it was just a benign cyst. The past couple weeks I’ve been noticing it and just have a bad/doomed feeling. Made an appointment with my doctor, she said it feels like a lipoma but need a second opinion. Saw the general surgeon and he’s just confused. He said it could be, but it could be sarcoma because it’s way low on my leg (above the ankle on the front) and it was very rare for a lipoma to form there.

For a backstory, on April 7, 2017 I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s. Went through 6 months of ABVD and my follow up PET scan in late November showed a suspicious new growth. Cue a surgical biopsy where they removed the entire lymph node. A few weeks later, they used the words “cancer free” based on the pathology.

Turns out, they got the wrong lymph node and my follow up, follow up PET scan showed that the offending lymph node quadrupled in size and has quite a few friends (more biopsies confirmed Hodgkin’s.) I got this news last week.

I met with my oncologist and I’m facing more chemo (GND?) and an auto-stem cell transplant, followed by a year of immunotherapy (every 3 weeks.)

SOOOO... that sucks but I have decided to have as much fun as possible before the bullshirt begins.

I’m having a party for which my brother is flying in and two of my best friends are driving 4 hours to attend. I’m going to be screening my favorite movie of all time: Monty Python’s Meaning of Life. I have about 20 other guests coming and, if you couldn’t tell from my movie selection, dark humor is my jam (laughter &gt; tears.)

I already knew that I had metastatic disease, but involvement in the bone is totally new.  It makes sense, I guess.  I’ve had persistent pain in that area that has been getting worse since November.  I started walking with a limp last month.

A member of my family believes himself to be very educated on matters of health.  He has no advanced degrees.  He drives a forklift for a living.  He questions the wisdom of me starting a new chemotherapy.  He’s been advising me to see a chiropractor and take various supplements and do stretches for my hip pain.  He had what I’m sure he thought was a brilliant idea the other day and texted me to tell me about it: maybe one of my legs is shorter than the other!  I should measure my legs and make sure they are the same.  (Because that would explain why, after 35 years, I would start dragging my right leg behind me when I walk - it shrunk.)

Nope, it turns out that cancer is the reason my hip hurts so much.  This is a tough day and one that certainly makes me feel like I am very tangibly losing my battle.  

But I am ever-so-slightly looking forward to telling this family member what’s up and once and for all asking him to cut this bullshit.

TTF-1 positive (strong diffuse)
CK 7 Focal patchy positive

Doc 2 said, this is a case of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with Rhabdoid morphology, and NOT to be treated as Rhabdomyosarcoma and the VAC,V,CyCE will not work on it. He also said to get the mutation markers ROS1, EFGR and ELK1 checked. He said he is confident that we should start concurrent chemotherapy and Radiation Simultaneously for 6 weeks and check the progress.

Almost exactly a year to the date that her mom was diagnosed with liver cancer, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy in February, a few days after I gave birth to my second daughter. Unfortunately the cells spread to her lymph nodes and she began chemo last week. 

To try and be there for her, while juggling a newborn, and a preschooler, has been...brutal, to say the least. Basically my husband has to take paternal leave in order for me to be able to travel the 45 min so I can physically be there for my mother and family. This means he will only receive 40% of his pay. He is the breadwinner. I have a side business, but it does not guarantee income. 

We started a GoFundMe to try and cover the financial gap, so I can help out my family while my husband cares for our eldest (she is 4). Any amount is incredibly appreciated, or even if you could just share the link, as I know not everyone is in a position to financially donate.

688,Starscrashinthesea,1523905310,8cq26w,25,"Backstory:  My husband was diagnosed with stage 2 testicular cancer  (seminoma) last April.  He did chemotherapy from May-July 2017.  I had our second child in June 2017.  We are 32.   Testicular cancer is supposed to have a good prognosis and we were focusing on that to get us through the cancer &amp; baby double whammy.  His recurred  by the end of November.  He had surgery in January to remove the residual mass with  supposed clear margins.  As of March, the cancer is once again back and now on his liver.  He just finished his second cycle of inpatient salvage chemotherapy (TIP).  In the next couple of weeks we have to decide if he is going to do two more cycles of that or switch to high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.   They say the stem cell transplant *might* be a better option right now.   They say his chances of survival have gone from 96% to maybe 30%.   That's where he is. 

Meanwhile, I have to still work full time because I was on maternity leave less than a year ago.  I have to take care of our almost four year old and our nine month old baby.   I have to take care of my husband and manage his medical appointments/treatments/talking to his team/ etc.   I have to choose between spending time with him in a hospital or giving my children some normal life time.   I feel like I am constantly split in pieces.    I don't really have any hope left and at this point I don't know how any of us would survive 60 days inpatient and 3 cycles of transplant even if that is his best option.   What I really would like is to be able talk to someone who has been a caregiver in a similar situation (young children, fairly young age of cancer patient and spouse).  I don't feel like I am able to relate as well to people who are 10-20 years older with older children and am just hoping it would help to talk to someone or hear advice from someone who has been in a similar situation to mine.   I haven't been able to find any appropriate support groups around where we live and I am even having difficulty finding an online forum to connect with others in.  

Cancer sucks.   I don't want to have to figure out how to tell my four year old that his best friend is gone and to explain to my baby why he doesn't have any memories of his dad.  I feel like the fight has left me though and I don't know how to get it back.

I do understand the risks involved and the need for extreme measures, but is there a way to make this work with my dog at home?

707,BackSack,1523838860,8cjm1m,1,"Years ago I watched my best friends father pass away from completely treatable colon cancer which went undiagnosed and untreated until it was far too late. This has weighed heavily on my mind and has been the primary reason I've gone in to get my yearly physicals and try to keep on top of my health.

I've got chronic back problems, going on 18 years. Until recently it has not responded to treatment and therapy. I'm a hypochondriac so of course assumed the worst when my phys therapist said it might be referred pain. I went in to have a prostate exam &amp; made sure to have my yearly physicals, as well as several MRI's over the years. Everything pointed to a degenerating disk. 

I was also having stomach problems &amp; figured anxiety was getting the best of me. I was obsessing over it so got on anti-depressants for anxiety.

These worked fantastically for the anxiety but the stomach pain continued. For about a year I had poop that I can best describe as terrifying.
I had the normal fecal tests which came up inconclusive. I went to a GI Dr. who confirmed my stomach was abnormally tender &amp; ordered ultrasound &amp; EGD/Colonoscopy.

The ultrasound uncovered a swollen spleen, so they sent me to Hematologist/Oncologist. They did a battery of tests &amp; everything came up inconclusive.

I just got back from my colonoscopy/EGD and they did find one polyp which came back pre-cancerous.
I'm a 35 year old male, and I'm thinking to myself that if I had waited until the 50 year mark to start, I could have very well been in my friends Dad's shoes.

I have to say, my heart goes out to those of you who have to go through these diagnosis and tests, let alone treatments. It took me a year to get to this point, and I'm certainly in a much better place now, but I'm a lucky one who has a fortunate outcome. The waiting for the test results, anxiously trying to hope for the best, it's definitely something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies.

For those of you who are facing a less fortunate outcome, your fight inspires me. It's because of people like my friend's dad that I keep a positive attitude. The amount of strength and composure my friends father showed was something I've never seen before. I can only hope too live my life in some manner similar to that.

I appreciate your stories, I feel for you. I can't say that I personally know your pain, but I empathize with you. Your strength is inspiring. I love all of you who fight against this terrible disease. I dodged the bullet this time, but I know it's just a matter of time until I get the diagnosis and will join the club myself.

That stay ended up to be two weeks, in which he developed a clot in his arm and lung and SVT. He was discharged not this past Thursday but the Thursday before to go home.

I had talks with the oncologist, his general practitioner and generally everyone and no one was willing to say he was dying. I told my brother I felt I was losing my mind because he and I were the only ones to see and discuss it. I later spoke to the oncologist privately to ask a clearer prognosis and it became clear that he knew it was soon but not how soon. My dad wanted to keep fighting to make it until August when I’m due with my daughter. The oncologist had said that was unlikely. He was right.

Once Dad got home, it was clear he went home to die. Things went rapidly downhill. He had been signed up for hospice on Tuesday, and Wednesday my mother called me saying his oxygen was dropping in the low 60s and his pulse was racing. He also told her he was going to die. I called his hospice nurse to get her over and got my husband back home to watch the kids and drove up to be there by his side. By the time I got there he was non-responsive. About 2 hrs after I got there I went to make a sandwich and he passed. I caught his last exhalation.

My mother had nothing prepared. At all. I had to call hospice back, pick a funeral home to pick him up, pick a plot in the cemetery etc etc. While I’m happy to do it and help, I’m 24 weeks pregnant, I have two young children, and I don’t live nearby (hr and 45 away). So it’s been hard bouncing back and forth as it is, and then the stress of picking the casket and everything myself because my mother wouldn’t come...I don’t know. It has been a lot the past few days. I had nightmares Wednesday and Thursday. Friday I woke up at 4 and couldn’t get back to sleep. Last night was the first night I got some real sleep.

724,ApolloChong,1523671415,8c4j5g,7,"I wanted to say thank you to everyone that posts their stories here. My mom passed away 4 1/4 years ago after battling cancer for 8 years from the time I was 10 to 18 years old. She had breast cancer which ultimately spread to her bones and liver. Throughout the eight years she went through numerous surgeries, a hip replacement, and endless chemo and radiation appointments. 

The reason I say thank you is because I really didn’t talk to my mom that much about what she was ACTUALLY feeling. She was someone who never ever complained. Cancer was such a big part of her life, that we tried not to talk about it so that we could just live normally. So, reading your stories, it helps me understand what she was really going through and how amazing she was to fight it like such a champ and always with a smile on her face and putting others before herself. I can’t imagine what she was going through, but your stories help me understand.

My mom was and still is my favorite person. We were so close and I miss her everyday. If anyone that reads this is a relative of someone with cancer: spend more time with them. I know it’s an obvious thing to say in these situations, but it’s something I regret everyday. I just wish I went to more chemo appointments with her, and just spent more time with her instead of going out with my friends. I know I was young and just a high school kid also living my own life during the worst of it, but I still wish I did more.

755,Oopiku,1523504116,8bn8ip,4,"Hope some don't mind a story. Kind of want to get it off my chest... and this felt like a place I could. 

So, a month ago I had what the Urgent Care doctor called a bad sinus infection. It had lasted a month (started in Feb), the antibiotics he gave me did nothing to help. I had started having trouble breathing (early March), and eventually I decided something else was wrong, and check into an ER.

They found the Lymphoma. Wrapped around my aortic arch, vena cava and trachea. 

Within a week I had biopsies (bone and mass), multiple CTs to rule out spread, a MUGA scan - everything to prepare for treatment. My primary care and new oncologist knew we'd have to treat as soon as possible, so we just needed the biopsy results. 

Two weeks after the ER found the mass, I was having a port installed, so I could start DA-EPOCH-R two days later. The chemo would require me to be in the hospital for 5-6 days at a time for treatment, as the vincristine, doxorubicin and etoposide are given as continuous infusions over 4 days. 

When I went into the hospital, I had swelling on my neck and shoulder from the port placement. The surgeon had placed the port deep, and the nurses at first had trouble finding it to access. But they did, and we got started. 

On the first day using the port, they ran a bag of saline. It leaked. That is, the saline leaked under my skin. They said the needle likely just came loose, and so they took the needed out and re-accessed the port. Everything worked again. They allowed a few hours for my body to absorb the saline, and started again. 

The whole time I had horrible pains in my neck, and informed the nurses of this. 

The rituximab was first, and it went okay. Had a skin reaction to it, so we an it slow. Took about 8 hours in total. The nurses then waited to start the cocktail. When they did, it started just fine. About 8 hours into it, though, my chest felt wet. I looked down, and my port's bandage was filled with leaked chemo drugs. Easy to tell because of the color. I paged the nurse, and she comes in. Her eyes go wide, and she called the doctor (it is 9 pm on Friday). She comes back, and cleans the site. She gets blood return from the port, which apparently means it is still good. She dries off the chemo that got on me, redresses, and tells me the doctor says we are good to go, as there is blood return. 

I had just had my night meds, which included a xanax, as I was very anxious about treatment. I nodded, and trusted her and the doctor. I fell asleep. 

When I woke up, the whole side of my body was hurting. I couldn't move my head, but I could see my skin on my chest out of the side of my eyes. It was so red. It was just after 7. I paged, and within minutes there were 8 nurses in my room trying to remember and figure out was to do about extravasation. I was so scared. My doctor couldn't be reached. He was off for the weekend, apparently. An on call oncologist came in an hour later. Until that point, all they did was stop the chemo, give me benadryl and put ice packs on my shoulder and neck. 

The on call oncologist was confused as to why they hadn't started extravasation procedures, and pushed them to start. They deaccessed the port, got hot pads, gave me a few shots. At this point, though, the on call oncologist gave me the bad news of what would likely happen to my skin. They then neede to find what caused the extravasation. None of the nurses had ever seen it with a port before.  The doctor said he had only heard of it rarely. 

Turns out, the swelling in my neck was a blood clot in my jugular. The swelling in my neck that I had complained about multiple times every day. That they had taken pictures of to document. The only explanation the doctor could even think of was that the clot had messed with the catheter. 

I was leaking chemo fluids from a few holes in my chest for two days. Seriously. The needle holes wouldn't close, and yellowish-orange fluid leaked from the spots for days. I was put on blood thinners, of course, and we then had to wait. And wait. And wait. 

Four days after, the skin wasn't blistering, so we tested the port. It worked. No leaking fluids. 

I didn't want to use it, but was told we had no other options for treatment. The other side of my chest is blocked by the mass, and mid lines aren't options with my chemo. 

So... we used the port. 

No leaking for the rest of the treatment. Took 13 days instead of 6. I suppose I am lucky - the skin hasn't blistered badly. It hurts, still (just finished the first round on Sunday). The skin is tight, and I have a lot of discoloration and small blisters... but, it hasn't gone neurotic, like I was told it would. 

My neck still hurts. I really hate the placement of this catheter - it is going in the side of the neck. I can feel it bend and move when I move my neck. Hate that. I guess it doesn't help that part of me feels the port and catheter tried to kill me. 

Symptoms haven't hit too hard yet, I suppose. Nausea and the fatigue are the worst, right now. Mouth sores just starting. Shoulder and neck still hurt pretty much constantly. Feels like a light sunburn, that won't go away. 

My next treatment cycle starts in less than two weeks, and honestly I am scarred to do it again. I know I need to. I know it is important, as this is an aggressive form. I know that statistics are on my side, if it is treated right. 

But I just can't help but not want to go through all that again.

Finally, in January I got a new gyno who did a biopsy. I got ""the call"" and went in. Endometrial cancer. Then the whirlwind began. I was scheduled for surgery within three weeks. The abdomen pain was a large cancerous mass growing on the outside of my ovary and up into my bowels. I was terrified. I had the large incision total hysterectomy. It was official, it's Stage IV. 


So, yeah, tomorrow I start chemo and I'm terrified again. Not so much about the chemo, but about getting an infection after. I'm scared of being sick for the next eighteen weeks. I'm just scared and tired. I keep saying I can do this, but I'm not sure I can. And these damn steroids are making me antsy.

779,Chi847,1524622810,8eq44v,11,"Diagnosed with AML this past Sept.  Numerous genetic flaws made a bone marrow transplant necessary.  I basically sailed through induction/consolidation and other then some nausea with the bone marrow prep chemo there were no issues.  I've since had a biopsy which shows I am clean of cancer currently.  I had been told just to make it to my 100 days and things start to return to normal.  Instead everything is falling apart.

I used to have to visit the hospital infusion center twice a week for infusions of magnesium and saline as one of the meds tacrolimus I'm told ""eats"" magnesium and the transplant team oncologist would deign to visit me around 4-5 hours after my arrival and the infusion would take around 2 hours, so I would end up sitting in a dark room for several hours waiting for him.

Almost overnight I had extremely red skin, rash and itching which I found out are symptoms of GVHD.  It was brought to the attention of the doctor and his NP who followed him.  After a several second exam, they proclaimed no issue or redness could be observed despite the fact that the infusion center nurse noted it in her charting the minute I walked in.  I should mention the transplant team takes no notes and charts nothing.

I found out later that the doctor was running a multi hospital drug study and that no one qualified yet so he let my case of GVHD progress just so I would qualify for the study.  He compromised my health just so he could make more money.

And now I have chronic GVHD which I was trying to avoid

His office calls us liars, we've shown up for appointment times that we have confirmed  via card and receptionist and they refuse to let us in, I'm not allowed to drive anymore so my parents come with.

They've punted me between the Infusion Center and their office a good half dozen times and during one of my last stints while doing an infusion that just finished all the staff just left the office and shut off the lights without a word.

The only person there was a tech who can't by law do anything, she was just running around freaked out.  It took 15 minutes to get help from staff on another floor.  I was just waiting to be disconnected but there was numerous other patients there that they just abandoned.

I had been told over and over once I hit 100 days I would be discharged and sent back to my normal oncologist who I have a good relationship with.  They proved to be a lie.  They also said they would remove my central line once 100 days hit.  Now they say they have no intention of doing so without any explanation. I could easily have it in for another year+

I've been on prednisone since Jan and I was supposed to be off it by now but since they let my GVHD turn chronic by ignoring it, they say they can't take me off it ever along with tacro.  Both are immunosupressants.  They also say I can't be vaccinated until I'm off Immunosuppresants, but then they tell me I can't get off them either, so I can't get vaccinated.  I had hoped to travel, can't do it, hoped to return to the gym, can't do it.

Also thanks to prednisone I have permanent diabetes, So I went from dealing with the neutropenic diet straight to no flour/sugar/salt/dairy/fruit.

In the midst of this I caught a cause of fungal pneumonia which landed me as inpatient for about 3 weeks.  I'm told it has around a 90% fatality rate, right now I'm wondering if I wouldn't have been better off if it killed me

Due to this, I'm now on blood thinners and with the numerous finger pokes I must do a day, I no longer clot and I just bleed, tissue after tissue.  Not to mention some med of mine gives me severe tremors in my hands so I have very limited use of my hands, I can't even hold a fork anymore and if I eat or drink anything with the slightest bit of heat or chill to it my teeth erupt in agonizing pain, which was never a problem before prednisone.

795,hudibat,1524533271,8egpx2,8,"About two and a half years ago, my dad was diagnosed with colon cancer. Said it was Stage I. I didn't ask many questions, because I didnt really know what to do. He had part of his large intestine removed and all seemed well. 

Later that year, mom was diagnosed with Kidney cancer (Stage I) and lung cancer (Stage I). I was slightly more involved with that, even though my dad being sick was much more emotional and difficult for me. 

My dad called me last week and said that they had done some blood work, his ""markers"" were high, so they did a CT scan. He said they told him he had Stage IV liver cancer. In the last 4 days, I have done a ton of reading. I also jumped in the car with my kids and drove 7 hours to surprise my dad. After reading his CT report, he has a tumor near his rectum, several spots on both lobes of the liver, and a nodule on the lung that the doctors seem to have missed. His biopsy is Friday. Probably a follow up with oncologist next week but he also still needs a colonoscopy. It seems that it is colon cancer that has metastasized to the liver. 

I think that this situation may be far worse than he realizes or maybe he just is not admitting it. And that's ok for now. The thought of my dad being in any kind of pain just breaks me. He simply doesn't deserve this. And I just want to make it all better for him. 

He isn't even my dad. Somehow my mom met him after her divorce from our dad, and he loved her and her two bratty children. After our ""real"" dad committed suicide, he stuck around. Both my brother and I were terrible kids. He stuck around. My brother died of a drug overdose almost 20 years ago.... he has stuck around. He has been the best grandpa to my kids. He's been my dad.

810,vidbeau,1524454551,8e8kr0,4,"So a rough outline of my situation:

My Nonna, my world in a person, the only person whose unconditional love I have ever felt, passed last February from liver cancer. I spent my days and most of my nights with her at her home and then got her into palliative care when I could no longer physically maneuver her, myself. I held her hand and watched her die before me. 

This past December, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer (a year after her mother was diagnosed with liver cancer). She had a lumpectomy in February, 4 days before I had my second daughter. Cancer cells spread to her lymph nodes and she began chemo earlier this month. 

Basicslly- my mom and I have always had a very....tense? Relationship. I have always been jealous of her social life and her consistently choosing her friends and hobbies over everything else, including me and my girls. It has been something I have working through for years. After my Nonna died, we moved 45 minutes away from my mom, into a new city. With my mom undergoing treatment, and the continued grief from loosing my Nonna, having a newborn with a preschooler, in a different city....I have been struggling. A lot. My husband will be taking paternal leave for the months of June and July so that I can be with my mom and he can watch my eldest who is 4. We are in no way financially able to do this, but we have been selling many of our belongings and have gotten creative to try and raise money to mend the gap. 

Well, my mom has undergone 2 treatments thus far. Thankfully, she has not had too many adverse side effects, other than a foggy head and moments of exhaustion. After her first treatment, she went on a week long trip with my father, which I thought was great. Well, after this past treatment, she went to her book club and theatre, but was too exhausted from those things, to come and see me and my daughters (I had gone up to see her prior to her second treatment, with my 2 month old, to get our hair cut so I could support her). 

The day after I went with her to get our hair cut, my eldest broke down and cried. She missed my mom and dad. She has been through a hell of a lot in the past few years of her very short life, dealing with all of this stuff. I helped her call my dad and she told him how much he missed them and wanted to see them. Dad told her that my mom was resting and as soon as she felt better, they would visit. As I spoke with him to get an update on my mom, my daughter went up to her room and sobbed. When I went to see her, she asked me why my mom was sick and needed to rest....my heart shattered for her. I told my mom the following day how much my daughter missed her...

And I wrote a novel....well, basically...I'm hurt. I'm hurt that again, mom chose her friends and clubs and hobbies, over me and my family, when we are so desperate to spend time with her. Feeling hurt, however, has me feeling guilty...I'm glad she is up and about and not allowing this to get her down, thus far...but I am also realistic and know that she can't keep this momentum up for the entire duration of her treatment....I am sad that she is choosing to spend the time she is not at doctors appointments and resting, away from me and my girls.....I feel selfish and awful for feeling sad about this. Loosing my Nonna broke me, I just want my mom.....I want to spend time with my mom....(and yes, she knows how desperate I am to spend time with her, because I've told her, and she always has a great time when we do see eachother, so I just don't know)

I never had much in the way of muscle, but strength-wise, I could always do or carry what I needed to with the little slivers of muscle which endured.

830,Woodyard801,1524393247,8e2h9i,21,"Ever since my two years of cancer treatments, my views on life, love, happiness, really all aspects of life have changed very drastically. 

The more time goes by, the harder it becomes to find people I enjoy being around. Even many old friends I’ve had since school have become less tolerable, and I find myself slowly steeping back from their company.

It just seems like I don’t meet many people who get me or the big picture (or at least my idea of it) or what’s important. People complain about such trivial things and I can’t help but say, “You’re focusing on all the wrong things here. *This* is what really matters.”

I mean not to be rude or press my beliefs on others, I just can’t handle when people can’t see optimism in life, or the beauty in what they have, or how important the gift of life is.

The only people that seem to get my ideology at all is people who have had to face their mortality; people who have experienced the worst life has to offer. Because these are the people that, usually, can see that by experiencing the worst, we gain a clear perspective on THE BEST life has to offer. 

For me, just being here is one of the best things of all. I may not have a lot of money in my pocket (or anywhere), but at least I’m not breaking my back 60 hours a week to make money I’ll never have time to spend, while other people are banking millions off me.

I have happiness. I have family. Friends. Occasionally, even women that find me desirable (Not that I’m even remotely interested in 99% of the). I have a dog, and we have a roof and four walls, and a bed to sleep in. I have soccer balls, and trees I can kick it between. 

But most importantly, I have my health. 

And as long as I have these things, you will not hear me complaining. As long as I have even a few of these things, I will always have happiness.

I'm a 34 year old part-time smoker (smoked as a teen into my early 20's, gave up for 8 years approx, then took it up again part-time after a divorce).

Recently I've been getting extreme pain behind my right shoulderblade, and radiating weakness/pain/heaviness down my right arm into my hand. At times my fingers/thumb will feel swollen, numb and like my grip strength is diminished.

My doctor has had me get the following imaging in the past two months:

- A spinal x-ray
- A CT scan of my head/ears (as I was experiencing an unrelated issue with a dysfunctional eustachian tube)
- A cervical spine MRI
- I have also had an EMG performed by a neurologist

The cervical spine MRI showed that I had bulging discs in my neck, one of which was possibly compressing the C6 nerve root.  I was sent to get a CT-guided cortisone injection into the nerve root (another CT scan of my neck, I guess).

The nerve root injection has done nothing to ease my symptoms, and in fact they seem to have worsened in the 10 days after the nerve root injection.

This is not a 'could this be cancer?' post as I know that it's impossible to say over the internet, but I have recently stumbled across Pancoast Tumours and was quite rattled when I saw that every symptom that I have (including the ptosis of my left eye that I've had for quite some time now that I always chalked out to being too tired or having drunk too much) was reflected in the symptoms for these types of tumours.

My question is that with the imaging I have had performed already, is it likely that the parts of the lungs where a Pancoast tumour would normally manifest would show in these?  At present I am an anxious mess, and also in unending pain and have been averaging 3 hours of sleep per night due to the pain over the last few weeks so I guess that isn't helping.  I'm not able to see my doctor for another 48 hours and I suppose I'm just trying to find ways to put my mind at ease between now and then (and even after I see him, the best-case outcome is that I will be sent for another scan which is more time I need to sit around in pain and full of anxiety).

I suppose I'm just hoping that it's likely that a Pancoast tumour might be seen in a cervical MRI or one of the other imaging studies I've had done, which might set my mind at ease I guess.  I do know that, smoking history or not, getting any sort of lung cancer at my age would be rare anyway, but it's just hard to ignore my strange symptoms combined with the symptoms of a Pancoast tumour and not have a degree of concern when reading them.

He's one of my closest uncle, the uncle that i look forward to every family reunion. The uncle that i go to whenever i have problems, the uncle that was more a dad to me than than the one i have. But our relationship isn't that ""fun"" uncle-nephew that jokes together and if we're together most of the time it's just silently watching tv. 

I've visited him everyday since i got the news, with just us sitting awkwardly watching tv making small talks. He acts normal, looks normal, albeit a little tired and the bandages/patches due to all the tests. 
I know he don't has much time left, and he's going to get worse as the medication take effects. 

Is it wrong that I want to hug him and tell him how much of an impact he had been in my life, how much he meant to me, how much i don't want him to go? Will me telling him all this just upset him. 

I'm not taking all this too well, i burst into tears randomly whenever i think of him.

I feel so helpless. I feel intruding whenever i drop by, as deep down i know the visits is more about me wanting to spend as much time as i can with him when i still can.

864,svartsven,1524182841,8djek8,6,"I've had a bump inside my lower lip for probably a year. First visit to the dentist, he said I'm probably fine, and it's likely a mucocele cyst. Next appointment he gets suspicious and sends me to a maxofacial surgeon to have it removed and biopsied. Had it removed a couple of weeks ago. Surgeon thought it was a sebaceous cyst but sent it for testing after the procedure, and we schedule a routine post op.

Flash forward to yesterday. Brought my stepson to the dentist, who's also my dentist. He says, ""Hey, I got this pathologist's report. Sounds kind of nasty.""   I look at the report, and see malignant mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Fortunately I have my post op the next day. I still spend the intervening hours googling furiously, and reading journal articles. The pathologist's report is fairly encouraging, noting that it appears to be low grade and ""fully excised."" However, there's also a note that there's ""nesting close to the margins"" and ""according to another set of criteria, it is grade II."" Sill, based on the literature I can find, it sounds like I should be optimistic. 

Now we get to this morning and the post op. Having prepared myself for a ""dodged bullet"" conversation with my oral surgeon,  I was fairly comfortable going into the appointment, and hoping to get news that would comfort my terrified wife. This was not the case. The surgeon let me know it was cancer, and insisted that I get to an ENT asap. Got an appointment set for a month later. Surgeon let's me know it needs to be next week.

So, here I am. I had cancer. Might still have cancer. Was feeling ok. Now I'm just not sure what to think.","I think I'm OK, but I don't know",https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8djek8/i_think_im_ok_but_i_dont_know/,1524204441.0,2018-04-19 19:07:21
865,shailt,1524173513,8diciq,40,"I met with my oncologist today. Things are not looking good. I was pulled off an oral chemo two months ago due to blood clots. Now the oncologist is hesitant to put me on another chemo because my blood counts are low and my body weight continues to be low. I have tried over several months to put on weight but it is just not working. High protein and calorie drinks, icecreams, pbj sandwiches, mashed potatoes - name it, I have tried them.

Add to that, my daily terrible stomach pains, nausea, bloating and all other issues makes it extremely difficult for me to eat or drink like a normal person. I guess its just the nature of the disease or cachexia.

So after having gone through the standard cancer treatments - chemo, radiation, surgery, chemo...my options are at a dead end. The oncologist said that without treatment I could last perhaps a few weeks, months to a year - he cannot really say. And even if I were to get chemo, it won't help me much, maybe add a little more time to the inevitable.

So, I guess thats it. I lost my wife to another non-related cancer a few years ago. She was 38. And now I am facing death before reaching 50. My son who is majoring in Biology because he wants to be a doctor (A determined decision made by him after his mom's death) will unfortunately become an orphan.

I shall continue to help others as much as possible in this wonderful supportive sub, as I have been doing. If you don't read from me for quite a while, assume that I have sailed beyond the horizon.

While there is nothing that suggests the immunotherapy (Opdivo/Yervoy) will affect her ovaries, at 35 the treatment can go on for years and this gives us some insurance for the future in terms of family planning. Our Onc does not want her pregnant while on immunotherapy. I understand this has to do with pregnancy needing an immune-suppressive environment, which is not possible with the treatment she will be going on. 

However, despite our Onc assuring us that delaying treatment a month would be OK, its a great stressor for us both. I've asked why we can't do egg collection while she is on immunotherapy and the answer seems to be that there is just no data yet on IVF success rates post immunotherapy. Also, collecting the eggs prior to therapy start is just one less thing we have to worry about. 

We've spoken with two fertility clinics, neither of which have any experience with immunotherapy and IVF. Does anyone have any experience dealing with this on their own, as it relates to immunotherapy?

868,zenmap12,1524154295,8dftwu,4,"Hi guys, my mom was diagnosed with Colon Cancer stage IV back in August 2017.
It went under chemo until December (she was having issues with the full doses so they put larger periods). We had a pretty good Christmas with all the family together, like every Christmas in our grandparent's house.  I was able to WFH since early Dec to early January. Then she got an obstruction due to the tumor. I had to go back to my state in January 19th. Best doctor available will try resection of not only main tumor but also attempt removing hepatic metastasis. I was able to have a reasonable good day with mom that Friday. 

We eat together along with my sister, we sleep all together in our aunt's house bed and then I take her to the Med Oncologist (in charge of her chemos) the doctor showed concern and my mom drop some dark jokes about not seeing him again. She was sick yes, but she was almost the same women she was a year ago.

Then Sat they try the procedure. Her platelets were too low, they give her a day more to recover. 
She underwent surgery on Sunday. I was afraid and somehow ready to saw her go during surgery. But the surgery went ok, they removed the main tumor and metastasis. I recover hope. At least I thought I was going to be able to spend more time with her.
I pass that night in the hospital with her and my sister, I even try to continue working while in the hospital. My sister took care of her while I went running errands and get some more donors for blood and platelets (which were always low).

But she didn't recover, 3 days after she was too tired, Doctors started to show concern. My whole family, even my grandpa came to support her. Next day at night, she was put on oxygen, and the doctor decided to move her to another and better hospital with an Intensive Care Unit (the best in the state). Doctors always tried to say that she was delicate but they always showed hope to us. They say it was probably nothing. But they want to do another surgery to remove a strange body in her abdomen (which could it be an inflammatory liquid only). 

The move was traumatic, an ambulance and then a short wait for the paperwork. Top of that was a public hospital.
I walked along her as she was about to enter surgery, and shortly before she enter to the operating room I smile at her and showed a thumb up. She reply back.

Surgery last 1 hour. Then doctors came to tell us that they remove an infected coagulated blood. And that she was going to enter ICU in a couple of hours. But that aside of that previous surgery scars seemed ok and that. They told us that we should wait to any signs of recovery in the next 24 hours.

At 5 PM ICU let me know that she was admitted. And I had to do some paperwork. NO ONE EVER TOLD ME HOW BAD EVERYTHING WAS. 

Doctor on ICU just asked me for some medicines and clinic history of my mom, I wasn't able to visit her. 

They told me that I will know if something went bad if they call me. I spent the night (2 nights at that momment) without sleep. Then my cousing came to me to tell me that they just called me. It was 00:00 of Jan 26th

The doctor asked the social worker to stay with me. Then he gave me her clinic status. On of the things that shocked me is that she had 20 centigrades of temperature during 2 straight hours, before they being able to increase it to 32... then it hit me, my mom wasn;t there anymore... her essence has passed away, at we have at that moment was her body... and in really bad state, everything was failling rapidly.

""She isn't going to pass the night""

Social worker was an asshole, I asked a couple of questions which repied with quick generic stupid questions. I was in shock... I called my family which was sleeping at my aunts. 
2 hours later they told me my mom has passed...

When she was alive my dad died (they were divorced) and she told me that if I want to I could, but she recommend me to not look at the coffin to remember my dad as he was when waas alive. So I decided not to look at her either at ICU. BUT I HAVE TO RECOGNIZE HER TO RECEIVE HER BODY. AND THEN AT THE FUNERARY SERVICES...

My mom died and every responsibility quickly fell over me, my sister at college, and take care of everyone else but me, I felt like I didn't ever have time to grief...
I also I'm afraid that she spent her last hours in this planet in pain and suffer, and mostly of all, alone, Idk if following her advice was ok, I'm trying to convince myself that she wasn't there and the doctor told me several times that she was sedated and never woke up really after surgery...

anyway, Cancer took away my mom and my life as it was before, in just 6 months... this thing sucks...

Then lung surgery for a mass three months ago, with 9 days in the ICU. Now I'm heading back next week for another surgery, this time for what is the ""primary"" tumor, involving abdominal surgery. 

My hospital experience post-surgery last time was traumatic. I woke up intubated and tied down, and was kept that way for a full 24 hours. It was horrifying. The epidural failed. The pain pump failed and then became infected. My white blood cell count went through the roof and the pain was excruciating.

This next surgery is more doubtful - it could be quick with a half-dozen laparoscopic punctures, or I could wake up with a full-length abdominal incision and a long recovery time. I am trying not to be fearful &amp; stressed about it, but I am. I have deficits from the last surgery now - pain, numbness, reduced lung capacity. What will the next one bring? How long can I keep managing on my own?

I've always been the caretaker, the problem solver, in my group of family &amp; friends. I run an organization, I'm responsible for one of my parents. Until this past five months, I've not been in the position of being the one needing support or help. A couple friends have done what they can, but my family members have either freaked out (meaning I have to be considerate of their feelings) or I've gotten a polite ""good luck with that"" (from my own father, who has moaned about his many illnesses pretty much every visit/phone call for the past 20 years).

I must shamefully admit my own hypocrisy with such presumptuous inquiry when the shoe has been on the other side. Cancer, mentioned in its most generic form in an attempt to sometimes exercise a modicum of privacy over very nuanced diagnostic results I've yet to fully grasp, doesn't seem adequate enough of a descriptor to satisfy the curiosities of my beloved people, many of whom just want the gritty details in which to amateurishly size up my survival odds through a spectrum of pity gazes and *oy veys* that I've come to read with expertise from the supportive *this is tough, but you'll be okay.* to the rather dire *my mother died in terrible pain from cancer. Don't be afraid to stockpile opiates as you'll need them for an exit strategy.*

I know we aren't so far away from a dystopian age, when the rosters of our health conditions are registered publicly for like votes that qualify us to either move on for further treatment options or to plead our case to the audience for a chance to stay in or leave the big competition of life, but until then I wish the previous social contract of yesteryear were still in effect to allow for social expectation disclosure options to match a patient's comfort level. So in the meantime, when pressed for further details, I've occasionally resorted to the frank announcement of early stage ovarian cancer because it is a welcome distraction from the anxiety of treatment for my Non-Hodgkins lymphoma to see those folks try to work out the astronomically impossible math of that happening to a middle-aged guy.

874,r1ker,1524128720,8dda6s,5,"first off, hi, i’m cam, and this post is tentative in light of my mother’s recent hospitalization for double pneumonia and subsequent developments. 

mom’s 55 (she just turned 28 on st. patrick’s day ;) ) and a lifelong smoker. i think one time i prodded my granny for an answer to the question of how long she’d been smoking and granny told me since she was nine. easily a pack and a half a day, sometimes two if she’s under stress. considering her recent divorce and how her, blessedly, ex-husband is handling things, we’ve advanced into two pack territory. 

smoked while pregnant, smokes in the rain, smokes while in rush hour, and if she had it her way, she’d smoke on a plane. 

we both live in mississippi and the rising cost of cigarettes and her income made me think she was liable to quit. if anything, the cost changes increased it and allowed her to strategize her habit. 

anyway, she’s had pneumonia earlier this year (january) and saturday she called to let me and my sister know she’d been admitted again for double pneumonia. my sister is a nurse and wasn’t surprised. 

i work at a cancer registry and handle patient data everyday. this was eerily similar to lung cancer stories i’ve read over the last few months. my stomach fell. 

after an ungodly cocktail of medication and antibiotics, mom seemed to be on the mend. her white blood cell count was ranging from 12,000-20,000, but was coming down as of yesterday morning. 

i should have lived in ignorance about the nodules she failed to tell me about that were discovered in her lungs and esophagus on the CT she had. she told my sister and not me and when i bothered her enough to find out more - i knew this was no ordinary pneumonia case - she told me. 

i can’t go into tremendous detail about my job for the sake of legality but i’ve handled hundreds of thousands of documents about lung cancer, as well as my fair share of tissue and cytology data about it. i know what this can do. and i don’t know how to handle it.

I'm going through this by myself as I'm the only child, and I know my parents (esp. my mom) will faint if they find out.

I'm getting a pelvic MRI done this weekend to get more details, but my doctor suggested either hysterectomy or IUD/progesterone treatment. I'm currently single, but I'm wanting to have a child later so I'm going with the latter option. I can't believe this is happening to me... I'm also worried because I also don't think I'm going to marry anytime soon because I don't have that special someone yet either. Everything seems so risky. I always thought my period was irregular because my mom also had irregular periods, but I was wrong. I regret getting educated about the importance of regularly seeing a gynecologist. No one really taught me about it. I just finished my PhD last year and started a job this year as well. Worked hard all my life and I get a cancer... 

I'm also seeing a male doctor, he's older and experienced. But I'm not sure... He did great with my first surgery, but I find myself uncomfortable talking to him as I don't think he would understand what I am going through (I might be just biased here). Would a female doctor be more emphathetic of my situation and give me more thoughtful advice?

after around 2-3 months of stomach and bowel issues (and a lump found in my neck and armpit), they found a mass in my abdomen with ultrasound. 

i heard the doctor mutter “fuck” under his breath while he read the results. he told me it’s probably no big deal and told me i will need an MRI. well, they scheduled an MRI but they are telling me i have to wait 4+ months to have one because it is not an “urgent” matter.

Unfortunately, they've done such a work up prior to this ultrasound I just had, that they firmly believe it is not an infection or autoimmune. I kind of wish it was though.

But I don't know what'll happen yet! I'm trying to stay positive and tell myself it'll be something easy. I can tell my mom is worried but she's trying to hide it because she knows I'm scared too. Frustrated and scared. 

I'm beyond worried that if these malignant nodes they saw in the imaging are aggressive, because I swear they were not there a month ago.

Sorry if venting posts are sad. I don't have anyone to talk to and my anxiety is through the roof. Being told that at this point, the way they look and have stayed/grown in about 5 months is very suspicious of lymphoma. What am I even suppose to think?

I start my cosmetology course next Tuesday... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't terrified. I don't want to miss class. I worked so hard to save money to go to higher education.. and my mom can't afford it by herself while she's taking care of my little brother.

Waiting to even get the biopsy scheduled is awful.. but I'm doing my best to be patient.

Thank you for letting me vent, whoever you are. I appreciate it tons. I hope you have a good day today and you're able to smile big.

890,Ruderich,1525285121,8gjlr6,15,"Hi,
i dont know if you are interested in this story, but i have the feeling to tell it. Sorry for my bad english, i hope you will understand it.
Im am now 29 years old (male), my mom was 51. I have two smaller brothers (21 and 25). 

Now i will tell you how all this happened.
At first, 8 weeks ago everything startet with a flue and strong backpain. My mother went to the doctor and got antibiotics. It helped and the flue was better 7 days later but the backpain was getting stronger. She went to the doctor again and they made some examinations. The did some roentgen examinations and ultrasonic. The result was, that they found some mass in the left lung. So they send her to a bronchoscopy. Before we got the results (5 days after the bronchoscopy), the backpain was so strong that we had to call an ambulance and get her to hospital. There they made again some roentgen and found a tumor in the back of her neck which destroied three neck vertebrates. The doctors had to do a emergency surgery because the tumor was pressing on her nerves. So they removed the three neck vertebrates and replaced them with steelplates.
It was successfull and my mom had to stay at the intensive care unit for one day. When she got better, she was transfered to a normal station in hospital.
Two days later she had respiratory complaints and needed to get back to the intensive station because her right lung was infected. 
They did some tests and examinations because at first they thought it could be an other tumor. 
By these examinations they found more tumores. Two in the brain, one in the liver, one in the spleen. 
Two weeks before the had no disease symptoms. It was a shock for my family. 
At the first evening on the intensive station the doctors said it was critical and the are not sure if my mother would make it to the next day. So my two brothers, my father (who lives with his new girlfriend) and me came to the hospital and there was a doctor who told us, we should say goodbye to our mother, in case she would not make it till the next day. We hat 15 min each to be alone with her and tell her all the things we would like to tell her and say goodbye. It was a horrible feeling. Later that evening a priest came and made a sermon for her. In this sermon he told us to praise the lord for his grace and mercy...I aksed myselfe where the mercy is when my mother (who was the righteoust and fairest person i ever met) dies from cancer with 51. She just finished renovating her house where she was living for the last three years, finished her education to be a teacher 5 years ago and finally started living her own life. 
Fortunately she made it till the next day. The next 6 days my brothers, my father, my mothers best friend and me did shifts of 6-8 hours a day at the hospital to stay with my mother. She had respiratory support with a mask, but was still conscious. She told us, that she would never want to get life-sustaining measures, because my grandparents hat those and it was horrible for her to see them like that.
She was high on morphine because she was in bad pain and had some panic attacks because of difficulties in breathing. 
But more or less, she was able to talk to us.
I had deep conversations with her about her life and my life and our life together. About the good an the bad things that happened and about the good things that are going to happen when she would get home. We made some plans to go to holiday together and talked about the time when she would be the grandmother of my future children. I told her how much i love her and how important she is for me. I need to say that i was a preemie and had since the beginning of my life a very strong binding to her. Some would call me a namby-pamby.

Everyday when i was leaving her, i asked her what she will do until i come back the next day and she answered ""breathing"". It was a kind of a ritual. 
At the 5th and 6th day on the intensive station she was very high on morphine, because the pain was getting stronger. She couldnt talk much, because she was very sedated. At the evening of the 6th day, when i asked her what she will do untill the next day, she didnt answered and i thought she was at sleep and didnt hear me. Her best friend stayed with her at the hospital that night. some hours later her friend called me and told me, we should come to hospital FAST. I had a very bad feeling and rushed to the hospital with my brothers. When we arrived my father was already there. When we came into her room, my fathers girlfriend and the best friend of my mother were sitting on an empty bed and my father was sitting ot the ground in front of my mothers bed crying. When i saw my mother, without her breathing mask, lying on the bed, i knew she died, but i didnt fee one thing. I was so shocked that i even couldnt move and was able to only say ""oh no"". And that was  what was going threw my mind in circles...some minuits later, i ralised what happened and started to cry. I dont know how long i was sitting there on the ground crying with my brothers and my father, but i think it was about 1-2 hours. It was like the ground was shattered and i was falling and falling and nothing matters anymore. 

This happend 4 weeks ago now and i am very sad. The first week after her death i dreamed of the last evening every night. Its getting better now, but now i really miss her every day. I have a big pain in my heart and dark cloud on my mind. But i am very happy, that i had this one last week with her. It was a really great time an it was very intense. I am thankful, that i was able to say goodbye and had the chance to talk things out.

So my advice to all of you is: Take some time to spend it with your beloved ones. Tell them what they mean to you and dont be shy. Tell them that you love them and tell them how important they are. Dont wait until something tragic happens. Tell them every day that you are proud of them and thankfull for what they give to you.

897,Reviledseraphim,1525226153,8gdu9n,21,"I got diagnosed with a treatable chronic cancer about a year and a half ago, and I live in the U.S. 
I was 25 years old. I had just moved to Kansas City, away from my hometown, which I hated, and I had started to put down roots. No college degree, but I had a really well paying job. 

Then I got sick, and I had to move back home with my mom while on treatment, less than 30 miles from my hometown. I've always been slightly anxious, but now everything is ramped up to 10. Sudden bursts of anxiety &amp; rage come out of nowhere through out my day. 

My employer stresses me out, by virtue of being a corporation that has become infamous for layoffs in the last 10 years or so. I'm moving back out on my own again in 24 days. No mom, no safety net.

 U.S. healthcare is employment dependent, and my medication is more than $10,000 a month, every month, possibly for the rest of my life, as there is no ""cure"". I'm looking at going back to college so I can finish my degree and make myself more ""employable"", should my company ever let me go, but I don't know if I can realistically handle school and a full time job.

 A girl I'm very good friends with and whom I have had romantic entanglements before, though we never officially ""dated"", is seeing someone. I didn't find out until I asked her if she wanted to go on a date next time she came in town, since I would FINALLY have my own place again. I flew in to see her last October, spend some time with her, but I could tell she wasn't ready to date anyone yet, having just gotten out of an abusive relationship, so I backed off and just stayed in touch. When I found out, I acted like everything was fine initially, but the next day I had a panic attack, and I told her I needed some space. We haven't talked in a few days. I know she's upset. 

I don't even know if this is the right place to post this. I'm anxious, angry, elated, and depressed, at various times through out the day. I take my anxiety meds as needed, but they don't do much. I had one of my best friends take my handgun to hold onto for now. I'm not suicidal, I don't have ideation or anything, but I've never been so stressed in my life, and I know all it takes for anyone is one bad night followed by one bad decision.

 I'm 27 years old, and all my friends have paired off, had kids, bought houses, and generally moved on with their lives, though they still try to make time for me. But it's not enough. I was so ambitious, and I had so many plans, and now they are so much dust in the wind, as I try to figure out how I can survive without getting left in the poorhouse. 

What do you do when it feels like the rest of the world is just passing you by, and your reservations keep you from reaching out? 
 
How do you date when you have cancer???
""Hi, nice to meet you, I could theoretically die at any time because my meds might just stop working, wanna grab a drink?"" That's technically true for anyone, one could get hit by a bus tomorrow, but by virtue of even having cancer, if someone knows about it, and they see me, I guaran-damn-tee the first thing they think about is my mortality, followed shortly by their own. 

Lol. This is fucked. I don't smoke. I don't drink. My cancer is the result of a genetic mutation that occurs in like 5% of cancer patients. I'm like the shittiest X-Man ever haha. CANCER-MAN! I was working on losing weight and being healthy. I've kept up with that since treatment and I've actually reached a personal best for my weight, but I still have a long way to go. My cancer and drugs make me fatigued as all get out. I'm just tired. I haven't had a decent night's sleep in months. 

Thanks for listening reddit. Sorry for the long post. I just have to keep at it, keep my nose to the grindstone.
 I'll get through it, I have to.

910,12rWindEngineer,1525152756,8g64lb,0,"I lost my twin brother last week to lymphoma at just 29 years old. I was sitting next to him. His head was on my shoulder. One second he was sleeping, the next he was just\- gone. It's been 8 days. 8 incredibly long, miserable, horrible days. To say I'm not handling it well is an understatement, which I guess is what brought me here. My brother always liked reddit. Said it would made him laugh, or forget about problems. I don't know, I always thought people online were mostly jackasses \(no offense to any here\) but I guess my brother just always brought out the best in people. He could find the good in everyone, find the joke in anything, zero in on the people he could horse around with and make everything a party. His reddit name was photonstravellight. I never even had to make my own account, my brother would cherry\-pick the best stuff almost every day and send it to me. Made for a lot of laughs. Gonna have to do that myself now, I guess. Even had to go and make my own account for the very first time, which just seemed surreal. I'm sad, and upset, and angry, and I alternate between wanting to break things and wanting to just sit in the corner and rock myself. My brother didn't deserve this. I'm the asshole, it should have been me. My brother had a future. He was a brilliant physicist. He played a mean fiddle. He always put me playing on my guitar to absolute shame. He was kind, and thoughtful, and genuinely cared about everyone he came in contact with. I would gladly take his place. It should have been me. I did 3 tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, I should have been the one to die. Not him. He was by far a better person than I will ever be. At his very core he was a good person. Seeing him struggle though brutal treatments for 2 years and not be able to do a damn thing was a nightmare, but I thought it was a means to an end. I always thought someway, somehow, he would succeed just on sheer stubbornness. And even worse has been to see most of our mutual friends seem like they barely care. They mostly abandoned him when he was diagnosed \(including his girlfriend at the time\), the few that stuck around seemed to give up on him in his final few months and mostly stopped talking to him. Then they all pretended like they suddenly cared when he died. And then carried on with their lives the very next day, like absolutely nothing happened. Like he was just a speed bump in their lives. I always took for granted that having an identical twin meant I'd have a friend, a shoulder to cry on, someone to have my back, someone to play pranks on, \(potential organ donor?\)\- for my whole life.

I'm trying to be strong and support her but I'm so scared and depressed. I don't know what to say to her, or how to act around her. I'm always worried that I'll say the wrong thing or do something to upset her. It's so bad that I've barely spoken to her over the past week because I'm so terrified that I can't handle this.

I had a really bad period of depression last year and tried to kill myself three times, and now I'm just getting out of it and moving on from what happened and now this is happening and I'm worried that I can't handle it. I don't want to hurt myself but I'm so worried about her, too. I want to be there for her every step of the way like I always have, but I don't know if I can. I'm eighteen. I'm just a kid, like I'm not ready for prepared or equip to deal with something like this. I love her so much, but I don't know if I can watch her die. 

I feel like my distance is hurting her. And I hate that and I hate myself for hurting her, but I just don't know what to do. The world is so unfair for doing this and I think it's going to kill me watching her go through this. She and I have been inseparable since we were eight years old and we've always faced everything together. From playing hockey together, to her helping me come out as a lesbian to my parents, etc. We've always been so close and I don't that to change but I'm so fucking scared that I'm going to end up trying to hurt myself again.

my boss and good friend got diagnosed with lung cancer, he started chemo immediately.    
Problem is, i have no further information because he avoids to speak about it and generally didn't change much at all except stopping to smoke, thanks god. (still has terrible food/drink/sleep/work habbits)   

So my question is, if there is solid information on how to adapt to prolong life as much as possible. Like nutrition-lists, exercise or anything at all which is known to help in that regard.    

I never was confronted with this and the web is overloaded with info so it is hard for me to inform myself. If someone maybe has links in english or even german language i'd be very thankful.

That latest round of chemo wrapped up at the end of last year and the nodules had shrunk; his latest scans show they have grown again. 

He trusts his oncologist but has asked me to help him research second opinions as the realization has set in that while chemo may keep the cancer at bay, he will not be cancer free. I think he wants to have a broader conversation about what the time ahead will look like, however long that turns out to be. He has just reached a point where he is starting to think about timelines and what that will look like. \(Just to armchair psychologize, I think he has been disassociating pretty hard for the past couple years and just waiting for it to go away.

He is relatively young \(early 60s\) and extremely healthy apart from the cancer. They are testing the tumor to see if immunotherapy is an option. 

Should we be looking for specialists in ampullary/bile duct cancer? Should we be seeking out someone who can more generally advise about life with ongoing chemo treatments? How does one search for such a person? Can anyone here point me toward resources for that kind of thing? Most of what I find online is about initial diagnosis/surgery.

We used protection btw. and then something started growing in my ovary area. Thought i might be pregnant, but like i said we used protection and tests came back negative. So I went to the doctor and a tumor completely ate my left ovary, about a month after having sex. Turns out I had a germ cell tumor...

My doctor said they don’t know how or why I got cancer, but then again my oncologist (and even my gyno onco, only my reg doctor) knows that i had sex before hand bc my parents are always in the room every single appt:/ My theory is I always had a tiny tumor or something and having sex annoyed it and caused it to grow.

I am a little scared because i’ll be going into college in august and I don’t want to worry about getting cancer again. According to scans, I have cysts on my right ovary, but they’re v normal. My cancers been gone for about 7 months. Of course this is something I should ask my doctor (and I will) but i was curious if any of y’all know anything about this? Couldn’t find a lot on the internet.... Thanks!!

So my sister has stage 2 breast cancer and got a port put in a bit over a month ago.  

She's always found it annoying but lately it's been really bothering her.  She says it's uncomfortable (because of pressure where the scar tissue is??) more than outright painful. I think it's the tightness of the skin that's bothering her. She has lidocaine gel for it but she says that it doesnt usually help as she finds the pain/discomfort more subdermal and the gel isn't doing a good enough job getting to that location.

I was wondering if any of you have had the same issues and if you've found anything that helps? Maybe gently messaging the area so it loosens and doesn't feel so tight? I'm not sure.


Also side note, have any of you gotten a pimple looking thing on the stitch line before? It just happened today and her surgeon friend said not to worry about it. I was wondering if it's a stitch trying to come through? I told her to put antibiotic cream on it.

Any help would be appreciated since she's gonna have it in for a few months at least.

His original diagnosis was follicular lymphoma that transformed in Large Diffused B Cell.  He was 1 day away from a stem cell transplant last year but there was too much active disease.  In the fall he was accessed for the Car-T trial but was denied for his PET not showing enough disease.

The FDA approval of Yescarta came in October and MD Anderson started making it available.  After jumping through so many insurance hoops, his T cells were harvested and sent to the lab in California in late February.  Once the cells came back, He had 3 days of outpatient chemo and then was admitted for the Car-T infusion.  

The room was full of nurses, doctors, research fellows, the pharmacist and my daughter, her husband and me.  It took less than 20 minutes and was quite anticlimactic!  The nurses told him to keep a mint in his mouth to ward off bad tastes and then we began to smell creamed corn.  The smell hung around for a few days especially when he was taking walks.

There are 2 major side effects to worry about so his vital signs were closely monitored.  He also had to answer 10 questions (date, where are we, count backwards from 100 by tens) and write a sentence to check for neurological changes.  He had to do these answers and write the sentence over and over daily for 9 days.  

On the 3rd day he developed a fever of 101 degrees.  The staff sprang into action with chest X-ray, antibiotics, lab tests, and a cooling blanket.  The fever didn’t last long and he was discharged on the 9th day.

He had to stay close to the hospital for a total of 30 days (and no driving for 60 days) so we stayed in one of medical apartments in walking distance.  

He had a PET scan on Tuesday and we finally got the results this morning.  He’s in remission and we got to go home.  His home oncologist will do labs every couple of weeks and back to Houston in 3 months for follow up.

His fingers and nose were black and blue. I did not speak to him because a day after being admitted he was unresponsive and I knew it wouldn’t make a difference. The doctors told me he had over a 90% chance of success but he fell in the other 10%. His body gave up at 53 but I never gave up on him. I last saw my father as a man lying in a hospital bed but that’s not who he was and I certainly don’t remember him that way. He was stubborn. He hated hospitals. That’s probably why he left so soon.

She also made me an emergency contact and gave me access to all of her medical information.  She will be going through chemo and radiation. 

So I have three questions for everyone here: 

1. Should I just keep taking her lead? She’s been sarcastic and cracking jokes. Asking my opinion on wigs and laughing when I tell her she needs a pink mohawk.  Telling me they stuck a water balloon where she used to have a boobie. I mean, it’s healthier this way, right? She isn’t despairing. 

2.  How can I make it easier on my dad? She won’t let me be too involved because I have young children and, in her mind, their well being comes before everything. But I know he’s terrified and could use support. His birthday was after her diagnosis, and we celebrated by bringing cake and balloons and all that party stuff.

For reference, I was diagnosed with stage 1b liposarcoma in my right bicep on March 28, 2018.  The tumor was removed March 15, 2018. They did a CT after to see if it had spread to my lungs, and found enlarged lymph nodes and nodules in my lungs.

Over the years, I've done a bit of research and have learned a few basic tenants of cancer.
1) Cancer mutates healthy cells.
2) Cancerous cells propagate through the affected organ(s) in a mycelial fashion.
3) Cancer thrives in acidic environments.
4) Susceptibility to cancer largely depends on environmental factors like diet, levels of physical activity, and carcinogenic exposure.

How accurate are these basic tenants? Are any of these flat out incorrect? If so, please do correct them. If these are mostly correct, can you think of any other major basic necessary conditions for cancer to propagate its way through the body until it accomplishes its goal of terminating the host? Is anybody able to elaborate on these generalizations of cancer, or point to sources that talk about them in more detail?

I've always been interested in making connections between two seemingly different things, whether they are tangible or otherwise, I love finding common ground. I know there are different types of cancer, but they all essentially do the same thing; completely destroy its host. Are there any organizations dedicated to finding commonality between all forms of cancer to better understand how it could be prevented and possibly reversed? 
I can't help but draw a connection between cancer and mold. Have there been any studies that draw this connection as well? Any help is much appreciated.

And in January I was diagnosed with stage 3 pre\-cancer, which is the final stage before it becomes cancer. Thankfully it's still pre\-cancer, but I have weekly doctor's appointments and am doing treatments which is very tiring. I went to an appointment the other day, where my oncologist explained to me she that thinks I need to reduce my hours at work, or she recommended talking to my boss about a ""Flexible Work Schedule"".

I can’t say I don’t agree, because I’ve been exhausted all the time since starting treatment. But, I have no idea how to go about talking to my boss about it. Has anyone else asked for a flexible work schedule at a 40/hrs a week job before?

When researching how to ask for a more flexible schedule many articles stated that I should point out to my boss how this will “benefit him and the company” but it’s honestly just so I can get more sleep and have less stress in my life.

My boss knows I’ve been diagnosed with this, and has been very understanding about my having to leave early at least once a week for appointments. I fear that my asking to come in later and leave earlier, PLUS one day where I work completely from home, will be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.

I’m not sure exactly how to go about this, but I can’t mess it up. If I go in unprepared and ask for this and my boss says no I’m not sure how I’ll proceed? I need a job, so I can’t quit. Yet, my oncologist is an oncologist for a reason! She wouldn’t talk to me about it unless she believes it will significantly increase my health.

1014,joedang1,1525747351,8htcsg,2,"Clinical cancer research have made large strides in the fight against cancer. Still, the National Cancer research center \(NCI\) estimates that there will be an astonishing 1,658,370 new cases of cancer in 2015. From a global standpoint, cancer is also one of the leading causes of premature death.

Early detection of this disease increases the chances of successful cancer treatment. Although the warning signs and symptoms in this post might not necessarily mean cancer in all cases, you shouldn’t neglect them.

There are over 200 cancer types, the most common being lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate, bladder,ovarian, kidney \(renal\), colorectal, endometrial and pancreatic cancer, as well as leukemiaand melanoma.

For most of these types of cancer, the survival rate is poor, especially forlung cancer. The reason is the late detection when the cancer is already in advanced stage, which impedes the treatment process.

Take a look at some of the most common signs and symptoms of cancer. In case you experience them, make sure you address them properly.

## 10. Unexplained Weight Loss

Once the cancer reaches the liver and disrupts its functioning associated with removing toxins and regulating appetite, it causes weight loss. But this can as well be a warning sign of digestive types of cancer, like colon cancer.

* 40&amp;#37; of all cancer patients report this warning sign at the time of diagnosis
* up to 80&amp;#37; of advanced cancer cases are experiencing cachexia \(general ‘wasting’\) and unexplained weight loss

Losing weight by watching your diet or exercising is normal. In all other cases, losing up to 10&amp;#37; of your weight, or up to 10 pounds a month in a 6\-month span is likely a cause for concern.

And so we'll rinse repeat this process until one of them starts negatively impacting me. The largest one is on my vocal cord, conveniently nestled between it, my tracea, and my spine. It's not touching my trachea or spine yet, but once it does then they want to do the surgery. Could be a month, could be ???? No way to tell. 

Waiting for surgery preserves my quality of life (surgery will damage the vocal cord) but it is really stressing me out. I understand why we're waiting but I can't quiet that part of my mind that just wants it GONE. The last 6 months waiting for this scan was hard enough with nothing to be done about it. Now I have to do this anxious waiting all over again. How do you deal with doing nothing? It's making me crazy. ",Wait and watch?

About me: I was diagnosed with Stage 1 Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in August, completed 6 rounds of R-CHOP chemotherapy by January and 15 sessions of radiation by March.

In April I had my first CT scan post-chemo and was praying for some good news (remission). I originally had an appointment with my oncologist on May 17th to discuss the results however on Friday she called me to let me know that she would now like me to complete a PET scan.

Apparently, the CT scan showed that no new tumors had formed, however she was worried about activity from the original tumor. When I was first diagnosed, I was told that my tumor was particularly dense making the effectiveness of the chemo more difficult.

This has left me with so many questions as I scramble for more information.

1) Is it common for people to have a PET scan done after their first CT scan?
2) What is the likelihood of my tumor still being ""active""?
3) Assuming it is active, what would be my next steps? Is more chemo still an option? Clinical trials?
4) Does this affect my survivability of cancer?

I signed up online with my hospital to have my CT images sent to me by email, as I simply am too stressed to wait until my meeting with my oncologist. I'll likely have the images on Monday - does anyone know the types of things that I should be looking for?

Sorry for the frantic post - in reality, I am hopefully looking to hear from someone who has been in a similar position and the actions that they took upon hearing the news.

Thanks,

Every time she tries to get in touch with NPOs (such as the American Cancer Society and local charities), they send her on a wild goose chase for resources because sometimes she just doesn’t have enough money for food each week. They give her a list of numbers to call. Each place says they are dry of resources or gives her even more numbers, and the cycle continues.

I just want a place where I can write something down it doesn't even matter to me if anyone reads it or responds.

On Wednesday, an internal medicine doctor told me I had hodgkins lymphoma. He wasn't sure what stage exactly but it was early - either 1 or 2. And I didn't show any B symptoms. The main symptom I had was itching that started in my hands and around my anus (not the anus itself around it) in early January. The anal pruritus eventually stopped but hand would still occasionally itch. 

In the beginning of January, I was in my last semester of my degree and in lecture I held a pen to write notes but I had to drop it because it started itching so much. It did eventually reduce but end of March the itching came back and it was worse than ever.

This time it would be on various parts of my body and worse at nights. I made an appointment with my family doctor for the first time in 7 years. He gave me a lab requisition but no medication. I was hoping for sleeping pills so I could sleep and thought to myself that he didn't care about my problem. In his defense, I did downplay the itching - I always try to be a stoic even when I shouldn't. 

I got the tests done the next day and two days later I spoke to a pharmacist who recommended Benadryl and it was effective.

Anyways, 6 days after the test was done a second doctors appointment was made. My doctor noticed swelling above my collarbone and on the lower neck - both sides. He told me to go to the emergency room.

A bunch of blood tests were done in the ER and an X-Ray, I was let go, a week later biopsy, CT scan, and ultrasound.

Blood test showed several things but monospot was negative. I think that's important to state.

I thought the ""chemo brain"" would be better by now, and at the beginning of the semester I was doing alright, but it felt like my brain just got thicker as the semester went on, and by the end I was failing things left and right whereas at the beginning I was blasting through tests and assignments with high 90s.

Has anyone else experienced ""chemo brain"" or cognitive difficulties long after chemo ended?

1062,_DOA_,1525443168,8gzjo5,6,"My wife and I were returning from a trip to see family in the Northeast, in January, and we sat on a bench to rest while waiting for a connecting flight. I didn't mean to hear this, or know this, but I did, because of where we chose to stop walking, when we did.

A woman in her 30's stood a few feet away and made a phone call, to her husband. I heard her say she got the results, and then she began crying softly. She said, ""This isn't the best way to have this conversation, I wish you were here."" She said, ""It will be different, but we'll get through this."" She mentioned a child at some point. They talked a couple minutes, and she said ""I'll see you when I get home. I love you, too."" 

I wondered what the odds were that I'd be standing in that spot, at that time, and hear that conversation. I wanted to tell her that we were on the same journey, and ask if she had any questions. I wanted to give her a hug. I didn't do any of that, because I was sitting there crying myself, behind my sunglasses, and imagining a time my wife had to make similar phone calls, stuck in my own pain, and I wasn't a picture of encouragement for anyone at that moment.

So, to the lady in the airport, please forgive me for my accidental eavesdropping on your conversation, and forgive me for not at least trying to ease your pain in that moment. And also thank you, for reminding me we're not the only ones going through this, and not the only ones who need help sometimes.

1066,forestcall,1525433023,8gyhko,12,"I would like to get peoples opinion on what diet they think is the best and why.

Please outline your diet in a typical 24 hour period.

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

BASE: Ketogenic \(deep ketosis\) with an emphasis on low protein, low carbs, high fat, extremely low inflammation foods.

* 18\+ hour daily fasting
* Wake and drink butter \+ tea or coffee \(we have kids\)
* Green drink around 1pm \(multiple freeze dried super powders\)
* 1\-2 lightly fried eggs in butter around 2pm \- 3pm
* Massive green salad around 6pm
* Throughout the day we consume about 12 tablespoons of various organic oils for energy.
* 40\+ different vitamins such as D3, Vitamin\-C, Olive Leaf Extract, Magnesium, Senna, etc.
* Total carbs per 24 hours = 20 carbs
* Total protein per 24 hours = 20
* Total fats per 24 hours = 12\+ tablespoons \(flaxseed, avocado, fish, sesame, olive, coconut, etc.\)

Note: I am writing this in the simplest possible way because I can't take the time \(at this moment im swammped with work, family, etc.\) to get more detailed and specific. After trying many different diets Budwig, Gerson, etc. my wife and I  started to realize how much work was involved in these diets. We also got deeper into how cancer cells grow. In a nutshell cancer cells mutate non\-cancer cells that were damaged while repairing inflammation in the body created by carbs, glucose, hormone imbalance, etc. Several other factors contribute to cancer cell growth and mutation such as excessive protein intake which flips on the MTOR growth switch. Autophagy which occurs more easily during a daily intermittent fast of at least 18\+ hours per day plays a vital role in the destruction of cancer cells.

Satsuki my wife \(we live in Japan\) was diagnosed with late stage 4 endometrial cancer that spread to her lymph nodes, lungs and bones. After meeting with many doctors, all of whom told us to prepare for death and other than surgery there was nothing to do as chemo and radiation would make her last weeks miserable. We were also told that she could eat whatever she wanted as food had nothing to do with healing cancer. We have 2 young kids age 4 and 7 so we could not give up. Satsuki had a full hysterectomy and started to heal. We spent a few weeks trying different diets but were not convinced these diets would work. We quickly learned that she needed to avoid carbs and protein. Budwig and Gerson for example was entirely based on carbs and Gerson went as far as to strongly suggest fat avoidance. Now just 18 months later Satsuki is completely cancer free, at least as far as all possible tests indicate. Satsuki has introduced her diet to several people in Japan who also have had startling success. A close neighbor with 4 very young kids was told he had lung cancer with 3 months to live. He had 1 lung removed and within 2\-3 weeks of being on this diet he was remarkably healthier. Now 4 months into this diet his doctors are astonished with his healing and massive reduction in cancer.

We are confident we are on to something. I feel confident that this diet should be the VERY FIRST thing someone does when they are diagnosed.  The obvious physical change in health is visibly apparent in the first week.

For those who have hater / negative comments I just want to ask.....why? Why not try this diet if your life depends on healing. And before anyone says the science does not support such a diet please check out Dr. Ron Rosedale,  *Peter Attia*, M.D.  among many others.",Diet survey,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8gyhko/diet_survey/,1525454623.0,2018-05-04 06:23:43

My mum (59) was admitted to the hospital due to bad jaundice and generally feeling unwell back in March.
After numerous tests the doctors told us about a mass in her gallbladder but they weren’t sure if it was cancerous unless a biopsy was performed. She got better after a week and was able to come home, a biopsy via endoscope was done and a week later that came back as inconclusive albeit almost in the clear.

The specialist booked her in for another biopsy in a weeks time and the morning of she ran a fever and started throwing up so we went back to the hospital where they ended up admitting her. 6 days later the doctors were finally able to perform another biopsy and extract a tissue sample of the mass and she was cleared to come home and await the results.

2 days after the biopsy, this afternoon I get a call from my mum that the doctors want her to come in to discuss options next week, basically the mass is a tumour and it’s cancerous, also that it’s incurable and the kicker - it’s terminal.

At this point it’s inoperable, seems to be in a precarious area inside the gallbladder, operating is far too risky. Because it’s cancerous/terminal we are going to speak with the oncologist and co to look at treatment options to slow down the growth. 

My mum is otherwise her normal self.

His lung and the small mass he had on his other kidney didn't light up, but his throat, left axillary lymph nodes, one superclavicular lymph node, and his spine between L3 and L4 did. He went to an ENT specialist who determined the spot in his throat that lit up was nothing.

At least I finally stopped getting fucked over by not being prescribed opiates for my debilitating back pain, I had a work related injury that just so happens to be right where the growth is and they were reluctant to prescribe anything since its ""workers compensation."" 



I need some advice and hope. I have my bone marrow biopsy coming up next week, and my first therapist appointment tomorrow. I still need my lung test and heart ultrasound, which scares me to see what they might find since I've only gotten bad news back. 


Has anyone been down a path similar to mine? Even if you haven't I would like to hear from people and their respective journeys.

Ok so my story goes like this. My father died of lung cancer in 2006 when I was 17. He got the message in Mars and died in July. So it all happened very quickly. Then my grandfather died of almost the same diagnosis of lung cancer the year after(mother side). My mom got breast cancer the year after that, but survived and had to remove one breast. Then it took a couple of years and my grandmother(mother side) past away from a cancer I do not remember the diagnosis of.

My mother then got a new cancer diagnosis the year after my grandmother died. Ovarian cancer. She had an open stomach surgery (sorry if my words isn't correct but English is not my native language.) after they found out. Now shes been going in and out for two years with different chemo therapies. Oh and in the meanwhile my grandmother from my father side died of cancer last fall. 

My mother has been strong all the way and also positive. Despite losing both parents, husband and her own breast after the last cancer diagnosis. But now its going downhill, and fast. She hasn't been able to eat for 3 weeks now and getting thinner by the minute.  She is not positive anymore (understandable but heartbreaking) and maybe she cant take next chemo because lack of nutrients in her body. 

I am mad, lost for words, angry and sad. That my sweet mother has to endure all of this shit in her life in just a 10 years span. She is a lovely woman who has many friends, and animals have always loved her. She loves gardening and interior. She is the strongest person I know of. And now I come to realize that she will not be spending the next Christmas or maybe experience my 30th birthday in August. I am glad I have my 7 year older sister who is a nurse. But we have been through hell for 12 years now, it needs to stop for my own sanity. ",I need to vent.,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8jxjai/i_need_to_vent/,1526518880.0,2018-05-16 14:01:20

This morning she said, ""I want you to help me."" 

Do what? I asked.

""I want to die now. I can't take it anymore.""

Crap. I tried to calm her down, but to no avail, until the drugs kicked in. I even mentioned that you and Karen wanted to see her again, but she basically said she didn't care because it was just too much for her.

1108,IsFullOfIt,1526474544,8julmk,5,"My mom has all of the signs of anaplastic cancer. It’s very rare, and the biopsy was inconclusive, but her Dr (a very experienced oncologist) has basically told her to be prepared. They’re taking the tumor out at this moment and I’m in the surgical waiting room - once it’s out they’ll be able to diagnose which type of cancer they have but she has all the textbook signs of the worst. 

From what I understand, anaplastic has a very poor outlook - it’s pretty much a no survival rate. It just spreads aggressively all over her body and her organs shut down. It’s very painful way to go and I can’t even think about her suffering like that. She’s the only family I have. 

I’m just waiting now. The waiting sucks. I’m preparing myself but it’s rare enough that I can’t talk to anyone who has been around it before. I know they would normally put her through a very aggressive radiation/chemo combination to try to prolong her life for a little bit but it feels horrible and usually has no effect on prognosis from what I understand. 

I don’t know what I can do to help. There’s the biggest cancer centers but they always want to push for any experimental procedure they can because they do research - the opportunity for subjects with anaplastic cancer doesn’t come up often. I just don’t know what to do. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? What can I expect? Was there any attempt to treat it or just palliative? This is just all happening so fast and I really don’t know what to do.

She suffered a lot and it absolutely destroyed me and what is left of my family. I have lost many close family members in a short amount of time to cancer and I am having terrifying symptoms myself that have thrown me into full blown panic mode. I can’t stop crying for more than a few minutes and I am already jumping to the worst case scenario for myself. 
I’m a 25 year old female and I take really good care of myself, exercise, am vegetarian, take vitamins, but still feel so sick. 

For the last few months my lymph nodes behind/under my armpits have been hurting a LOT especially in the morning. It’s a sharp/sore pain. I wake up with night sweats and a fever a few times per month accompanied by a headache and extreme fatigue. Some days I feel completely ok and can do yard work, exercise, and party with friends. Other days I am too exhausted to get out of bed and need at least 16hrs of sleep. If I drink alcohol, I have to sleep the whole next day and am pretty sore all over. I also have extreme sharp pain in my neck and shoulder at times and all around tenderness especially in my breasts. 


I have chronic fatigue syndrome brought on by the Epstein Barr virus (mono) 6 years ago, as well as fibromyalgia. I thought maybe my symptoms are related to these, but the more I read about lymphoma, the more I fear that is what I have. My uncle had non had non Hodgkin’s lymphoma when he was my age too and it definitely runs in the family. 

 This isn’t a “is this cancer?” Kind of post - I finally made a doctors appointment this Friday after being too scared to do it for months to get professional opinion. I have extreme trauma around anything medical and have been in therapy for it for months. I feel so scared and lost. I don’t have a support system to help me through this if it is cancer. I fear the treatment/chemo will completely ruin me like it did my mom. I watched her dissolve into a shell of a person within weeks of starting radiation and chemo.  


I worry about having to quit my job and let my clients down. I know treatment can be intense and I don’t know if people can realistically work during that. My job is very physically demanding. I know the survival rate is good for lymphoma, but what if it’s something worse... Breast cancer and brain cancer are also very common in my family. I know I am jumping to worst case scenarios already but my panic brain won’t stop going a mile a minute. I don’t know exactly why I’m posting, maybe just hoping for any sort of comfort or reassurance or someone who has been through something similar. Sorry for rambling.

my main reason for posting now is that her insurance is denying her coverage for one of the meds, Neulasta, which is manufactured by Amgen. Has anyone else experienced this, or had other issues with billing when it comes to cancer/insurance? my mom is covered under my father's policy, which is through United Healthcare and i don't know too much about that carrier, though i'm doing a lot of research now. basically i'm just trying to get ahead of all my mom's bills so she doesn't have to stress about it. we don't have a lot of money and i know she's already worried about all this, so i have to try to help anyway I can. 

for those who want to know more about my mother: she got diagnosed with cancer on March 8th. initially we were told she'd only need surgery to remove her stomach and no chemo or radiation, but that was because they didn't find all the cancer with the first set of tests.  a second scan revealed that unfortunately my mom's cancer has spread to some of her lymph nodes, which is why they started her on chemo first. she is on her 3rd week (of 12), after which (hopefully) she will be well enough to undergo surgery to remove her whole stomach. then she will have a round of chemo AND radiation, and then finally, another round of chemo to hopefully put her in remission. 

this is incredibly scary in itself because FUCK CANCER, but my mom is my best friend and the glue that holds my family together. it hurts me so much to see her suffer and to have her worry. PLUS my father has cancer (inactive lymphoma since 2013 so he gets bloodwork done every so often, and has everything checked to make sure he's ok and if he is, he repeats this again in a few months) and now her mother, my maternal grandmother, just got diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer.  know my mom's lightweight losing her shit as she goes through her own personal hell, aka treatment, so i have to step up and help where i can.

The cost of lab work, including pap smear, biopsy, etc. is not factored into that. The lab bills those separately, and the gyneclogist's office can not give the cost of any of these tests. 

My mother in law says her neighbor says that the costs are all covered by the state once you get diagnosed with cancer, but you are responsible for all bills leading up to diagnosis. I call bullshit on that, because the state doesn't pay for my Sz medical bills.

1139,AfroMonkey010,1526335305,8jgaze,27,"Hi everyone. Just wanted to share my story because I'm really alone and don't have many friends.

2 months ago, I lost my jeep in an explosion, went through a break-up and then was diagnosed with stage II testicular cancer all within the same week.

I found this sub today and am filled with emotion just reading everyone's stories. I'm scheduled to begin chemo next week after I have a port placed in my chest on friday. I'm 23.

Cancer showed me how little I know about this world. How little I know about what's correct or incorrect to do with your life or even your next week.

However, I decided that the purpose of life is to love those around you. And I am sitting here on my laptop at a cafe in seattle with tears welling up and I wish I could hug each and every one of you. I don't know you but I still feel a connection. I don't know what the point of this post was. I suppose I just felt the need to spill my soul. I've been very reserved with my diagnosis, only telling my close friends and my family. I deleted my social media accounts. So, to have a place where I can talk about my diagnosis and not feel like it's some sort of fucked up 'bragging' or dick-measuring contest is so relieving.

The worst part of cancer for me is seeing people's reactions when I share my diagnosis. Why did I have to be the one to bring sadness into someone else's life? I would much rather make someone smile or laugh. :( In that respect, I would rather not tell someone so that they can continue in happiness rather than be emotionally unbalanced because of my life. I do not wish to cause worry in anyone's life.

I don't know why there is so much pain in this world. But all things come to an end and whether we live or die, if we love those around us we are doing the right thing and no one can take that away from us, no one.

So to everyone reading this, let's spread our love as much as we can to everyone who will have it. Our love will never die :)",A personal story,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8jgaze/a_personal_story/,1526356905.0,2018-05-14 17:01:45

Look, I don't know what lies ahead for me. I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer at the end of February this year after a bout of nightmarish stomach pain. I'm 28 years old. Asian. Gay. Male. 

Just let me whine, please. I'll be ok after. I'm not even the type to complain, really. Life gave me lemons from the very beginning--not just recently. I can ask why me over and over, but, in the end, who am I compared to everyone else? I'm not special. Just another ant delivering food to its colony. The better question is, why not me?

Sometimes I wonder if I'm being tested. That some omnipotent being is looking down on me, placing obstacles in my path, and just waiting with bated breath for me to crack. I won't crack though. The cancer will have to fight me until my very last breath. Until my body becomes etched with reminders of my condition. Until my breath becomes labored with exhaustion. Until my eyes become too heavy to open. I will not surrender. 

My life has tempered me like a sword. It wasn't easy being gay growing up. In fact, I tried to kill myself at the ripe age of 11 after a period of despondency from feeling rejected at school and at home. There was no way out at the time, it seemed, and euphoric fantasies of death lingered in my head. It felt less like jumping into something scary, and more like stepping into something warm and welcoming. 

Nothing happened, of course, and I never attempted again. Although passive thoughts have crossed my mind, I've made no plans though, so don't worry. Like I said, I'm a fighter now. 

There's a good chance I won't be around in five years. I know that statistic well because I think about it almost everyday. I suppose I'm supposed to be fine with ambiguity and uncertainty. Don't you know? It says so in the cancer handbook that we all get. I'm relying on my oncologist to know what he's doing. So far so good. The latest scan shows improvement. But. What about the next scan? And the next? They don't tell you about the uncertainty and the ambiguity when they diagnose you. 

Until then, I'll pretend like everything's fine when people ask me how I'm doing. I don't want them to carry any burden as they go back to their cancer-free lives.

My husband will having his asct next week for  relapsed Hodgkins lymphoma. We have had to hide  his relapse news from his parents for very valid reasons (his dad is barely recovering from a major stoke and won't be able to handle this etc). They don't live in the same country as us, but he is in the habit of speaking to them during his lunch hour for 10-15mins almost  everyday. He has managed to continue calling them through his pre conditioning treatments, (expect for a couple days when he just couldnt) 

He has given them a heads up that he will be on a work conference trip for 2 weeks later this month so he may not be able to call them as often. But not calling them at all for 2 weeks would definately raise suspicion.

Do you guys think he will be able to talk to them on the phone and pretend everything is ok (a quick call for 5 mins or so) say twice or thrice  a week during  his worst weeks of asct  (I hear day +3 to +15 are the worst). Or is that close to impossible? I understand everyone's experience is different and if it really comes to it, we would have to share the news with them. But we want to try as far as possible to shield them from any additional agony. 

Thank you for taking the time.

A bit of back story: I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 40. It was treated with surgery, chemo, radio, herceptin and tamoxifen. It was hard and I had extreme reactions to most of the drugs. I also got pushed into a dramatic menopause by the time of my second session of chemo.

It's taken nearly six years to get my life back in some semblance of normality. I'm working again but that's a challenge as I've got some neurological damage from the chemo (yay for chemo brain) and now need strict supervision. I'm still working on my finances which are a mess despite living in the UK so I get free treatment.

My hard menopause came with severe vaginal atrophy which took a lot of pushing to get diagnosed and then treated as  a major problem not just an annoyance. I am able to sustain a sex life but only with patience and understanding from my SO.

Anyhoo, about ten days ago I had the scan from hell, a hysteroscopy. NOTHING I've been through has been anywhere near as painful or distressing. It took repeated attempts to get some barely passable views. The nurse conducting it hinted that the next step may be a hysterectomy - which is fine, keyhole and a week recuperation. (note about the NHS nurses are often highly trained to conduct many procedures but any decisions have to be technically made by the doctors/consultants despite the fact that the nurses usually know before they pass it on. This means they can often give you a veiled hint about what may be next and are generally right).

She said I would be sent for an internal ultrasound to try to get a more comprehensive picture of what's going on and if they needed to redo the hysteroscopy I'd be sedated.

Last week I got a letter for the ultrasound Appointment for the end of the month. All well and good and to be expected. Last night I came home to find a letter changing the date. No problem I thought until I realised its to make it NEXT WEEK. This is pretty unheard of in the NHS. If they make it sooner its usually by phone to fill a cancellation.

So, it's Sunday, nobody is going to be available to talk to about the scheduling and I'm going into meltdown thinking they've found something and I JUST CAN'T DO THIS AGAIN! r/cancer I'm in bits.

1180,SMLLR,1526018751,8ilkhp,8,"I just need to vent a bit...

A few years ago, my Mom had a lumpectomy to remove a tumor. She then would go back for her yearly checkups to be sure nothing comes back, but she switched doctors as going down to UPenn is a huge hassle. Two years ago this new doctor found something, but wasn’t concerned about it and said they were going to keep an eye on it. They then said the same thing last year and the same thing again a few months ago. She lost confidence in the doctors and sought a second opinion back at UPenn.

Mere days after getting the second opinion, she is told she had to get a mastectomy. She was diagnosed with HER-2 positive breast cancer. As you could imagine, this absolutely infuriated me that the local doctor chose to sit on this knowing her history with breast cancer. Despite the grim diagnosis, the doctors made it seem she would be done with it after the mastectomy. Boy were they wrong....

During the surgery, they removed something like 13 lymph nodes and found cancer in 4 or 5 of them. This meant she now stage 3 and has to under-go chemo and radiation after getting a full body CT scan and a bone scan.

Fast forward to today, her first day of scheduled chemo. After driving all the way down to UPenn, she is told she will not be starting chemo today as they found two spots on her liver from the CT scan. She will now have to get an MRI to try to determine what the spots are.

What frustrates me is that they made her travel all the way down into the city to give her the bad news. To make things worse, they are making her drive down again tomorrow for the damn MRI!!! Why the hell wouldn’t they schedule the MRI so she can have it done right after receiving the news?! This is absolutely unacceptable to me. I know doctors can be overworked, but my Mom said it seemed like the doctor JUST looked at the results of the CT despite her having it done a week ago. Now we may potentially have to go through Mother’s Day not knowing if my Mom has stage 4 cancer or not.

My mom did everything right. She was sure to get her checkups every year, made her appointments and followed the doctor’s orders. All this, yet she just keeps getting bad news after bad news. I just want to scream at both of these doctors for what they are putting my family through with all this bullshit.

1186,MercenaryLord,1525995132,8ijath,19,"My mom has a cancerous tumor in her jaw. I don't know much more than that, as I'm a college student who is usually six hours away for most of the year. When I'm home, I don't really get to talk about the cancer with her, as it tends to result in a standoff that only would result in her doubling down on her decisions.

See, my mom's primary source of income and her major life devotion for the past ~5-8 years has been selling Juice Plus. I disagree with her on the effectiveness of it, but I avoid debating it with her. She was introduced to it a while ago by one of my relatives, and has become steadfastly infatuated with Juice Plus, naturopathy, and alternative medicines ever since. It's become progressively worse as time has gone on. She's heavily skeptical of vaccines, majorly ""anti-medicine"", and has so far been to several doctors to find one who believes the same things as her.

She's already had and beat thyroid cancer several years ago. I'm not sure what treatments she used then, but I know that she made it through. This time around, she's armed herself with all the worst possible information sources she could have found. The idea that cancer grows in an acidic environment, the idea that chemo and radio-therapies cause more harm to the body than it actually helps, etc.

She has basically started doing as many alt-medicine treatments as one could feasibly begin at the same time. She has started taking several ""alkaline"" supplements, she has been regularly seeing an ""energy doctor"", putting teabags in her mouth against the tumor, she is eating purely vegan and exercising more frequently (this one is not necessarily bad, I know, I know), and to top it all off, she spent a small fortune (thousands of dollars) on a BEMER machine. I haven't been able to find any proof that the damn thing works, but she seemed to find it totally justified.

I've done research on each of the things she tells me about her condition, and it's been so devastating and heartbreaking to see this all happen. She's got a master's degree in geology; one of the smartest people I know. But somehow, someway, she thinks all of the things she's been doing are totally true, and won't hear a word against them.

God, writing this is painful. I don't want to lose my mom, but I'm terrified that's what is coming. 

I'm scared, and I'm furious. I'm enraged about these people and these companies who can knowingly peddle cures which don't work. How DARE they prey on people afraid of death just to line their pockets.

Sorry for my ranting. It's something I've been struggling with for months. I obviously can't force her to change her mind or attempt more mainstream treatments, but I just don't know how to handle this.

I'm terrified I'm going to get a call one day about how the cancer has grown, metastasized, or damaged her further. But I'm angry that all of this is happening without even a tiny attempt at using proven methods to treat it. I don't even know if she's going to an oncologist at this point, or just the quacks.

1187,dvdmon,1525993589,8ij4rr,21,"So, I was wondering if anyone could provide some resources for navigating around a decision of whether or not to have chemo.

To explain as briefly as I can, my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer a couple of months ago, she had surgery (lumpectomy), and is considered low-risk.  She's based out of NYC and conferred with two oncologists, one from MSK (where she had the surgery) who recommended chemo, and one from NYU who said she didn't think it was warranted and had her get a Mammaprint test which also put her in the low-risk group.  She was leaning toward getting chemo but as she read more about the negative side effects and risks, she decided she should get yet another opinion, and that oncologist (from Mt. Sinai), said she'd shown her file to several others there and they all thought chemo was not warranted, would not give her much in terms of decreased risk of recurrence/spread/survival.

That last visit was just yesterday, and she decided based on that to just do radiation as well as drugs that shut down estrogen (she has estrogen positive cancer), which was recommended by MSK as an alternative to chemo.  But in talking to MSK today about the decision, they again said they still thought she should do chemo because Mammaprint is still an ""evolving"" test.  Which of course is making her a bit more hesitant that she made the right decision to stop.

As far as I know though she is still opting out of chemo, but I'm wondering if anyone had good resources for how to deal with differing opinions on chemo (or other treatment), and whether there's a way to feel more confident in going one way (whatever way that is).  I've been careful not to suggest she should do chemo or she shouldn't, but my mom hasn't been quite as ""diplomatic.""  I think it's important that she come to her own desicion and doesn't feel pressured by anyone - I think it's hard enough to have to deal with wondering if you made the right decision regardless of what it is!  I guess that's part of my question - is there any good info out there on how not to get bogged down about wondering whether you made the right decision, second guessing yourself, especially in a case where you are getting competing professional advise?  Maybe it's impossible, kind of like telling a clinically depressed person ""just get over it"" - and something people just have to come to terms with on their own?

Right now they are trying to make sure it doesn't come back.

Craniospinal radiation has been a killer. I've been hospitalized throughout, vomiting blood for the damage to my insides, and extremely fatigued. I've lost 22 pounds in 5 weeks. I have 1 more week to go. After this, they want to give me a month off to recover and then start a year of very heavy, platinum-based chemo. They said by completing this treatment, I'll have a 60-80% chance of it not coming back.

Considering how hellish this has been, i've decided not to do the year of chemo. I'm depressed and sick and weak and i want my life back. 60-80% doesn't comfort me too much either. My doctors are obviously pushing for the year of chemo, they've admitted they tend to ""overtreat."" (I'm at a top cancer facility).

Noticed a mark, like a red spot near my moles. It looked a little like a red mole, I've noticed it before and assumed it was a mole or something, and had always been there, but looking at some older pics from last year, this mark wasn't there. 

I scratched it a couple of days ago, and it bled - it hadn't bled before I messed with it - and it's now scabbed over, hasn't bled since. 

If it doesn't clear up I'll go the docs and get it checked out, but does this sound like I should be concerned?

It's about half a centimetere big, probably a little less, and where I've scratched it the area around has scabbed over a little.

1208,Elizabuddy,1527092601,8lkos6,45,"10 months ago I sat here, at my parents house when my world hit a stop. It was a beautiful summer day in July. We were outside. My mother had called me here to tell me something important. We waited for my brother to arrive. Then my father told us, that he was terminally ill with Stage 4 colon cancer. He had between a week and a year left to live according to the doctors. It has been a very tough battle, but full of hope, love and encouragement. And now it’s suddenly over. 


This morning at 3AM he died at the hospital. He was getting better, doing well and the tumor was shrinking. But he died. The cancer took him from me. He didn’t suffer. There was no pain. But it was so sudden, and we weren’t there with him. I wasn’t there with him. I was there a few hours before. I told him about my day, my new job, my new car, made sure he got his food and drinks and agreed with him that I would come the following day. I told him I love him, and then drove home. And now he is gone. I will never talk to him again, hear his voice or see his smile. I miss his jokes, his silly faces and his love. 


I was the apple of his eye; everyone keeps telling me how much he loved me. I just want to hold him and tell him, how much I love him. How much I already miss him. 


I have never known pain like this. It’s so surreal. It feels as if I am living in a parallel universe and at any moment I should be able to travel back to my own world. A world where he is alive and waiting for me. But I don’t know how to get there. My brain refuses to believe that he is gone. I keep thinking he is the one turning the doorknob or walking up the stairs. Then I hear my mothers crying voice in my head. “Dad is dead”. 


I am lost.

1210,LizardBurger,1527078348,8lixma,21,"Mom died. 

Actually, more than a year ago. May 4, 2017. 

In September 2015, she was diagnosed with Stage IV adenocarcinoma, a 7-centimeter tumor in her left lung and small specks of cancer in her right. She was only given eight months to live. 

By God’s grace, genetically she was a candidate for a clinical trial drug called Tarciva that stabilized the cancer for many months. We had all hoped the drug would shrink the tumor, but it only stopped it for a while. “Stable is a positive in our world,” the oncologist had said. 

In summer 2016, Tarciva stopped working and she began traditional chemotherapy. We were back on our eight-month timeline. I was at many of her infusions.

But there is no cure for Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Treatments only give you more time.

Mom had time to go on one last trip with each of her kids. My two sisters went to Mexico with her. My brother to Colorado. And I, at the final hour, in February 2017, went with her to San Francisco and Yosemite.

I was there with mom at the hospital for many of the downturns. When she had her needle biopsy and they staged the cancer and mom found out it was going to kill her. When Tarciva didn’t shrink but only stabilized the tumor. When the oncologist said all the treatment options had failed and the best chance for quality of life in the time she had left was to go home into hospice care and let cancer go.

I asked him how much time she had. He said, “Weeks to months.” If you’re counting, that’s two to eight weeks.

Mom lasted six.

I remember the first day she was home in hospice. One of her girl friends come over to visit. Mom talked with her for an hour, going on about this and that. I sat in a room off to the side listening to her talk, not the words, just the sound of her talking, and it was so pleasant remembering all the times as a kid growing up and listening to her talk on the phone with her friends.

She lost a lot of weight. She made it to her sixtieth birthday. In the end, she was a breathing skeleton. She started hallucinating. And in the last two weeks, she became less and less responsive. She spent her last three days sitting in a padded recliner with her arms folded on a desk in front of her and her head down. I think it was the only position that opened up her chest cavity to allow her to get enough Oxygen. 

An hour before her death, her breathing changed to a series of brief sniffs.

A minute before she died, I heard the sniffs catching in the back of her throat, and I knew the air wasn’t getting to her lungs. I told the rest of the family, “This is it.”

The five of us were there. I held her two hands in front. My brother was on her right. My sister was on her left. My dad and my other sister huddled over her further to the left. It was hard to tell when she took her last breath, but at some point, one of my sisters said, “I think she’s gone.”

When she died, everyone cried out loud; I remember specifically my dad and my brother, though.

But I didn’t. I went for a walk around the lake and my legs buckled beneath me every few steps.

I loved my mom.

All the people who knew and loved my family, some knew better than others, that there’s a sadness among our family that’s deeper than death and cancer. And the hurt is this: Decades of not-talked-about hurt and coldness and distance and missed conversations and lost time between my dad and mom. Loss of husband-wife warmth and relationship, all lived out under one roof but never reconciled. It was a real tragedy.

I was sitting beside my mom, just us two, when the oncologist told her it was time to go home into hospice. Dad came in and mom told him. I remember he audibly chocked back a sob, then he kissed her on the forehead, chocked back another sob, and kissed her on the forehead again.

After all the years of him keeping his emotions inside a fortress, I was shocked, *shocked* to see him cry.

I wish none of this had ever happened. I wish mom and dad had loved each other and been truly happy. I wish mom had never gotten cancer. I wish she hadn’t died.

The cyst was twisted 4 times which was causing the severe pain, and there was 1L of free fluid in my abdomen. At my follow up appointment 4 weeks later I was told that the cyst contained stage 1 cancer and I was sent for a CT scan. The CT has shown that a new 7cm cyst has already reformed so the recommended treatment is removal of both of my ovaries. I have requested a complete hysterectomy as there’s no point in leaving my womb in there now. They will be checking my abdomen to make sure nothing has been missed so will be cutting me open from the diaphragm down.


I'm finding it all very overwhelming at the moment - I'm more fucked off than I am anything else. I'm fucked off that I've got to start menopause at 32, I'm fucked off that I've got to be off work for another 2-3 months, I'm fucked off that I now can't go on holiday next month, and I'm fucked off about how it's going to ruin my body. I've really struggled to deal with just the lower abdomen swelling over the past 6 weeks; having my entire abdomen swollen along with a massive fuck off scar down the middle and separated muscles is going to mess me up a lot. The effect this is going to have on my body is literally the only thing I've shed a tear over.


I've never wanted to children so that isn't much of an issue to me but it still sucks that the choice has been taken away from me.

 -- Get a full scan run. 

 -- See how the cancer is growing (or not). 

 -- Decide to continue with current treatment or try a new treatment based on that information.  

 -- Wait 3 more months for another scan run.

 -- Repeat.

I have already been going through this so far this year (since my diagnosis at the end of last year), and I thought there might be an end in sight, but I was mistaken. I am trying to go to school, trying to work, but have been very limited with regards to both, and don't even get me started on trying to date.

There is no cure currently, and because its stage IV and my liver area is heavily involved, I am already committed to symptom medications consistently which cause their own side effects but at least prevent life-threatening symptoms from popping up. Treatments will likely consist of trying various drugs, chemo, and a liver transplant as a last resort (although that's just an endgame delay tactic and comes with its own risks). There may also be continued surgeries in certain areas, again, as a delay tactic.

HOW?

HOW do I live my life 3 months at a time endlessly waiting for the next scan run. It feels like I cant plan for anything because I never know if in 3 months the scans will result in a drastic change, or medication that has serious side effects, or surgery.

1219,emslo,1527032864,8les8e,7,"Has anyone else had this experience?

I have a team of two radiation oncologists, both treating my Stage 3B cervical cancer. At this point it has become a pattern that one of them (let's call her Good Cop) always emphasizes what's going *well* with my treatment, to the point of leaving the rest out. She did it at the start: Reassuring me that no, this wasn't cancer, and then, don't worry, you'll only need a hysterectomy, and so on. Last week after my brachytherapy, she happily announced that the tumor had really shrunk, ""We almost can't see it on the MRI!""

This week, I met with my second oncologist (I won't call her Bad Cop, but rather *Frank* Cop), who told me that yes, the tumor is definitely reducing: from 4 cm to less than 1 cm. However, the inflamed lymph node that we've been monitoring — the pelvic lymph node that pushes me up into Stage 3, which is the reason I'm having a full course of chemo &amp; radiation, the lymph node that makes everything scary because it means my cancer has metastasized — has not stopped growing. 

While I appreciate that Good Cop wants me to be optimistic and hopeful, I don't appreciate being misled, and that's what it feels like. I would have preferred to hear no update, rather than getting my hopes up for a week, only to get the full picture later. Now it's really hard to not interpret this as a step backward, even though my rational mind knows that it isn't. 

At this point, I've decided to discreetly ask Frank Cop if she can be the primary communicator for any updates and progress reports. I'm sure this isn't universal, because we all respond to and need different things when we're in these vulnerable states. But for me, I don't want an oncologist that is focussed on protecting me from the reality of my health — I want one that I can trust.

My mother was diagnosed with lungcancer which has spread to her lymfe glands and her brain membrane. She has had some radiation therapy, however, chemo is no option at this moment. She is physically and emotionally too weak according to the docter and I actually kind of agree with him. My mother at this moment can not walk more then about 20 feet on her own. Has minor seizures and can not reccolect half of her day at the end of the day. Next to this she has severe headache attacks where she screams violently.

My mothers boyfriend thinks she is ready to go home (She is in the hospital at this time) and get help from a homecare service and himself. I dont think this is a good idea seeing the seizures, the headache attacks and not knowing what she did for half of her day. On top of this my mum has incest past with her father sexually and physically hurting her over a decade, the pain meds bring on hallucinations to her past, so she isn't very friendly to male nurses. Whom unintentionally scare her. 

I am trying to discuss options for treatment and care with my mother and her boyfriend however, my mother can not talk about it ( it takes to much energie and she has told me she does not know whatbis best at this moment im time) and he has such a different view then I do. 

I'm at my wits end and starting to fall apart myself as well. I do not want to completely take over from my mom and her boyfriend but she is really hurting right now and I believe she needs medical help and rest and not a loving boyfriend and her daughter running out of energie and messing up her health. 

Has anyone here not seen eye to eye with another person about a loved ones care? Does anyone have input about what a person in my mothers situation might be feeling, thinking but not saying as not to hurt her loved ones.

1227,_hannabal_,1526998856,8lacbl,0,"Hi everyone! TL;DR at the bottom :) 

My dad is currently undergoing treatment for non-Hodgkins MCL (he came out of remission in 2015), and I was hoping some of you might have some suggestions as to what I could give him for father's day. 
He's... a unique individual, and he sometimes thinks he knows better than his doctors and doesn't always follow instructions. He doesn't give me too many details about how treatments are going or what drugs he's on... or much of anything really. I find it really hard to get him anything as gifts because he doesn't seem to want much. He does things the way he wants to do things even if it's harder on him, so often gifts I've gotten to help him don't get used or get used in weird ways. 

Right now he's on at least one medication, not sure what, and he's experiencing water retention (feet/calves especially, but also face), what I think might be ecchymosis on his arms (internal bleeding, looks like deep red bruises), and pretty severe fatigue. His oncologist said his blood counts are all fine, but he insists they're doing blood draws at the wrong time. He has had anemia before, but the doctors said they don't see signs of it, though they did say the ecchymosis was probably due to low blood counts? I don't know. He just doesn't tell me much of anything. I'm going on the assumption that his counts are in fact low since he has bruising and fatigue.

So I was thinking I'd get him some foods that could help with his low blood counts. He lives one state over and he's alone in his apartment, so he's had to do all his shopping and cooking himself. Which is obviously a problem when you're just too weak sometimes. The internet says foods high in iron, B12, folic acid, vitamin A, and copper can help with low blood counts. So I was wondering if any of you know of easy-to-make meals that have higher levels of those. Even microwaveable meals; he loves those because they're so easy and usually they're just the right portions. Last I heard, he's been eating a lot of ramen, frozen foods, and probably microwaveable Indian food, which isn't exactly the best for his situation. But I know it's just what's easiest. I'm a very picky eater myself so I don't know what all is out there. 


TL;DR: looking for low-effort food ideas that will help with my dad's low blood counts/water retention from his treatments; microwaveable or very easy prep is best. Or anything easy and healthy that he can eat that you have found helps you. Or just general father's day gift suggestions! He loves NYT crossword puzzles, watching the same movies and tv shows on Netflix, and apparently getting banned from astronomy forums for having his own crazy ideas about galaxies and being an old man on the internet.

It's in 6 vertebrae, her liver, and her right hip.   She's been on this 3rd battle since February of 2016.  She's been on a pill form endocrine chemotherapy for almost 2 years.

1236,lsdzeppelinn,1526952036,8l616q,10,"I don’t know the specifics of his cancer, how long he has, or what his chances are. Please no thoughts and prayers, I only came here because I want to organize my thoughts and vent a little. I don’t know if I have questions and if I do, I’ll put them below and feel free to answer them or react in general to whatever I say, just please no pity.

My dad is the worst person I’ve ever met. He is racist, homophobic, sexist, chauvinistic, he’s a pedophile, manipulative, abusive (physically and emotionally), and a lot of other things. Horrible person. From ages 6-12 I lived in a hostile environment, constantly waiting for him to suddenly explode, yell, curse, threaten to kill my mom, threaten to kill himself if we called the police. I’ve watch my older brother and sister have panic attacks and emotional breakdowns because of him.  We all had horrible childhoods and for many years I despised him. I blame him completely for many of the mental and emotional problems I have today. I grew up having 0 confidence in myself, I still deal with depression and severe anxiety. He has never apologized for the way he treated us, and he has absolutely no remorse for what he did, in fact he is constantly trying to guilt me into thinking that he never did anything wrong and that we were wrong for leaving him. 

When I was 12 me, my siblings, and my mom left one day without telling him and moved to the other side of the country. For many years after that, I harbored a lot of hate and anger towards him. I’m 18 years old now, and I’ve made my peace with him and what happened during my childhood. I never “forgave” him, I just learned how to deal with what happened, and it doesn’t bother me anymore. I have visited him a couple of times now and I talk to him occasionally, mostly because he pays my cell phone bill, and because my mom nags me to do so, some “he’s your father” bullshit. 

Today I found out that he has cancer. I don’t know much other than that its metastasized all over him body. I am sad that he has cancer. I am not as sad as I think I should be. I am graduating from high school in mid-June, and I plan to go to college in September. Over the summer, I have a lot of mandatory college related stuff that I have to do. Housing, orientation, placement tests, registration. Because of this, I have been seeing his sickness as more an inconvenience than something to be sad about, which brings me to the reason why I’m writing this post. I’m expected to visit him over the summer, and I’ll think i’ll be able to carve out 3-4 weeks to do so. It’ll suck ass and make everything harder for me, but I’m willing to do it. What worries me is that I won’t know what to do when I’m there. I love my dad, but I don’t care about him. Sickness or death don’t erase people’s sins. What he did to me and my family doesn’t bother me anymore, I’ve moved past all of that, but I can’t act like it never happened just because he’s sick now. So what do I do? I am being guilted by the rest of my family into talking to him all the time and acting empathetic when I don’t feel any empathy at all. If I had a choice between him having cancer and not, I would obviously choose not, but now that it’s already happened, I can’t bring myself to care. I do not feel bad about it, I am not broken up about it at all. How am I supposed to treat him now. If there really is a force like Karma, this is what he deserves. Am I an asshole for not caring? Im not going to treat him badly, I will try my hardest to at least not make his passing more difficult, but am I supposed to suddenly act like this man didnt make my existence hell for most of my formative years?

1243,texanpanda,1526914561,8l1ez5,2,"Hello everyone! 

My friend (and also my co-worker) was diagnosed with stage 4 endometrial cancer last month. It's been a very stressful and emotional journey for her so far, and it's only just beginning. 

She still has no idea when she starts chemo, but she already has her port. We're just waiting for MORE test results to come back first. 

She hasn't been to work in about 6 weeks or so, and she misses it terribly. Not only because she loves her job, but she misses her old routine. 

I told her we will try to find a way things feel comfortable. The problem is, we still don't don't when she starts treatment. They've told her she probably only needs to go in once a week for Chemo. I'm trying to find a way to make things feel as ""normal"" as possible for her, but I need ideas. I'm just at a loss. 

 I've already told her I'm taking her to Chemo whenever she wants me to. I've also told family I'm available whenever they call to come help, even if it's just sitting with her while she pukes. One day when she's up for it, I'm taking her to my mom's house (incredibly comfortable bed. Incredibly clean house) so she can have a little change of scenery. She loves the idea, and so does mom. (Mom and Dad are basically putting their lives on hold to take care of her. Completely understandable, but they need a break.) 

I'm thinking we can do a regular at home movie date where I can come over and bring a movie, nap, just a low key day. And maybe mom and dad can go on a date or something on those days as well. 

I've set up a meal train for the family (with her dietary restrictions), and work is putting together a chemo care basket for her (if you have any good ideas for this please let me know. I found port access shirts, we're getting blankets and socks. Chapstick, unscented lotion, teas, etc.) 

I'm trying to do whatever I can. We text almost daily, whenever she's up for it. I stop by whenever she's up for it. We talk about work, movies, anything she wants. We only talk about cancer if she feels like it. I always let her direct the conversation. 

I just feel like there's more I can do. I just don't know what. Other than just being there, which I'm trying to do as much as possible. 

Any ideas on how to make this stage of her life feel as comfortable or as ""normal"" as possible? We've talked about how she'll have a new normal for a while, but she just really misses having a routine that makes her feel like her old self. We're only in the beginning of this journey, so I'm trying to help her as much as possible in every way I can. 

I'm sorry this is so long. I didn't mean to ramble. And I hope this makes sense!!! Just trying to help my dear friend. 

Thank you!

1260,Blueopal24,1526788378,8kqcav,22,"Last year, I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I had two surgeries and 6 rounds of chemo. My boyfriend ghosted when I was diagnosed and my dog died a week after my first surgery. I was out of work almost a year in which my uncle died of bladder cancer. 2017 was an extremely rough year. 

I was lucky though because my cancer was caught early and the reoccurrence rate is less than 10%. (Stage 1C endometriod adenocarcinoma) Many are diagnosed in late stages and the survival rate is terrible. 

I meet many women with ovarian cancer through a couple of support groups and they have helped me immensely. 5 of us are in a group chat and talk almost daily.

Since the begin of this year, we lost one of the women in our group. She was only 45 and a mother. It was heartbreaking. I lost 4 other women who I have met due to ovarian cancer. 

I’m really trying to move forward with my life and get things back together. I know I’m distancing myself from the other three women in our group. The real reason is not only because I’m afraid of losing them, but I honestly can’t stand one of the woman in the group chat. I found her to be extremely narcissistic, hateful and so vain. She is constantly trying to pick fights and is always trying to top you with her stories and issues. I have also caught her in many lies. 

I usually mute the conversation on my phone because this one girl will text or message all of us at 3-4am. I have asked her repeatedly not to because I’m up at 5 am for work. She does anyway.

I feel guilty for distancing myself because I care a lot about the other women and they have been there for me. One women is stage 4 and I know her time is limited. I guess I have survivor’s guilt and it can be hard to move forward when they are still struggling with cancer.

Then my SO and I said we would take time to process all of this. Travel to a far away place. Finish what needed to be done in our house.

1277,derpflarpington,1526670186,8kfmx3,2,"Hi everyone, I just found this sub as I was searching for a place to talk about this. 

I’m on mobile, so this post seems like a long one. Apologies if it is. 

My Mom’s a very private woman and doesn’t want me sharing her condition or journey with her friends, so I figured anonymous strangers would be a better option. 

My mom found a lump near her hip back in November. She went to the doctor, who thought it was a dermatology issue and sent her away with a referral. I wish he would have performed an ultrasound himself instead of sending out the referral, as it took 2 months to get seen. 

The dermatologist also agreed that she needed an ultrasound, but as she didn’t feel it was a dermatology issue, she sent her back to her primary. 

The primary finally put in a referral for an excision biopsy, which is when they remove whatever’s in you to take a look at it. 

That was February 12th. It took about four months to get to this point. 

Two weeks later, on the 27th, we went back in for our diagnosis and pathology determined that it was a rare form of Lymphoma.

This was devastating to my mom. She just lost her brother to cancer, and of course was too emotional to know that this cancer was one of the least fatal. And before anyone says that’s the “cancer you want to have”, we know, we’d just still prefer no cancer. 

Her primary put in a referral for an oncologist, and four days later saw her neurologist on an unrelated note. 

Here’s what’s interesting. Her neurologist was part of a different network, tied to a prestigious research and cancer center in San Diego. 

She was in such bad shape by this point, both from the actual cancer and the shock associated, that her neurologist personally referred her to be seen by someone in HIS network. 

Insurance approved this, and we went down to meet the specialist, a national expert and instructor in the field. She’s wonderful and cares deeply. 

This cancer center has many benefits that I didn’t even know existed. First off, my mom was approved for a few replacements for the ABVD cocktail that would harm her body less. Second, they provide palliative care to each patient, even the ones with less fatal forms of cancer like my mom’s. 

Two weeks ago was her first chemo. She was actually fine for three days, to the point where it seemed like she’d pull through this without many symptoms. 

We made the mistake of getting a little too hopeful, and on day 5 her fever was 100.5 and she was screaming in pain, vomiting several times an hour. 

We took her to the hospital, where they put her in an isolated room. Unfortunately, this didn’t stop her from getting MRSA, and with her neutropenic fever, her condition quickly deteriorated. 

She’s been in the hospital for 5 days now, and is basically being kept in a Dilatid fueled coma. We talk maybe once a day, and she’s in a tremendous amount of pain. 

I didn’t really have any purpose in writing this other than the fact that I just needed to write it. Thanks for reading ",Mom’s Journey So Far,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8kfmx3/moms_journey_so_far/,1526691786.0,2018-05-18 14:03:06

Beannacht -- by John O’Donohue

On the day when the weight deadens on your shoulders and you stumble,
May the clay dance to balance you.

And when your eyes freeze behind the grey window and the ghost of loss gets into you,
May a flock of colours, indigo, red, green and azure blue, come to awaken in you a meadow of delight.

When the canvas frays in the currach of thought and a stain of ocean blackens beneath you,
May there come across the waters a path of yellow moonlight to bring you safely home.

May the nourishment of the earth be yours,
May the clarity of light be yours,
May the fluency of the ocean be yours,
May the protection of the ancestors be yours.

And so may a slow wind work these words of love around you,
An invisible cloak to mind your life.

1281,bros402,1526662899,8keq6i,7,"Well, three years since the diagnosis was confirmed - my local oncologist didn't feel comfortable diagnosing me with a rare leukemia, so he sent me to a guy at Columbia in NYC, who confirmed the diagnosis three years ago today. I had like a 1 PM appointment and I got there at 12:30 because i like to be early and NYC has traffic. Wasn't taken into an exam room until 3:30, and the doctor came in at 4 and said ""Okay, it is very treatable, but it is incurable. We're gonna go fine, but it is rarer than we thought!"" Then after a hour of him telling me about my cancer, his nurse walks in and says ""So, did you want a list of sperm banks?"" and I was like ""huh?"" and then she told me that chemo can result in loss of fertility, so 8 days later, I made a deposit!



Since that day 3 years ago, I stopped going to that Columbia oncologist, I went to the doctor who discovered/named the kind of cancer I have, and I started going to MSKCC in NYC (A much better fit for me!). The MSK onc had me stop chemo almost two years ago because he didn't like the side effects, and I am getting blood drawn every month and so far, so good, which is good by me!


But outside of that, cancer put my life on pause. When cancer became a possible diagnosis, I was looking for a job - I had been for a year. Couldn't teach if cancer was a possibility, could I? Especially not with a weak immune system. I figured the chemo would be a few months, maybe a year, then I would be done, because that is what the doctor said. Few visits later, he said ""oh no you're on this forever."" But back to the job stuff - I still feel like my life is on pause - when I stopped chemo, I didn't look because I didn't know if i would recur right away. I'm not looking now because some people recur around now - and it has been 4 1/2 years since I have been in a classroom to teach. I am 27 and I have no work history. How am I ever going to work?

1284,allineedisbooks,1526655220,8kdrfg,2,"Hey Everyone,

My boyfriends mother was diagnosed with Breast cancer \(Stage 2 I think\) and that means 8 weeks of chemo, then surgery, and then more chemo to follow up. He has been keeping a lot of it from me, because his mom requested that he did, so it has been hard to get information about what is going on. His mom has agreed to open up more about situation, and is in relatively good spirits, but today is her first day of chemo. My partner lives with her and plans on being her primary support. I am not allowed to come over while she goes through chemo because she doesn't want to feel like she has to make a good impression.

I have been asking my partner how to help, but he doesn't know and he didn't want to do too much research into things either. He doesn't want to get too deep into the information and freak out. I have been at a loss of what to do or say, and after a hellish week of not being to really talk to him or have his support, I started acting out at him, and was quite upset. I feel so guilty for treating him with some hostility and being upset with his distance in this situation, and also his lack of want for my help. I have apologized and told him I understand it needs to be about his mother right now, and I am here for whatever he needs.

What else can I do to be supportive, and also to not feel upset or angry at the situaiton. I think I am more frustrated because I want so badly to help him and his mom, but he has put up a wall regarding that. I am not used to being to do nothing, but wait and see. Any suggestions or advice would be great!

I was diagnosed with Stage 2 NSGT testicular cancer in August of last year. Completed chemo in December and thankfully all of my lymph nodes are clear!!

It's impossible for me to say that without mentally adding a little (...for now) after. I'm having a lot of trouble trying to get back to some level of normalcy given the rather frequent surveillance appointments I have (blood tests every two months, CT scans every 6 for the first few years)

It's like a week before every appointment I get a new ache/pain or find a new lump on my neck that I think is definitely a relapse. I get super impulsive and take a trip somewhere with little notice (which I think is burdening my SO and friends that I drop in on). The worst though is that I have difficulty setting any plans that cross or extend beyond my follow-up appointment.

I feel like I'm living 2 months at a time (but really it's 1 month and 3 weeks because I feel like I don't take a breath during the last one). Kate Bowler's recent op-ed in WaPo really struck a nerve with me (probably partially related to the fact that we sit in the same CT machine and port draw chair), the happiness of another chunk of time mixed with the fear that it could change at any moment. The difference is of course that Professor Bowler's feelings are much more founded than my own, she has non-curative stage IV colon cancer and will probably watch the tumor every 3 months until it actually does move again. I am in remission and am fixating on the slim chance negative, which even if it occurred, would still be highly curable.

If you are going through treatment or know someone who is then you are all fighters and so strong. I know sometimes you want to give up but keep on fighting! In September 2017, my mom called and said she had to go to the doctors and wanted to come over to my apartment for pizza afterwards. That day, I just had the strangest feeling, I knew something wasn’t right with her and there hasn’t been for a while. I thought to myself, ‘I think she has cancer,’ then of course I quickly fought that thought by saying, ‘no don’t ever think that.’ Well I was right. She was diagnosis with vulvar cancer and jeez things took off. When she had her first surgery my sister and I were very hopeful. We didn’t understand how bad it truly is (I still don’t think I do). The doctor came to us and said the cancer is massive and it spread to her butt so she’s going to need chemo and radiation to shrink the mass. It didn’t stop there. After that round of chemo and radiation it spread to her back and lungs. They did a more intense chemo that made her hair fall out and really took a toll on her. My mom was so brilliant. She worked as a high school English teacher and also was a college night professor. She slaved her life away by working so much. She was so excited to retire. But as soon as she retired she found out she has cancer. It’s such a shame and makes me really sad that she could never enjoy her freedom. Now my mom’s cancer spread to her hip and she needs a surgery or else her hip will fracture. My sister and my family don’t think she has much time left and I don’t either. My worst fear was losing her and it’s happened. She doesn’t understand anything anymore and if I call her with any news or anything she doesn’t understand and then whatever I was excited to share with her isn’t something I’m happy about anymore. I just don’t know what happens now. I know she’s dying but there’s no timeline set up. I wish that she could have traveled- like she wanted to when she retired- I wish she wasn’t going through this.

1313,j0rdan21,1526526423,8k0xah,4,"Hi everyone. To make a long story short, I (male, 25) was diagnosed with Primary Cutaneous Marginal Zone Lymphoma about a year ago. I received both surgical treatment to cut out the infected skin, as well as radiation therapy. I had lymphoma in both my leg and arm. I had a skin graft done on the arm, followed by radiation. The spot on the leg was small enough that it could be cut out. Fast forward to now and I have lymphoma around the scar in my leg, and possibly elsewhere (Have to schedule a biopsy). I was told that it was all removed from my leg, but now it is back. My doctor pretty much told me that there is nothing I can do. It will continuously recur and need treatment for as long as I live. In theory, as long as the disease does not become significantly more aggressive, it should never kill me. 

However, I just cannot seem to not feel like everything is going to be pointless. The more radiation I get, the more I increase my chances of getting a different cancer. On top of this, I have depression, type one diabetes, and alopecia. I am single and I don't have many friends. I don't know how I am going to afford cancer treatment along with everything else I have to pay for in the future. I feel like my life just sucks so much. I am working on getting my master's degree right now, and I some days I want to quit so badly. I never do it, because I don't want to screw myself on the slim chance that I make it. I don't know what to do. I never wanted my health to stop me from achieving my dreams, but it is so hard and I feel hopeless. Any advice/support would be greatly appreciated.

1315,lisagirl1,1526511218,8jzagd,42,"I'm 36 years old, mother to a beautiful 5-month-old baby girl, loving wife of nearly 12 years to my amazing husband and soulmate, and I've just recently been diagnosed with colon cancer that has spread everywhere. And I do mean everywhere: my brain, spine, lungs, ovaries, liver...there's nowhere it hasn't touched.  The only symptoms I had were a slightly sore back and narrower stool. There's nothing the doctors can do, and I have only weeks or days to live. 

Somehow I've been coping semi-okay...at times feeling something like a peace that passes all understanding (though also at times feeling futile anger and sometimes even hope that I'll be miraculously healed, even though I know it's not rational). I've written letters goodbye to my loved ones, made arrangements for after I'm gone, and in general feel ""okay"" about what will happen after my death (despite feeling immense and inexpressible sadness that I won't be there to watch my beautiful baby girl and my amazing nephew grow up and to take care of my husband and family. But that's not the plan for my life, so I have to accept it and move on.)

What I'm having a REALLY hard time with is how my parents and husband and sister will handle my actual dying part. I know that once I'm gone it will be terribly difficult for them (we're all such a close-knit family), but I won't be around to help them deal with that, and just have to trust that God and family and friends will see them through. What I will be around for (presumbly, if I'm not completely unconscious) is watching them deal with my actual death process. My wonderful mom was a nurse for 41 years and my mother-in-law is also a retired nurse, and they want to take care of me as I die at home with the help of hospice. My mom has seen MANY people die in her line of work, but I know that watching her own daughter go through the process will be immeasurably more difficult. And of course my darling husband will take it extremely hard too. :( 

Is there anything I can do to make this whole dying process easier on them? I've read about the things that hospice provides and the care that's required at the end-of-life, and it's terrifying. Oh how I wish I could just pass away peacefully tonight in my sleep!!! Why can't euthanasia be a legal option? I'd so much rather take it than allow my loved ones to suffer needlessly, with no hope. I'm sorry this post is so negative. I don't want my last thoughts and actions on this earth to be that way. But it's unbelievable and incredibly ironic that just five months ago my mom, mother-in-law, and husband were in the delivery room with me while I was in pain waiting for my gorgeous daughter to be born. Now they will have to watch me die, and will get no bundle of joy out of the deal--only a dead daughter and a dead wife. I just wish that I could somehow spare them this.

Up to today, I have just been at home trying to relax and recover. This morning however, I got a call from the doctor that was treating me. He called me to inform me that I needed to set up a follow-up appointment with his ASAP as he had some unfortunate news.

He told me that once they took my appendix out, they found a tumor in my appendix and it was cancerous, and that I had appendix cancer. He told me that we needed to explore my options as soon as we could and that he wanted to talk in person instead of over the phone. He didn't say how big it was, or what stage it was in, or if it had metastasized. Just that I needed to deal with it soon.

1332,Argonaught_WT,1527602961,8mzdlm,3,"Hi Guys,

I am writing the story here as I want to know just how I can help my mother beat this shit.


This whole story starts on 19 March.
I got a text saying :
""Hi just a heads up I tore the muscles in my left side over my ribs - went to see  Doctor and cos I am not able to breathe deeply have the initial stages of pneumonia. It would have been full blow by tomorrow. I am on strong meds and at home. No panic required. All in hand.""


Then about a week later, the doctor realised it was just a broken rib.


15th April, My mother starts bleeding from the uterus. 


16th April, ""Back home after scan. Huge fibroid 6cms so going to gynae on 8 May""


8th May, ""Have had all the tests and will get the results back on Tuesday. The growth could be sinister but we won't jump to conclusions till Tuesday""


15th May, Test comes back - Clear Cell Uterus Cancer. Tumor is taking up entire uterus.


18th May She goes in for a scan where she drinks the dye so we know exactly where it is.


21st May, She gets the results back - Something on her Lung, Adrenal Glands effected But nothing else. 


28th May, She goes to the oncologist (Previous tests were all done at the Gynae) with my Brother for more scans.

This is where I start getting frustrated.

1) Whilst undergoing the scan, my brother hears one oncologist tell the other ""The Adrenal Glands seem to just be a tumor, not cancer"". The other responds ""Well don't tell her"".


2) They want to do a biopsy on the thing on the lungs, and will spend 2 days in hospital to get it done (2 week waiting period).


3) Then they want her to go and get Blood Scans again (2 week waiting period) and Then Bone Scans (2 week waiting period).


4) Then they want her to undergo Chemo 6 times over the course of 18 weeks. 1 ""dose"" every 3 weeks.


5) Only after that, will they perform the Hysterectomy to remove the tumor. She is still bleeding from the uterus and will continue to do so until this stage.


All the mean time the Oncologists are saying ""This is a rapid cancer and we have to be quick"".

We are going to be getting a second opinion.
Any and all tips and tricks to help her would be great. I live about 100km away from her but have told her that the moment she needs me I will stop work and be up with her until we beat it.

Thanks for reading. Sorry if this is not the place to post it but I feel a bit helpless at this stage.

The pain was the tumor pressing against his spine, shattering it. He lost the ability to walk properly and was always in constant pain. He didn't want to hear anything about dying and truly believed he could get better. 

We went through radiation and eventually chemotherapy last Wednesday. He seemed so exhausted and slept all day. My mom found it weird so we took it to the ER and it turned out he had pneumonia with an infection in his blood. He slept the entire weekend and hardly ate.

Upon inspecting it my doctor was unsure, whether it was a Dysplastic Nevus or ""Something more grave"" (Melanoma I assume), and booked me an appointment with a dermatologist.

The appointment wait time is between 3 week to a month and I may be paranoid but the wait time is freaking me out, I have a hard time sleeping and I can't focus/get motivated at work or at home.

She is only 48, she never smoked, did drugs or made any unhealthy life choices. It is such a shock - her own mother is living with us and is in perfect health for Christ's sake. 

We talked to a bunch of various doctors, and spent a lot of time researching it online. The conclusions my family have reached are this:

1: If things continue they way they have been going thus far, my mom doesn't have long. With palliative care, doctors say she has 12-18 months left. 

2: If the ""safe"" way of doing things buys us so little time, we are going to try for the biggest risk/reward treatment we can.

We live in Canada. We aren't extremely wealthy, but with insurance we can probably afford most treatments. Since this type of cancer isn't very common here, we are likely going to try for some clinic in a different country like Germany, Israel or Japan. Currently, my mom is getting treated with radiation to hopefully stop the slight internal bleeding caused by the tumor pressing against something. After that, it's going to be chemo. It's very unlikely that either/both are going to save her, or even reduce the cancer to an size where it is small enough to surgically remove. 

We've been reading as much as we can about:

-hyperthermic treatments
-HIPEC targetted chemo
-immunotherapy

and a bunch of others that I can't even remember right now. Everyone's doing the best they can, and I figured that part of my best involves asking here. Someone who's had more than a week's time reading or experiencing this - please give me some advice. What are good treatments that are worth exploring, where are good clinics that will perform them, what clinical trials should I look into?

The last week and a half has been a complete rollercoaster. My mother-in-law, who lives in Canada (where my hubby is originally from), was diagnosed with a brain tumour last week. She was rushed into surgery as the tumour was causing significant swelling in her brain and doctors were able to remove the entire tumour, we were so relieved. Then we got the results of her CT scan, which showed a small spot on her lung. She was meant to have a PET scan to look at this more closely but due to an administrative error this has been pushed back and is now scheduled to take place this coming Wednesday.

Following the surgery, the doctors have been very positive and encouraging that this may not be advanced lung cancer, they said the brain tumour looked more like a primary cancer than a secondary and there was a chance the spot on her lung could be unrelated altogether. We were all so hopeful, but then they finished the biopsy on the brain tumour and now they're saying it looks like advanced lung cancer after all. We're sort of in limbo until the PET scan is done because that'll be the first time the doctors can investigate the spot on her lung, but we're crushed that whatever hope we had has just been dashed. 

This devastating news has been made all the harder by the fact that we're over here in England while all this is going on back in Canada, but my husband is remaining relatively stoic at present. He's refusing to let himself get emotional until we know for sure what we're dealing with. That does make sense but I worry this is going to hit him like a tonne of bricks if it does turn out to be the worst case scenario.

Does anybody have any advice how I can support him through this? I've been asking how he's feeling (which is when he told me about his plan to keep the emotions at bay until we get a proper diagnosis) and he actually seems to be handling this better than I am! But I know that I have an incredibly supportive group of friends at my office who will be there for me, but he doesn't have that, nor is he particularly comfortable with expressing emotion in that way. We've been together 20 years and I've only seen him cry twice.  All his family is back in Canada and although he's best friends with his brother, they're obviously dealing with the same thing so I don't know how comfortable he'd be sharing his fears. Many of the major updates come direct to me (his brother calls me) and I then relay them to my husband, because my hubby and his brother think they'll just cry if they hear each other's voices and won't be able to get the words out. We've already discussed him going back for a visit but he doesn't want to make any definite plans until we know what we're dealing with.

How can I support him through this? He's a typical guy in that he doesn't really like getting emotional and I fear this is going to overwhelm him, particularly since he has battled depression before. I've had a look through some advice pages online about what to say to encourage someone to open up about their feelings, but I wondered if anyone has been through this and found anything that worked particularly well or anything I should avoid doing.

I can relate to him in the way that my Mom has had cancer too, but she had cancer when I was 15 and that was a completely different set of circumstances to this.

I can't do a single thing to help beyond making her food, helping her dress etc. 

My health anxiety is so bad and I'm a wreck around any sort of illness: if a loved one so much as gets a common cold I *freak out.* It feels so suffocating. I don't know how much more I can see. I know there will be a time when she's also in a hospital bed in our living room and that could be next week or in months to come. I've seen the deterioration happen too many times and I just can't do it again but I know I have to.

I don't know what to do and I guess I would just appreciate some support. I don't know. How do I deal with it? What can I say to her? I'm normally pretty okay with emotionally supporting people but I can't emotionally support myself at the moment let alone anyone else.

Sorry this is so long and waffly. I'm not sure what I'm looking for other than support. I'm just scared of illness all the time. I'm going to go to grief counselling once my grandmother has passed which should help me come to terms with things. In the meantime I need help.

I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 14 and the disease kept coming back and now I am 26 years old. And for last 7 years the tumors are there going up and down and sometimes spreading.

I tested lots of natural remedies on myself and I like to share what I found helps me with hope it may help others with ugly cancer.

I noticed that fasting in ramadan for 16 hours without food or water gives the tumors a strong punch. But result only comes when combined with other remedies and the right diet.

Here's what I do:

After the fast I drink large cup of water with my thyroid medicine.

After a half hour I eat a large lattice salad with 2 tablespoons of onion juice.

I then eat my main meal which consists of rice or pasta and I add lots of green onions or salad with it. MEAT SHOULD NT BE EATEN MORE THEN ONCE A WEEK.

I wait a few hours then drink a 16 oz cup of Oregano tea which I make and let it sit for 24 hours so it can be really strong.

I then take 2 (00) sized gelatin capsules of curry powder that I fill myself with 8 oz cup of water.

Lastly, I take one tablespoon of dark color black seed oil. Amazing herbs is not dark enough. 

I don't eat any type of sugar foods or processed foods 

- no juice even it says 100% juice
-no honey 
-no candy of course 
-no dates even - my tumor grew really large with only three days after eating dates as seen in the below pictures.

First image is the tumor in my chest which exploded after only three days of eating dates 

The second image is 4 days after ramadan strictly doing this remedy that I made.

1400,willesuger,1527213974,8ly77a,0,"I've had cancer for a long time now. Most of my memories are connected to cancer. My life's divided into before cancer and after cancer, and I struggle to remember the before cancer part. It's tough, I've gotten by alright, but it's still tough as shit.

I was a very active kid, I loved sports and all I could think about was football. I loved to run, I loved to compete, and I was damn good at it. I was always the fastest kid.

My problems started when I was 10 years old. I was playing football with my mom, just passing the ball back and forth. Suddenly I felt immense pain, it felt like it completely surrounded me. I couldn't see, I couldn't hear, I couldn't speak; everything was black and the only thing I could feel was pain. My vision came back, hearing came back, and I found myself on the ground, clutching my foot and screaming for no apparent reason. There was no wound, I hadn't sprained my ankle or anything. No blood, no nothing, and the pain was already gone. I had never felt anything like it, and that was only the start.

This moment is when I started suffering from this terrible disease. This pain was the most pure feeling I had ever felt and it was hard to explain to anyone, I was only 10 years old and I had barely felt any pain previously, all I had was my description of it and nothing to show for it. These ""attacks"" became more and more common, more pure each time. At the same time I started experiencing another pain, it wasn't as intense but this pain was constant, it was always there and it started to completely drain me. 

I kept doing sports for as long as I could, I still loved it. It hurt like hell, but I tried to get through and I hoped that the pain would just go away. I told my family, I told my friends, I told my teachers and my coaches, but it was hard for them to grasp just how intense the pain was. I was the fastest kid at school; like it wouldn't be possible for me to be in that much pain. Growing pains, flat feet, ""it's common for young boys who do a lot of sports to experience pain in their feet"" is what I got from doctors. And when the doctors told me there was nothing wrong with me, I again had nothing to show to my friends and instead I was met by disbelief. The disbelief led to me not even believing in myself, was the pain a figment of my imagination? Was I getting worse at sports and just looking for an excuse? I started doubting myself and I wasn't sure of anything anymore.

The pain got worse each year. The attacks grew more frequent. I lost my ability to run. I quit all of the sports I participated in. When I was 14 I could barely walk and I would skip school just so that I wouldn't have to get up on my feet. I started lying to everyone around me, they asked me how I was doing and I was always doing great. No pain, so that I wouldn't be called a liar. Never tired, so that nobody would know I stopped sleeping. I walked as straight as I could to hide how painful each step was.

A couple of months before my 15th birthday a doctor finally found something wrong with me. A tumor the size of a tennis ball was located in my right foot. I was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma which is a rare form of cancer. Based on the size, location and what the tissue looked like, it was estimated that it had been growing for around 5 years. I was diagnosed with cancer, and it was one of the happiest days of my life, or so I thought. I had been called a liar for so long that even I thought that I was lying. I had been hiding my symtoms for so long and I had been telling myself that I was alright, but now I was finally free. I had an explanation and everyone would finally understand my pain and my suffering.

But the day that people understand what I've gone through would never come. It only brought on more confusion. Now I had an explanation, I had a reason for my behaviour, and I was cured after the treatment, right? But they don't understand the pain, they don't understand the suffering. They don't understand what it feels like to vomit every day for a year, they don't understand what it feels like to lose 25% of their body weight because of it. They don't understand what it feels like to be unable to eat because of blisters that completely fill up their mouths. They don't understand what it's like to be afraid of eating, because eating leads to shitting and they don't understand what it's like to be afraid of shitting because all you fucking shit is blood because of the blisters. They don't understand what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night screaming because of cramps throughout their entire bodies, enveloping them in pain. They don't understand what it's like to spend every moment in constant pain, and they don't understand what it's like to spend 12 years that way. They don't understand, and how would they. 

My leg and my foot was completely broken and I'd never be able to walk a day in my life again without pain. My shoe sizes differed by 2-3 sizes. My legs differed by 3-4cm. My foot was as stiff as a brick, every step was like walking on broken glass. Pain killers didn't help. Is it really that weird that I turned to alcohol? I don't think so. I spent the following 7 years in agony, always waiting for the weekend so that I could get completely pissed out of my mind. Trying to forget all of the memories, trying to get rid of the pain. 

It never worked. I was broken and I had nowhere to turn to. Nobody understood, nobody got what I went through. Nobody understood that I was still going through it. The 5 years when nobody believed me. The year of treatment. The following 7 years, nobody understood a small part of even one of the time periods. 

My cancer came back christmas 2017. The tumor was located at the same place as the last tumor. My leg was amputated within a week, and this day WAS the happiest day of my life. 5 months since the amputation. I feel more confident, more like myself and I feel stronger every day. I use a prosthetic leg and I walk straighter and with less pain than I can ever remember. For the first time in 12 years I've started to experience entire days without pain. I can walk further than before. I can run again. An active life is possible. 

People will never understand, and I'm not trying to fault them for that and I'm trying to come to terms with it, but atleast now people get it to a certain extent. They look at me and they see my leg and they know that I've seen some shit. I never showed my pain before, and I still don't show it, but they know that I've seen some terrible terrible shit. I've never wanted attention or felt the need for sympathy, all I've ever wanted is to be acknowledged, and I finally feel like I am. I've spent the past 5 months working out, trying to eat healthier and generally just trying to cope with everything I've gone through. It's like I've been living in a fog for the past 12 years and it's only just now finally starting to clear up. My life was put on hold when I was 10 years old, but I'm ready, now more than ever, to start living again. It feels like I'm on holiday, and it took the removal of my leg for me to feel this way.

I've posted my story here before, I just find it comforting to put all of these words here. This is probably the wall of texts of all wall of texts so if you got through all the way to the finish then thank you for reading!

After my father passed from bladder cancer in November 2014, I decided to stick around this sub and offer those seeking advice on bladder cancer, my knowledge.

Today though, I learned that my mother has breast cancer.  I'll be 32 this year.  There is a chance this was caught early.  Based on the biopsy by the radiologist, my mother has invasive ductal carcinoma.  We won't know the official stage or grade until the oncology surgeon performs his own biopsy.  We're meeting with him for a consultation tomorrow.  

What we currently know is that this cancerous mass was almost mistaken for a calcification, it was small like pea.  No other lumps, tumors, or growths have popped up on the scan.  The surgeon will decide if she does an MRI before or after the lumpectomy biopsy he'll perform.  

So just based on the scans, despite the fact it's labelled invasive, the cancer seems to be in a localized region of the breast.

My oncologist wanted to hit me with super strong chemo and my reproductive system died a pretty terrible death, apparently. I have dozens of these hot flashes every day. My doctors have tried every remedy they can think of, with no relief! I can't have hormones, of course. It's such a drag in the summertime, especially when things get humid. The other day, I just gave up and buzzed my head again. I keep trying to grow my hair out, now that it finally came back, and sadly I just can't have it on my head. The hot flashes get too bad.

It's so hard sometimes to ""move on"" from cancer, because seriously I am 1000% DONE with talking and thinking about cancer and being in the ""sick space"", when your body won't stop reminding you.",Just gotta rant...

1409,loveagreatmystery,1527172401,8lt3n0,4,"Hi, I am new to this community but unfortunately not new to skin cancer (melanoma, basal cell and infiltrating basal cell). After multiple Moh's and excisions my doctor has recommended I start topical chemo on my face. 

I am game to try the topical chemo, but the idea of smearing vaseline around my eyes (to protect them) kind of skeeves me out, and also I wear contact lenses and they do not play well with anything greasy. So my question is: has anyone else gone through this, and did you find out any tips or tricks for protecting your eyes other than Vaseline?

Thank you! Best wishes to everyone here and their loved ones who are dealing with cancer. ",Has Anyone Else Used Topical Chemo Cream?,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8lt3n0/has_anyone_else_used_topical_chemo_cream/,1527194001.0,2018-05-24 09:33:21

1419,CFODad,1527129768,8lpa8j,8,"At the risk of sounding stupid (I feel stupid) I implore you to get a will for you and your spouse. 

My wife died without one. We assumed being in a community property state meant everything just passed to me. Wrong.

We are and were educated people, just not in the law. 

In Texas, and probably other community property states, when a spouse dies intestate (without a will), half the estate goes to the spouse and half goes to ALL the children, those from the marriage, those from before the marriage, and THOSE CHILDREN THAT WERE ADOPTED OUT.

If all these people in my life weren’t awesome people, I could have had to sell my business and possibly my home. They all felt this was not equitable and have agreed to gift it all back to me (that’s the way it works).

The estate still must go through probate. Minimum $3,500  for attorney and weeks to finish at least. They shut down all my bank accounts today when they found out she passed. Fixed that but scary and time consuming. With a will they just do what the will says to do.

TL:DR Get a will even if in a community property state.",Get a Will,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8lpa8j/get_a_will/,1527151368.0,2018-05-23 21:42:48

So here's the story :

One day I notice a small bump in my mouth 

Went to the ENT and i had a biopsy done 16 days ago

I got the result today but i didn't understand anything !! he just tell me to come in 6 month for a control ...

I manage to get the conclusion : :

The histological examination revealed a squamous mucosa, whose epithelial reverence was focally ulcerated and replaced by a fibrin-leucocyte coating. On the banks of this ulceration, the epithelium is the seat of a discrete cyto-architectural disorganization with mild to moderate atypia prevailing at the level of the basal layer. The under-height chorion is the secret of a discreet inflammatory infiltrate PAS staining does not show pathogen

Conclusion:

Mucus ulceration with mild to moderate atypia whose regenerative or dysplastic character is difficult to assert Monitoring is necessary

I just have few questions :

Its a dysplasia or a benign tumor ? 
Do I will get cancer in the long run ? 
What's the cause of this ?
