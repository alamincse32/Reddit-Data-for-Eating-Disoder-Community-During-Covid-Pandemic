Trying to eat a recommended calorie intake is stressing me out. 

People are saying ""just eat when you're hungry"" but I'm NEVER hungry. I'm constantly full, and then it's time to eat again. 

I have to track the calories or I will eat half or less of what my maintenance is, let alone any gain. The thought of the amount I need to eat for the day is genuinely stressing me out and feels time consuming.

 I keep going to the gym trying to build muscle but if I see the scale fluctuate at all I panic. It's impossible for me to register as a positive. 

I feel like losing weight was giving me control of my life and now I feel lost and spiraled without it. What the hell am I supposed to do. I feel like I look ""okay"" in a mirror, but I feel fat and disgusting if I see myself without one.

Is there advice anyone has? Anything? I'm desperate. 

Losing weight kept my depression and anxiety in check. Without that now I feel really, really lost.

I can't believe this has happened, I was so excited to get to maintenance and enjoy all these foods. But now that I'm here I cant stomach anything.",Request: I feel lost and no one understands it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ff032l/request_i_feel_lost_and_no_one_understands_it/,1583630895,07-03-20 13:28

3,EDPostRequests,1583515876,fegw0g,"So I’ve struggled on both ends of the spectrum with disordered eating. From age 11-19 I went through periods of restrictive eating, I was good for about 3 years, and then when I was 23 I started binging periodically, and am still trying to get a handle on that 3 years late. BUT I’m not a restrictive eater anymore.

My boyfriend started a fitness journey about a year ago, and has really started to see some muscle gains. Only now he’s obsessing over it. He flexes in the mirror constantly, and is always coming up to me and getting me to feel all his muscles. I know he is proud of himself, and it’s exciting to see positive changes in his body, but it makes a part of me feel lousy. I try to go to the gym, and he gets so excited and encouraging and proud when I go, but will kind of give me a disappointed shrug when I tell him that I didn’t go and tells me I need to push myself to go even when I don’t feel like it. I know he is just trying to motivate me, but it just sorta feels extreme and it feels like I have someone telling me I’m not good enough (when I know that’s not what his intention or thought process is... it’s my own issue).

He has become a slave to myfitnesspal and obsesses over his macros. The thing is, he doesn’t even truly know the benefits of each macronutrient. He has never done research, he just thinks protein = good, and carbs and fat = bad. Watching him read labels constantly is annoying, and makes me feel self conscious when I went to enjoy a treat that he has deemed as “bad”. I’ve tried explaining to him that there really aren’t good vs. bad foods, and that some treats are okay in moderation, yadda yadda, and he just brushes me off and says that that’s a good mindset for me, but it doesn’t work for him and that discipline has been important in his fitness journey, and that he’s never held himself accountable like this for so long.

Today really got to me though. Every Saturday his work orders those party pizzas. He hasn’t had any pizza for a month because he was doing “no dairy February”. I also tried to do it with him, but the restriction was really hard on me and always checking labels for dairy was too obsessive for me to feel okay about it. Today he asks if we were gonna be eating out tonight (it’s a friends birthday and we’re going to clubs), so I said probably because we’re going to be out partying and will probably get drunk food at 3am. He said he really wanted one little square of pizza (you know how party pizzas are just the little squares) but that he didn’t want to if we were going to be eating out later. These squares are SMALL and the caloric value isn’t high. I told him to just have one square as a treat and then eat the lunch he brought. He said “but if I have one square then I will relapse” ....

Relapse on what???

I don’t know if he just isn’t aware of what relapsing really means, or if he sees pizza as that bad that having one tiny square of it will set him back completely. I know that I’m a bit of a hypocrite because I’m still struggling with finding a healthy balance in my eating, but I worked SO hard to put the restrictive habits behind me, and specifically to accept that eating things like pizza once in a while isn’t bad for me (on the contrary I may have taken that a little too far lol but anywayyyy).

I told him how his comment made me feel (triggered), and he said that it was just a joke because he knows he can control himself, he just can’t decide whether he wants to control, or indulge.

To me, indulging does not mean one little square of pizza. So now I am just concerned that even though he brushed the relapse comment off as a “joke”... he still thinks that having one slice is indulging. This used to be his lunch every Saturday, and he would easily eat like 8 of these squares (which for reference = 3 regular slices of pizza).

My perception of food is still kind of skewed and sometimes I can’t tell what is truly okay or not. I’m being triggered by the way he is talking about this pizza, but I can’t tell if I’m the problem or if he might have a problem.

I’m restricting worse than I ever have, but my weight is still okay. Because it was critically low last year and I “snapped out of it” without professional help I’ve been dealing with feelings of not being sick enough, but I know better so I’m trying to push past that.

I’m just not really sure where to go from here. I confessed to my therapist but she didn’t have anything to suggest besides “can you at least eat like xxx calories” and maybe try overeaters anonymous even though my problems are all restrictive. So I probably need a new therapist (and have for awhile) but I’m overwhelmed by the idea of “breaking up” with this one that I’ve been seeing for a few years. Do I look for an ED therapist? Do I go to my primary and confess to her?

I don’t even know what voluntary recovery-seeking looks like when you don’t need to go inpatient and refeed and whatnot.

6,EDPostRequests,1583515389,fegrit,"Recently went for bloodwork and the results are troubling.

I have ARFID (a food avoidance disorder) that as plagued me since birth. It’s been a chronic thing for me.

I’ve attended eating therapy, been to doctors, etc, but nothing has done anything for me. Yes, I know I need to put effort in to, I’m just saying when I attended, it did not help.

Because of recent concerns, I was issued a heavy bloodwork test which checked almost every area.

As the results filter in, I see a huge problem.

I am vitamin and iron deficient (very expected) causing anemia and I am now taking supplements for that.

The biggest problem is that I am pre-diabetic at only 15 years old.

To solve this problem, most people just adjust their diet and use alternatives in recipes (a flour I can’t remember, fake sugar, etc.). However, with my ed, this is way harder. I have an over sensitive palate and can taste most changes in food and it’s very possible I will end up cutting anything that tastes different out of my already incredibly limited diet. You’re also supposed to stop consuming any sugar and cut back on almost all carbs. And, well, basically all of my diet is carbs with some added sugar.

I have been in recovery for quite some time, and everything goes better . There are questions I wanna ask to you guys, anyway:

√did you sweat a lot while sleeping in the early stages of recovery? I never ever sweat, even in the gym nor in summer, but I lately started waking up wet. Super weird for me.

√do you get ""mad"" when you eat a very bad meal? It happened to me and my bf to try a pizza place and it was horrible. I felt in a super bad mood after it, I didn't even want to finish it. I felt like ""such a waste of good food time I could have had instead of eating this crap"".

√sugar craving? I have never had a sweet tooth but Jesus lately I have been indulging in cooking more sweets for me and my bf ahaha associated with period it's the worst lol

√does an Ed recovery subbredit exists? I would love to join it 😻

13,EDPostRequests,1583394738,fdrzif,"A few years ago, I decided to lose some weight and started to track everything I ate, keeping below a strict (and not healthy) calorie limit. Then, I went the other extreme and ate so so much food in the evenings (after trying to restrict earlier in the day). I then went back to restricting, much more intensely with a much lower calorie limit. I also started to feel a lot worse about my body and would try to go a really long time without eating. I was just generally really miserable during this time period.

But I’m a lot better now. I fluctuate between being okay with eating (but just thinking a lot about it), and being pretty upset with myself if and while I eat certain foods. I guess I still try to subconsciously keep below a certain limit, but I try not to think too much about it.

So now I’m wondering, do I have an eating disorder right now? I know people can’t really diagnose me, and this probably isn’t even enough information, but I guess I just wanted some outside input. I recognize that eating disorders sometimes arise when you start to feel like you’re losing control over certain things in life, and this whole thing started when I came to college, and I kind of lost myself in my studies and felt that I didn’t have as great of a handle on things as I did in high school.

I’m considering talking to a therapist/psychiatrist, but I also think I’m just really overplaying this situation, especially since I’m in a much better mental state than I was in last year. It’s still not close to ideal though since I’m almost always thinking about food. Any thoughts would be nice, thanks in advance.

i was in a treatment centre for anorexia from the age of 12 to about 15. i convinced the treatment centre i was at i was better and didn't need any more therapy. i was 100% lying, but i hated the centre so much and i had panic attacks every time i had to go.

over the next couple years, i still struggled a lot with my body image but i became weight-restored. my family and friends all stopped worrying about me, i even went through a stint in grade 11 where i gained a lot of weight. i was horrified when i went to the doctor and saw the number and lost the weight through calorie counting and exercising a lot.

the thing is throughout this whole time, i still felt very similarly to how i felt when i was younger and struggling. in terms of body-image, guilt, restrictive patterns, etc.

i am now 20, and this past year was a tough one. i was eating in an extreme deficit, back on my ed twitter account, taking constant bodycheck photos, etc. i lost weight and the people in my life noticed. but i felt like a fraud, like even though i was doing restrictive behaviours i felt like my illness wasnt valid and i was just going through a phase or something.

i am trying to take care of myself now and not over-restrict to lose weight. but it's very hard for me to not slip into my old ways of restriction. 

i guess i am  confused about what recovery means. when you are fully and legitmately recovered, do you never get these feelings again? does my relapse mean that i was never recovered in the first place? i wish i could understand these feelings, i am so frustrated at hating my body and myself so much that this is how i treat myself.

i thought i had already been eating for recovery for like six months, but after my last doctors visit where my mom told me i supposedly had lost two pounds, i decided to try harder. i’ve been fitting extra snacks in where i can and started using oils to sauté food (big fear). the only problem is i’ve just NOW started to see the effects and i don’t like it. i can see that i’m getting chubby. i don’t know why but this part is insanely triggering for me. back when i was underweight i used to feel bad about my body; i didn’t like how i didn’t even fit into my old size at target and it made me feel horrible. at that point i knew i needed to gain weight. but now that it’s actually happening i’m seriously freaking out. every time i finish eating i wish i could go throw up but i don’t have the energy to. there are still places like my arms and my upper chest that are ugly and honey, but all of the weight is going to my thighs. nobody in school ever commented on my weight but i still liked seeing that i was skinnier than them. it seems like since i was able to start eating more, slowly giving up on my fear foods, that i’m not sick anymore, like i was never sick. it’s like i need the label “i have an eating disorder.” i don’t know why because i hate making it seem like i’m begging for attention but at the same time it’s exactly what i’m doing. i want people to look at me and be scared for me. but they’re not going to do that when i’m eating and at a healthy weight. i know how this fucked up this sounds, im sorry. i guess what i’m asking is, how do i stay motivated when i feel so close to giving up? how do i keep going when in the back of my mind i know that i’m just voluntarily making myself bigger?",Request: Handllng weight gain in recovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fcstye/request_handllng_weight_gain_in_recovery/,1583254004,03-03-20 4:46

I posted previously with a concern that my sister (very sporty, runner etc) was losing weight and I had noticed this and was concerned she may be developing some disordered eating habits. The responses were mainly saying that I was being hyper aware and overly obsessed with regards to eating habits (understandably) when in fact it could simply be a healthy weight loss. I accepted this may well be true and tried to ignore my concerns. 

Fast forward another few months and my sister admits to struggling with eating via text to myself(and asks for help from me!) and she is now clearly underweight and starting to look ill.

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for a year now, and with the new coronavirus going around I’d like to ask a question in relation to immune systems. I’m not too clued on this, and I like to be optimistic, however I’ve been freaking out about her lately due to the coronavirus and worrying about her catching it. 

If anyone wouldn’t mind, could someone shed some light on the effects of anorexia and immune systems?

So I guess I’m curious to know how worried I should be about this situation, like is it possible that her immune system isn’t too bad seeing as she’s been on a meal plan and hasn’t been drastically underweight since the beginning etc? Not sure if this means anything either, but she doesn’t necessarily get sick anymore, in terms of colds/flu etc. Anyway, I’m sorry if the wording was a little bit jumbled up, but I hope you understand!

I have been bulimic for around one year now. Along with terrible body dysmorphic issues, i’ve become obsessed with exercise and planning meals.

38,EDPostRequests,1584050865,fhomqy,"I hope this is not triggering, I'm not used to eating disorders and it took me a while to find the courage to type this out.

To explain my situation a bit: Im 18, male and have always been a little underweight. Being skinny felt like the only thing that made me likeable.
I started to eat healthy and exercised a lot by the time I turned 16 because I wanted to lose weight and then gain muscle mass. I felt confident for the first time and was really productive and at a good place mentally back then. I stopped by the time I was underweight and had gained some muscle mass as well. I continued with eating healthy, exercised a lot and didn't gain the weight back. I know that people with disorders lose control but I still had control over it all so I didn't think it was a problem.
I am now 18 and have not been feeling comfortable in my body and I am struggling with school right now. I started to exercise again because I have gained in the wrong places and exercise has always helped me when my mental health was declining. I weighed myself today and I have lost a lot of weight even though I always eat a lot and I don't look any different than before. Nobody else has noticed so I guess I'm all good, as long as I don't look like I'm dying. I'm aware that there are a few red flags here but it sounds worse than it actually is as I'm not experiencing any health issues and am not addicted to weight loss. I know that it is a coping mechanism but I can go without losing and I can go back to eating normal if I need to.

Here's the issue tho: I have never learned how portion sizes work and I think that's why I have started to be conscious of what I eat in the first place. I never know how much food is appropriate and I always eat everything on my plate (I don't even know why) so I always fear that I'm overeating. Once my metabolism slows down when I'm older, I will gain if I still eat as much as I used to. So I tried to teach myself how much food is okay/normal to eat.
I know that you can learn about that stuff in recovery so I was wondering if you have any advice? I really don't want to gain but I think that if I continue to lose weight I will have to go to the hospital and I don't want them to think I have a disorder. Especially if they force me to eat. I also don't want them to make me heavier than I have ever been because even my normal weight has always been a little low.

I think this will fix itself once I learn how to eat properly. I don't trust my judgement on what is too much tbh. I don't want to measure (I used to count calories as good as I could without measuring, I counted my steps and monitored my weight as well) because that's disordered behaviour and I don't want to slip into anything. 
I'm generally really bad with estimating stuff, not just food but also spaces (?). There have been a few incidents in the past where I attempted to make my friends move in order to e.g. sit next to them on a bench and they always look at me weird and when I sit down I notice that they didn't have to move in the first place. It's been happening a lot lately and I think that one of my friends (we aren't close) is watching me even though you can't see my weight loss. I'm getting really self-concious if anybody watches me eat and I feel like I have to eat a lot in front of her so she stops monitoring me.

That's all I guess, thanks for reading. I mostly need advice on how to estimate how much food I need because that's probably the root of my problem. And I guess I kinda needed to vent. Idk, maybe I just want to hear that I shouldn't worry about my friend and everything.

When she was working, she would go to the gym every morning for around an hour/hour and a half. We would have dinner together every night as a family. 

Overall, her relationship with food was not presenting a problem, however it was still a very controlling and neurotic relationship. Now that she has retired, this relationship has been pushed to the extreme. She has completely cut out carbs, rarely eats dinner, and has told me multiple times that she eats far below a healthy number of calories

. She does 2 hours of cardio every day. She has always been a thin woman, but now it has gone too far. Her face is gaunt, her legs are all bones. She has issues with bone density as it is and has broken at least 2 bones in the last year. I am so worried about her. 

She has my dad, but he's pretty oblivious to most things and hasn't done anything to indicate that he recognizes this problem. I feel like a horrible daughter for not picking up on this sooner or realizing that this problem could escalate from what it used to be. 

I think she thinks in retirement now she has to stay fit and active (which is great!), because her parents and siblings have all kind of let themselves go as they've aged and she has said that she always wants to be able to be active and independent as she ages. But this is not the way to do it. She has little muscle mass to be able to do anything. I'm so worried about her. How do I even bring up this subject to her? 
She is a stubborn 56 year old woman who is very stuck in her ways. This situation is even more complicated by the fact that I have been very overweight my whole life and within the last year have worked on being healthier and have been able to lose a substantial amount of weight myself. I am sure that only exasperates this issue. 
I know moving forward I need to completely stop weightloss/body image talk around her. It's going to be hard because I know she is excited and proud of me and wants to talk about it. Which is part of the problem.

I feel calm and rested so I'm usually taken aback when the alarm goes off.

The times this occurs are almost always before/during/after meals. It seems to start when I'm planning to eat (e.g. walking into the dining commons), continue as I eat, and go on for up to an hour after my meal. It also appears to happen whether I've waited til I'm ravenous or I eat when I just start feeling hungry. I do suspect it's underlying anxiety and its correlation with meal times is significant. I don't know if it's blood sugar-related, but it'd be odd that it continues consistently for so long and isn't affected by how long I've gone without eating.

I have no underlying medical conditions, and I'm perfectly healthy as of my January physical. I spent a few days de-stressing and cutting out anxiety triggers, but I'm still experiencing it around meals only, not even when I'm worked up/stressed/anxious about other things, so I don't think it's generalized anxiety, though I am diagnosed with GAD.

I'm a 37 female and I've been in recovery for over 13 years now. I started restricting when I was 12 years and didn't fully into a recovered state until I was 22/23 and decided to go back to college full-time. I will say I was very good at my eating disorder that I was inpatient 9 times in 7 different centers with a feeding tube twice. If I can get better - so can you.

Some things that helped me in recovery: 

1. Getting out of my old ED environment. This meant moving out of my mom's house into the dorms and making new friends.

2. Social Interaction - I could not do my behaviors if I was isolating. So I ate with friends and even just out in public as much as possible.

3. Having a goal outside of my ED. I went back to college so I had classes and projects to focus on rather than meals and numbers.

4. STAYING ON MY MEAL PLAN. I did this for the first few years. Whatever I had to do to get it in - I did it. It sucked. I did not like it for awhile then it was just normal and my anxiety became less and less. I can say my anxiety around food is zero now.

5. Giving myself GRACE. This does not go away over night. It will suck some days. Some days will feel like a gift. Your body will change but that is what it takes for your mind to change!

I hope this helps someone whether its a loved one or a person struggling. Please talk to people in your life about what is going on.

However, her grandmother recently passed away unexpectedly she was her biggest supporter throughout the whole process (I only met her when she was in remission) and now my gf tells me that her death is not only making everything harder in general but also making her remission harder.

 She says that she feels worse about her body now than ever and I just want to be there to love and support her but I’m not sure how to take the place of her grandmother as she knew everything about how to support people with EDs bc she went to classes on it and everything.

 I would just really appreciate it if people had any suggestions on things that worked for them or what they wish people had done/said to help them (I’ve asked her what I should do to support her and she said she doesn’t really know as she never really got support from anyone except her grandmother  (her parents don’t really as they always say stuff like “just eat” and I know it’s not as easy as that and that that’s hurtful to her recovery)). 

I know the basics of what to say and what not to say as I’m studying to be a clinical psychologist, but EDs are far from what my specialty is, but I’m not completely in the dark. Like I said before, all I want is to love and support her and help her feel good about herself again bc that’s what she deserves. I’m open to hearing any suggestions and if I think that it even has a slight chance of working for her, I’ll give it a shot.

44,EDPostRequests,1584021755,fhgsnm,"I first made this post in a relationship subreddit asking about my boyfriends unusual eating habits. I never recognised that he may have a disorder until someone commented that so I'm looking for other opinions. 

We have been together 5 months, he is 25. This has been going on the entire time.

My boyfriend is quite weird with food, I don't know what to make of it as I've never encountered something like this before.

He doesn't eat the majority of food, because they're ""unhealthy"", ""bad"" or would cause him to ""go back to his old ways"".

He is very slim and lean, he hates having body fat and a lot of his eating seems to be focused on making sure his bf % is as low as possible. However, he used to be overweight. I don't know how big he was as he has deleted all old pictures and doesn't like talking about it, but I know it made him very self conscious and he has said before that he was ""disgusting"". He gets weirdly annoyed and upset when anyone even mentions the fact that he used to be bigger. I don't think people treated him well when he was fat. 

I'll try my best to explain all his weird  routines but I will probably forget stuff. 

He is vegan and doesn't eat carbs, except on saturdays when he allows one small portion. He spends ages planning out his ""carb meal"" of the week. He weighs EVERYTHING and puts the calorie count in myfitnesspal. Obviously low carb vegan is super restrictive anyway, but he takes it even further to the point where the majority of his diet is just beans and vegetables.

Before every meal he drinks a cup of water and a cup of green tea. Before every evening meal he will also eat a bowl of plain boiled vegetables, usually broccoli or cabbage or something. I don't know why he does this, I asked him and he just said ""habit"" like okay... another thing he does is cuts everything into super tiny pieces and eats realllyyyyy slowly. In the last few days I realised he does this to suppress his appetite so he eats less. 

One time I cooked for us and he was okay with it until I showed him the box of the vegan meat we were using. It was very high in fat and he realised it had put him over his calorie allowance for the day and got really weird and upset about it, and talked about ""spiralling"". He exercised more and ate less the next day to make up for it.

We have only been out to eat together once. The only thing he could eat on the menu was a salad. He *picked out the breadcrumbs*. Like he sat there and picked out every tiny crumb before he ate a single bite. He's aware that his eating habits are weird because he said ""don't judge me"" before he did it...but I was just like ???. I'm not sure why he is so afraid of eating bread, even tiny amounts. It's like a phobia or something. 

He often says that he ""hates eating"" and wishes he didn't need to do it. I said something like ""maybe you need to eat some nicer food"" and he said something about how food is only fuel to him and eating nice food is self indulgent and unnecessary.

Is this concerning or is it normal for thin people that used to be bigger? 
He is very slim and has hardly any body fat. He has that ""paper thin skin"" look and you can see all his veins and muscles. He always has extremely cut abs. I don't think his bmi is underweight though, probably low end of healthy. He carefully tracks his body fat to make sure it is always under 8%, but he says that he is happier when it is around 5%. I think he looks a little bit gaunt and unwell sometimes, but I could be biased. He is clearly very fit as he is able to run long distances and works out every day.

I spoke to him once seriously about it, and he just said ""as long as I'm healthy, I should be able to eat what I want"" which I agree with, so I'm not really sure what I can say.

It just bothers me a bit. I wish he could be a bit more free with food and enjoy things without beating himself up about it. It's clear that eating causes him anxiety on some level, he admitted to that, but he said it's better that than be obese again.

Should I speak to him or is it none of my business? Is this an eating disorder?


Tldr; not sure if I should speak to my boyfriend about his eating habits. He doesn't allow himself to eat the vast majority of food and has weird rituals around eating. He used to be overweight and i think the anxiety is kind of focused on that. I'm concerned he may have am eating disorder.

So I have always been underweight because I have a fast metabolism and lose weight rather easily. I have kinda lost my appetite recently because of stress and because I'm not doing well mentally and have lost some weight due to that. Currently I am eating enough to not gain it back. I do not actively try to lose weight tho.
I am quite active and recently started eating cleaner again. I don't like a lot of foods, especially greasy stuff because my stomach hurts after I eat it. I do skip meals sometimes because of school but I am not even that underweight so I never thought it was a problem. I don't even weight myself and don't monitor my eating. I am always hungry but I think that is when I am bored or stressed so it's useless to eat then as my body doesn't need it but is just acting up.

I have been feeling dizzy lately, similar to when you smoke for the first time in weeks, but it usually passes after some time and I think it is anxiety or stress. I nearly passed out in the shower tho and my mum dragged me to the ER because of that. I also had stomach pains and couldn't stand up and my heart is all weird (that's probably all anxiety tho). 
Anyways, the doctor and nurse have been concerned because of my sh scars (my family doesn't know about that). They weighed me (my bmi is not that low) and took a look at my blood work and checked my organs and stuff. 
The doctor said I should come to her if I need to talk but I guess that's kinda standard for someone who cuts. She did give me resources for therapy and there was one about eating disorders.

Hello, my name is Ethan and I am a trans man. I am here, today, asking for advice. Since I was about 11, I have been eating less and less over the years. (Age 11 also signifies the beginning of secondary school, a big change in situation for me) I started skipping meals, or challenging myself to see how long I could go without eating before I felt sick. I would put other people before myself, at school anyway, and skip breakfast and lunch, and eat maybe just pasta for dinner at home. Then, the summer would either make it worse by eating less, or make it “better” by eating more. Then, the cycle would continue again when school started. 

It’s been four years since then, and I’m only know realizing it isn’t normal to skip meals every day. However, this year marked the start of me counting calories, knowing exactly what I put into every meal, weighing everything I used in a meal, writing down how many calories I was eating, refusing to eat high calorie foods. 
This, coupled with the fact I had recently started wearing my fitbit watch again (which told me how many calories I was burning), made me feel worse and worse about eating. 

I set a limit for myself, at very low calories per day. This was at September, and since school shut down a couple weeks ago, the number has lowered to even lower. In addition, I started exercising a lot more than before. I wanted to lose weight, so what I was doing was healthy? It would’ve been I guess, had i actually ate something that day. 

Furthermore, ever since I was a child, I was obsessed with my weight. Now, I couldn’t really ever actually weigh myself, our scale for people broke back when I was five and we never bought a new one. But, I would stare at myself in the mirror and feel depressed as I looked at the fat around my stomach, and this got worse at puberty (coupled with gender dysphoria) as I gained even more weight. That ties in with the beginning of skipping meals at age 11 (puberty began at 10). 

And now, even though I’ve barely eaten anything and have grown at maximum about three inches since I was 11, I still have that weight, visibly. (Though, since August I had lost some weight) It made me feel bad, and I felt like shit whenever I ate in front of people. My s/o keeps trying to help me get over this, saying that he loves me for who I am, and how I look. But it’s just, difficult.

As of late, I’ve been trying to eat more. But I can’t, I struggle every time I try to eat more than one and a half meals a day, and then I barely eat the next day because I “don’t feel hungry”.

But everyday it is a struggle mentally. If I eat my total calories, I hate myself, feel shame and weak for not having been able to keep it lower. If I keep it lower, I give into some more food to satisfy my hunger. The people around me seem to have smaller appetites than me and are able to eat less, while still wanting less naturally. 
Although I tell my closest friends and boyfriend about my insecurities, I never let them know how mentally terrible and hard it is. They wouldn't get it anyways, because to them it seems like I eat normally and more, like when I get ice cream after lunch or buy something at my school snack bar.

For the past couple of months, she's been doing extremely well - she was eating well, feeling good, and she had just entered therapy a few weeks ago. However, since the Corona virus kicked in, therapy has stopped, and she's been on her own ever since. For the past week, she's spent most of her time at my place, but yesterday something seemed off. She told me she needed time apart, and that her head was flowing over with all kinds of thoughts and feelings. I'm scared she's suffering, and I want to help, however she has completely closed herself off from me and asked me to respect that - which I do. She's currently home, and she says she is struggling with her own feelings. I feel like I have to do something, but I can't, as she explicitly asked me to stay away...

62,EDPostRequests,1584560625,fkvr85,"So, I guess I’m wondering if I have an eating disorder or not. I’m very uneducated on this topic, so I’m coming in peace strictly for advice/education and really hoping that I don’t offend anyone if this isn’t one and feels belittling to your actual struggles. 

About a year ago I had shoulder surgery and during the recovery my daily mental health issues (depression and anxiety. In treatment but nothing super serious) began to increase for this and also because my dad was was going through significant health issues (happy news, he is now way better). Also, I’m typically a very active person but was holed up due to the surgery. 

I began eating less and less during this period. I attributed it due to the lack of calories I was burning and my body adjusting to a new routine. But I have been back to my normal routine for 3-4 months now, and I’m still eating very very little. There are times when I eat 3 full and healthy meals for 3 days straight, but more often, nI have 1 meal in 2 days. I’ve never vomited after eating, I’ve very rarely eaten until uncomfortably full (thanksgiving only), and I don’t want to lose weight-if I’m being honest I’d like to gain about some pounds. But I will often skip breakfast, struggle through a few bits at lunch and then eat a tiny dinner. This while working an active job that I am out and about for 8 hours a day.

The thing is that I want to eat and know I have to eat, but often, no matter how hungry I am or how good the food looks, it just makes me start to gag. And it’s a struggle to get through every bite, so I often just end up not eating. I even often feel lightheaded throughout the day, but just can’t force my body to eat. 

I guess my question is, does this sound like anything you guys have every heard of? I kind of just made this realization, I knew something weird was going on for a while but only recently truly came to terms with it. I tried googling but nothing really fit what I’m going through. 

Typically I would go to a doctor but I don’t want to take up anyone’s time that might be needed in other ways.

I have been struggling with an eating disorder for the past 2-3 years and been on the way of recovery a couple of times. It got worse last fall and I have been in group therapy for my disorder since January, but although I love going to the sessions the therapy itself hasn't been focusing on the right things for me. I have had a couple of individual meetings as well with the therapist and we have agreed to put me in another group in April. The question is whether to start me in the 5 days a week-group or just a different once a week group (yeah, that's quite a difference). The decision is going to be made by a nurse next Tuesday.

At first I really didn't want to be in the 5 days a week-group, but now I have completely switched. My fear now is that the nurse is not going to think I'm ill enough. I want to be completely honest with her but the thought of only having one appointment a week scares the crap out of me. Right now my entire life revolves around this disorder and I really can't take it any longer. I have had a couple of bad experiences with not being takes seriously by medical professionals, and the past couple of weeks I have actively gotten myself deeper into this disorder just to try to convice them that I need this help.

I feel really guilty about my behaviour, as if I could actually do it on my own but I just don't want to, and instead I'm taking the place of someone who would need it more. I don't know if I actually would make it with only once a week sessions, I haven't so far, but I keep feeling that if I just decided to get better, I would.

 Recently (about a month ago) I began seeing a girl who has struggled with an eating disorder in the past. We haven't spoken about it at length, as I want to let her share things when she feels comfortable, but I know that her difficulties peaked more than six years ago and since then she has mostly recovered.

 She does not seem to have any trouble eating around me or others. I should also state that I really like this girl, and am thrilled to be spending time with her. The specific problem that I've run in to is that she generally won't take off her shirt during sex. I have stopped asking because I don't want her to feel pressured to do something she doesn't want, especially in an intimate setting, but I can't lie it is a little frustrating. Not only because the superficial part of me enjoys seeing her naked, but also because it feels like the clothing represents something of an emotional barrier between us.

 I don't want her to think I'm judging her, or that there's any chance I might find her unattractive if I look to close, or anything like that.
I guess really what I'm looking for is some context around what she may be thinking and whether or not I can help. Is this just a question of waiting and being supportive so that she can become more comfortable around me? 

Above all I just want her to feel like she doesn't have to be worried about what I think of her.","Request: Seeing a girl who recovered from an eating disorder, questions about sex",https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fk2pgu/request_seeing_a_girl_who_recovered_from_an/,1584460970,17-03-20 5:02

As a way to possibly keep improving the subreddit two surveys have been created. One survey to measure the current state of the subreddit. This allows you to give feedback on possible improvements and/or things that COULD / SHOULD change.

There's a difference between COULD / SHOULD. When you select stuff that SHOULD change you want it to be ASAP. Your reading experience would drastically improve.

If you select SHOULD then you'd like to see it but it won't affect your reading experience that much. 

#[Feedback survey](https://forms.gle/WSDw82NS9vvbFt2C7)

The other is a survey with the question if we should start a moderated, safe and secure Discord server for people to chat with.

For those unaware what Discord is, here is a summary from the internet:

Discord is a free voice, video and text chat app for teens and adults ages 13 and up. It was created to bring people together through a love of gaming. 

People can access Discord via their PC, browser, or mobile phone. Once there, they can join a chat they’ve been invited to or they can create private servers and invite their friends to play and discuss games by voice, text or video. They can also message each other individually or in group chats with up to ten other friends.


Discord is different than other social platforms like Twitter or Reddit, in that people come to Discord to build private, invite-only groups. All conversations are opt-in, so anyone not interested in chatting have a variety of tools at their disposal:


* Choose who can direct message you
* Choose who can add you as a friend
* Choose what servers you want to partake in
* Choose whether or not to block another person
* Choose whether or not to scan and delete direct messages with explicit content
* Choose who can join your server
* Choose security and verification levels on your server

The current thought of the Discord is explained in the survey however this is not the final idea. Before we'd make the Discord server live we'd look into making it as safe as possible.

The only way to make it safe for the majority of users is if YOU help suggest ways to keep/make it safe.

The following is the posters actual emotions and thoughts. They can be very triggering so if you want to read the unedited version you can click on the spoiler tag.


&gt;!As I read through it, I guess I’m sort of within the binge eating disorder group, but I don’t want to acknowledge that because I wish I was bulimic or anorexic. Because then at least it would mean I was trying, I was compensating for the binges. Plus if I’m going to have a fucked up relationship with food either way, I’d rather have the ED that keeps me skinny. I feel so, so ashamed that I binge. If I was anorexic it would be tragic- but my problem is just disgusting and pathetic. People can make all the anti-body-positivity comments they want, saying they’re concerned for you- but the truth is, no one really cares about the fat girl.!&lt;

#For those not willing to read the spoiler here is a short summary rewritten.


I've been doing some research about eating disorders and I think that I'm a part of the binge eating disorder group. I'm having trouble accepting this as I'd rather have an ED that didn't make me binge. If I could switch my binging behavior for something else, even though something else is also not OK, I would instantly.

I’m aware these thoughts are sick. I’m aware I’m not even really overweight, my BMI is like 21.5. It’s like there’s a completely rational voice in me, but if you peel off the top layer, the controls are completely under the control of this second voice who just wants to be pretty, so fucking badly.
Perhaps because I’m so aware of other people’s appearances, I assume the rest of the world is as shallow and mean as I am. I like beautiful things, and I don’t know how to stop that. I constantly have judgements towards other fat, ugly people, and then immediately after I’ll mentally slap my own wrist. But just because I catch myself doesn’t stop the fact that I assume that these other people are less successful than me, less socially adept, have less romantic options, and are less happy than me. Why do I assume they’re less happy than me when clearly I’m so incredibly unhappy with myself already?
The worst part of this is that even after writing this, which I’m trying to make as completely honest and genuine and cathartic as possible, tomorrow, nothing will change.

I won’t get skinny. I won’t get that much fatter at a rate any faster than I currently am. I won’t feel better about my body.

I won’t get help because I know that this change has to come from me. The dietitian didn’t work. I won’t make it to the gym. I won’t tell anyone else about this. Nothing will change, except I will have to keep living with these disgusting thoughts that literally consume every second that I’m awake. I don’t know where to go from here.

I’ve noticed that the main points made by uploaders and commenters are:
- it helps the uploader keep themselves accountable and track recovery
- those videos don’t have to be made public and could instead be kept as a private journal
- it’s the viewer’s responsibility to judge if they’re okay with watching the video because of the trigger warnings and very blatant ED topic
- the video could come off as a glorification or tutorial
- they make other people with EDs feel less alone
- the thumbnails alone can be triggering

In my case, I don’t like to admit it but I think the videos do more harm. I used to watch restricting videos after binges to try and motivate myself to get back into the restrictive lifestyle out of guilt, but that would always lead to binging videos being recommended which would just reawaken the compulsion. Or I’d use binging videos as a twisted sense of comfort by telling myself “other people binge more than me so this slip up was okay.” I don’t see the point in publicly posting videos that could potentially encourage younger/desperate people or cause relapses, when they can be kept private and achieve the same goal of tracking progress.

now i’m back in that cycle of binge, restrict, repeat. what’s worse is that my first scheduled appointment with a therapist had to be cancelled and i was really relying on that to help me get through this with professional help. 
i feel so so upset with myself cause at this point i genuinely don’t know how to get better. i tried eating wholesome, healthy foods regularly with guiltless snacks because everything i read says that’s how to recover but it didn’t work so i really don’t know what to do. i think my main reason for binging is just an obsession with food and how good it tastes but then of course the self hatred and self esteem issues kick in and i restrict. i don’t know. at this point i’m ranting i just really need advice",Request: recovery seems impossible,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fontuv/request_recovery_seems_impossible/,1585152525,25-03-20 5:08

83,EDPostRequests,1584996684,fnrovb,"I don't want to say im feeling hopeless, but I feel like im stuck where I am in terms of recovery and don't know how to move forward. My eating disorder problems started in high school, where i slowly began restricting foods to the point where I developed full on anorexia, and barely ate anything for eight months. Around when all of this started, I began to feel more culturally aware of my surroundings (being a Korean raised in canada) and felt really shameful that my body wasn't like other asians. I was also engaged in a relationship at the time that praised my body for being so thin and 'beautiful',  making it hard to stop my disordered eating. After those eight months, I couldn't stop thinking about food and the urges of food and hated feeling so cold all the time, so I thought I could lessen the restrictions on my 'diet' and eat more. Before I knew it, I was binging on all the foods I could think of and managed to gain back all the weight I tried so hard to loose. I felt and still feel really fat and like I lost control of myself, and for compensation began purging. 

My bulimia has been going on for three years now, and I feel like I've tried everything to stop it. My face looks so bad now because of how swollen it is, my throat always hurts, and I feel like shit because of how I've lost all the self-control and temperance i trained myself to have. Last summer, I use to be throwing up at least five times a day, and was still putting on weight, and started cutting myself to pull myself back together in hopes of getting a reality check. I decided to go to an eating disorder clinic over the summer to finally talk to someone about these problems, but I also knew I would be moving provinces within the next three months because I couldn't stand the thought of putting all my dreams and ambitions aside just because of some fucking stupid eating disorder. Through the clinic I was told my binging was triggered by stress, and so in the summer I started only binging and purging maybe once a week or less, and unconsciously food slipped away from my focus. 

When i entered university after those three months of treatment, I hadn't binged for a couple weeks and was going strong, before all the sudden all I could think about was eating and purging, despite the lack if stress and the fact that I truly am studying something I love. I went to see a therapist for a couple sessions in hopes of stoping the ED because I felt myself swirling out of control, who then told me it was most likely a trauma response that I developed and eating disorder in the first place. I moved provinces because I wanted to follow my dreams but also because my father who I thought the world of had become abusive after he started taking a lot of drugs to cope with the pains he got from working so hard. After my therapist helped me solve some of the issues i buried in myself, I found that my binging and purging stopped in December up until I had to go home for Christmas break, where once again I experienced the rage and anger of my father and the constant fighting and yelling and threats and now I'm nearly back where I started, throwing up once every couple days. I don't know when I feel full anymore, and I feel like I don't have enough self control to stick to a meal plan to try and tackle my disordered eating. I hate my body and I think I look disgusting still, and I sincerely feel ashamed that Im not making any improvements on my mentality or this fucking disorder thats draining my wallet. 

The only other person who I told about my problems with bulimia was my mom, who in turn begged me to stop and called me selfish for wasting her money. I remember one day I came crying to her because I couldn't throw up the food i binged and that i would become fat, and she told me that she was going to kill herself if she kept seeing what I was doing, or that if she died it was because I caused so much stress onto her. I don't know how to talk to anything about these problems. I don't know what to do anymore.

My family has always pressured me with matters regarding body weight, no matter in which side of the spectrum I am, so I usually end up slipping back into old patterns and that terrifies me because I want to fall back but at the same time I just want to be a normal human being and not damage my body.
I had picked up the gym and was going consistently even if I was still to afraid to start a weight loss focused diet with a dietitian because I tend to get hooked in a bad way, so I first focused on feeling better.
Not long ago I went to an assessment and if it wasn’t due to the huge leaps I made while in therapy I’d be in a relapse, I was told I was obese and I had to do something about it. The issue here is, I can exercise but my family is not kind when for x reason I decide I’m not in the mood and the last thing I wish is to do it obsessively like in the past. 
This constant pressure I’m receiving from them is damaging my already low self esteem and the obsessive thoughts have returned.

So, for the past 4 days I had kinda a relapse. I was going to get my period, I was much more hungry and I started the B/p cycle again. I hated it, I hate myself for doing this to me, because I'm experiencing not only the period cramps but also the physical consequences on eating like a pig and vomiting. Food could sit on my stomach for HOURS and nothing helped it.

Yesterday I also had a day where I just ate so so much, after my bf pointed out that starving wasn't really helping me. We had an apero, I got drunk, I ate a lot. Too much.

I did the mistake on measuring myself today. I got more kgs respect to last week and i feel super super bad. I exercised everyday but yesterday, so I dont understand how could I even gain so much weight... My guess is that it's edema. That's what I hope at least.

I want to stop with this cycle because it kills me. I just want to stop the b/p and return to be healtier like I was last week.

Can someone give me some advice on how to repair to this? Is it an edema or did I really gain weight?

fast forward years later. i was in a 4 year relationship and found out i got cheated on then broke up with. i did not take it well. i would look in the mirror and cry for hours. during that period i didnt eat. the sight and thought and smell of food disgusted me. i lost a lot of weight. i started liking the way i looked and restricted myself more n more. after a few months i gained the weight back by binge eating. 

now im starting the process all over expect now if i eat something at all i feel so guilty and purge. i restrict myself from eating anything as well as working out everyday. my mom picked up on the fact i have been doing this, and said she would take me to the hospital. but i lied and said i eat when shes at work, she believed me.

98,EDPostRequests,1585862416,ftutnh,"Hi there, thank you all so much for your support! The comments on my recent post where very helpful, even though I am still swinging between contemplation and action regarding my eating disorder. So far I have managed it to admit that I have a problem and agree with my therapist to work on it. I haven´t stepped on the scale for 6 weeks now and I didn´t throw up for 2 months. 

The next step I wanted to take is to regulate my eating and it went terribly wrong. For the past 7 years I ate a low carb/high protein diet and started to limit my calories to a small deficit and a cheat day once per week, which made me lose a lot of weight back then. This diet worked well over the years, I didn´t mind going of my restriction during holidays and my cheat days were quite moderate, mostly going out and checking out a new restaurant or cooking something with friends. I wouldn't consider myself having an eating disorder back then. 

The last 3 years have been a rough time and I started to have immense orgies on my cheat days and fear that I would gain weight. I was obsessing about it and started with purging, also turned more restrictive in everyday life and was even afraid I could gain weight if I ate fruits. I got to the point where I am very restrictive and have a massive binge once per week. 

I eat three meals a day, but everything is proportioned and always high in protein. I listened to many podcasts before I became aware that I actually might have an eating disorder, but I wasn't convinced that all of this applies to me. 
Still, considering the last comments on my posts I had to courage to tackle my eating behaviour and I learned by now that restriction is the root of my cravings and binges. I liked the podcast by Tabitha Farah a lot and even though I was sceptical about the ""recovery feasts"" she suggests, I wanted to give it a try and see if the mental hunger stops and a natural feeling of saturation reoccurs if I allow myself to eat everything I want.

 The first two days it was ok, I ate a lot of sweets and bread, everything I craved, on the third day I already felt sick from all the food but somehow the longing to eat didn´t stop. After five days I already felt so disgusted by myself and ashamed that I couldn´t take it anymore. I ran 10km every day, put away all the mirrors in my apartment and restricted my food intake to a minimum. After a few days I dared it to raise it to my normal calorie intake, even though I am still feeling awfu

l. It was so bad that I was ashamed to go back to work because of my weight gain. There is no way I can do this. I don´t know if this is an intervention only for people with severe anorexia ( according to the BMI I am only slightly underweight) but this doesn't work for me. I am not at the point yet that I could tolerate weight gain, heck, I can't even tolerate my body with the lowest weight I allowed myself to go to. Maybe, instead of letting loose of all restriction, I could try to incorporate eating something I crave for every day, but in an normal amount? 

The problem is that I lose all control once I dare to eat something ""forbidden"", also I have no feeling of hunger or saturation. Maybe I could try to loosen all the rules I have for food like this and break the cycle of restricting, binging and purging, but I am scared that I won´t manage it. In addition, I feel like I would need the scale to assure myself that I won´t get fat if I eat a sandwich for lunch or just one cookie a day. This feels so overwhelming that there is another part of my suggesting to go back to the way it was before, strict diet plan and training, occasional cheat days.

 It´s not that I am enjoying my regular food, I actually like my diet, I like to eat by the clock and according to a plan, and a cheat day once per month used to be enough for me.

I live with my sister (25) and she has been bulimic for over 10 years. I don’t know if I should talk to her about it (if yes, how?) or should I just leave her alone (advice I got). 

I asked her about her “vomiting” years ago &amp; she was very defensive and angry about it. 

I find it really uncomfortable to witness... seeing her binge eating (knowing she will throw it all up later), seeing vomit stains on the toilet bowl, seeing regurgitated food in small trash bags.

I admit I do feel disturbed by it. However I don’t want her to feel judged or ashamed about this. When I see her binge eating, I feel confused, sometimes angry (idky), but ultimately I feel sad.

It’s sad seeing her like this. She seems to have this unrealistic idea of “beauty” - &amp; does fillers, botox, BA, etc to achieve that look. And I don’t think she does it for herself, she loves attention / compliments from others. 


I want her to feel beautiful &amp; love herself for herself.
Typing it all out, I realised the issue is not bulimia itself but her whole idea of beauty &amp; her desire to achieve it. 

Personally, I feel guilty about my own emotions. I want to be a supportive sister, but I can’t help but have some negative feelings towards all these. It’s frustrating to see her like this.

When she was in high school before I met her she struggled with anorexia and went through treatment. When we met she was most likely on the lower end of being considered overweight, but was in a relatively good place. During our time together we had both put on a fair bit of weight, and decided last summer to try to lose a little weight. From Last September through January we both lost a fair bit. She was down to just into a medically healthy weight, and I'm at least where I was when we met.

The issue I am having trouble empathizing with arose the last couple months after a couple vacations where we both allowed ourselves to loosen up on our diet plans causing us to stall out at our current weight. We're both right near where we were two months ago which I would consider an okay weight range, but my wife's original plan was a little lower than that. 

The last couple weeks she has switched back and forth from eating almost nothing to eating without any restriction and has confided in me that its causing her a great deal of anxiety and feelings of depression and even mentioned suicide. I want to believe that if she can reach her goal she will be able to redevelop a healthy relationship with food and will overall help her mental health, but I have no personal experience with any of these conditions.

Do any of you have any advice on things I can do to be supportive and to help her reach her goals? Maybe any general information on eating disorders.

Some background: I have been calorie conscious since 2nd grade. I am from a family not obsessed with health but obsessed with weight. Even our height wall included weight. Even at these young grade school ages these ""health"" kicks would include full body measurements. I would work out daily and restrictive diet was added into that. 

Then in high school I discovered thermogenics and fat burners. I took more than the instructed doses and this continued through the first half of college, where I made sure to limit calories to a low limit every day.

Between plateauing and an abusive relationship the depression and anxiety then turned into binge eating. I gave up one bad for another. Gained back all I lost plus reinforcements. 

With some help I started to recover a couple years ago. No more fatburners or calorie restrictions but a modified meal plan to at least keep the foods healthy and allow for occasional cheat meals. 

Now in quarantine I'm back in the circumstances that started that first kick way back when and have even started thoughts of limiting food to bites/hr. I'm scared to return but also thinking I would be happier to be that skinny again so what's the harm?

My problem, though, lies with exercise. Even though I was in therapy for my issues, they mainly focused on my food issues and not my exercise issues. I feel really unbalanced because I feel perfectly fine mentally until it comes to my ""physical health"". And by that I mean any form of exercise

I feel like crying literally any time I work out, I have to stop working out everytime because I feel so awful. It's like the thoughts of back then come to consume every part of my mind and make me want to relapse. Since exercise makes me feel awful, I just stopped exercising period.

First, I'm in denial about if this is a problem. I'm going ""well I am able to keep my calories up so it's fine"". I think deep down inside me, I know I'm not okay. I'm thinking about food constantly. I'm really struggling with not wanting to eat, even when I'm hungry. I'm calorie counting, which I started because I knew I wasn't eating enough (to force myself to eat more) but now it's devolved and I won't let myself ""overeat"" (calorie goal on this tracker is based on my MBR/activity level and is approximately the correct TDEE, not an ED-warped low calorie goal). But I don't feel like it's ""as bad"" because I am still able to force feed myself. I've read posts on this sub, searching for answers to these questions, and it just feels like I'm not that bad and others deserve the support more. And how do I even figure out what level of support I need? Do I just keep fumbling along until this trigger is gone, and then pick up the pieces?

Second, I don't know how to tell friends and ask for support. We're all stuck at home and video calling and whatnot. I don't want to bring more negativity into their life, and it feels like ""my problem"". I don't know how to tell friends, but I need to, because I'm struggling and need the support. I don't want to talk about it with them, but I simultaneously really want to be able to get this off my chest. At the same time I feel like an imposter using the ED label, because I am not struggling and undereating nearly as much as some folks do.

After years of this, years of being unable to go three hours without vomiting, much less one full day — I managed to stop. I had to quit dating entirely, because this was a massive tigger for me, but I felt this was life or death. I stopped modeling, stopped swimming.

Monday will be 100 days. The longest I’d previously gone since childhood was 33.

It’s a strange time to be in recovery: the isolation is actually helpful, because there’s no concern about what people see or think, day to day. But I’m also left completely to my devices, which has historically been bad news for the binging side of things.

I think the true savior has been the fact that going to the grocery store is frowned upon. So I don’t. I have what I need, but I don’t binge because I don’t know when I’ll go shopping again.

And now, 100 days. I don’t know what to do with myself.

132,EDPostRequests,1586488474,fy74ag,"Hi everyone. So I've struggled with my weight my whole life. I was an overweight child, and in my adult life I go back and forth between unconsciously over-eating and gaining weight, and then starving myself to the point of worryingly excessive weight loss because of body image. At the moment, I'm probably the heaviest I've ever been.

I've always thought of myself as someone who just has a big appetite but it hit me recently that its something a bit deeper than that. In a nutshell, when I was little my Grandma's house was a place where I felt quite content and secure. Being doted on, allowed to do whatever I want, and MASSIVELY overfed. I've realised that the reason I feel the need to eat so much is because my psyche has linked eating with that sense of security. I've also dealt with anxiety for a number of years, and this explains why my immediate reaction to experiencing a panic-attack is to just eat and eat like a man possessed until it subsides.

I feel like cracking this may be the first stage to getting my eating and my weight on track, rather than the extreme yo-yo dieting pattern I've developed. But I'm not sure how to go about untangling it, I'd be very grateful if anyone has any advice!

133,EDPostRequests,1586414960,fxnjej,"Hi, I really need advice from the community, my exact post is as followed:




I really need assistance with my wife...I don’t know what to do anymore.

Backstory:
My wife and I are in our early 30’s, we’ve
been together for about 6 years, and married for almost 2 years. We also have a young child together. Prior to us getting together, she was heavily into hard drugs, and when we got together she was still secretly using, but ended up quitting altogether shortly after we got together (I think, unrelated but wanted to say anyway)

Story:
The whole time we’ve been together, she has also struggled with Bulimia, she will binge eat and purge daily, if not multiple times a day. I try to bring up the subject probably every few months, and it turns into a screaming argument, which I have to admit I end up blowing up because she refuses to talk about it. I’ve accused her of not caring about it, I’ve accused her of taking it too lightly, accused of multiple things like that, which I now know is the complete opposite of what I should’ve been doing. 

I’ve been doing a lot of research on it lately and realize that it is an addiction, and it’s not as easy as it may seem to stop. 

I brought up the subject again tonight, after she ate several pizzas, several bowls of cereal, tons of random junk food, in like a 30 minute period, and I wanted her to know it is safe to talk about it with me, and I love her so much and I care about her immensely, but I’m concerned about her health and well-being. It is something that can kill you. And I will be your biggest supporter, and again she refused to discuss it, got extremely defensive and angry, and it turned into another massive screaming fight. A lot of our fights start because of this, I’ll find empty junk food boxes hidden around the house, wrappers stuffed in the couch, etc and it drives me crazy.  I usually go to bed earlier than her, and I’ll hear her sneak into the garage every night, where I know she is getting more food that she hid.  I feel like she doesn’t care or take it serious, but I have to remember the reality of the situation. It is an addiction, there is my wife, my best friend, the woman of my dreams who I would do anything for, and there is the other side, with the addiction. 

We’ve never actually even talked about it the entire time we’ve been together, I’ve caught her a few times purging, and you can hear it throughout the house when she’s doing it, and she admitted it to me shortly after we got together but wouldn’t discuss any further. When I bring it up, she will usually get furious, extremely defensive, divert things that I’m doing that are bad, like usually tell me she is fine, all sorts of things kill people, I refuse to talk about it, don’t ask me about it again!!

When it is apart of her daily routine “binge and purge” time, her attitude does a complete 180, she won’t speak to me, tries to get away from me as fast as she can, doesn’t want anything to do with me, she is a completely different person when you it’s about that time. 

I’ve gotten to the point over the last week or so I will say random, encouraging, things to her, like “I believe in you, you’re strong and you can beat this”, etc. and she just laughs and blows it off, and is basically annoyed by the comments. I feel so powerless in this, and I feel like I cannot allow this to continue without any sort of dialogue between us, and some sort of a plan to address it.  FYI she is at a healthy weight, and has maintained close to the same healthy weight the whole time we’ve been together. 

But my point in writing this, I’m scared, I’m scared for my wife, I’m scared for our family, I want to help her in any way I can, I love my wife dearly and I want to continue to stay with her for the rest of my life, but how do I convince her she needs to seek real help, and is there anything I can do to help her?",Request: I would like to post a question on your page,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fxnjej/request_i_would_like_to_post_a_question_on_your/,1586436560,09-04-20 1:49

Today I found a picture of my teeth right when I got my braces off 7ish years ago. I took the photo and started comparing to my teeth now and I was shocked. I had never noticed before, but my gums have receded a noticeable amount. I have also noticed that I have developed cracks in my gum line starting from my teeth.

I’m horrified. My teeth feel fine but these things cannot be healthy. I thought that because I was doing well that my teeth wouldn’t be this damaged. I wish I knew when the gum recession started but I noticed the cracks forming about 4 days ago and thought nothing of it. But now that I see the gum recession I’m worried about the cracks.

Has anyone dealt with this? I obviously should see my dentist but considering the state of the world I can’t exactly do that at the moment.

I guess what I’m wondering is if anyone has restored their teeth and what can I do to help ease the mouth decay other than stop purging entirely?

138,EDPostRequests,1586380015,fxewf9,"I equate my weight with my self-worth in a different sort of way then usual

To make this clear I absolutely do not and would never do this to anyone but myself 

I’m 5’2 and (a normal BMI) currently, which makes me feel worthless. It’s a very average weight and I seem to derive self-esteem from being “different” and having enough restraint to be a very low weight 

I used to weigh a lot less than I currently do. I obsessively track my calories (even more at the time) and compare my BMI to others. Any half-pound I lost or gained I would obsess over, and I’d measure myself repeatedly to make sure I was getting smaller or at least not bigger. I had a 21.5-inch waist which I was incredibly proud of because of how abnormally small of a measurement that was, and I wanted to lose more weight so it would be smaller. At my current weight it’s 24 inches and I can only wear baggy clothes because that’s too big and normal and I don’t identify with it

I don’t know if this gives an impression of being vain but I definitely never was, again I only had these standards for myself and actually hated the shit out of myself. I felt like I had no real worth or way of expressing myself other than through my body. It was not in a way of being sexually attractive either, just being able to show my pain and control externally in a way that I identified with

I did not and honestly still don’t identify with my body at an “average” weight. I wear baggy clothes thinking that I’ll wear more revealing clothes once I get below a certain weight. I’m currently stuck in a binge/purge cycle of some sort (I don’t vomit, just fast for days).

 I probably would have qualified as anorexic when I was thinner but don’t even know what I would be anymore. Even at my lowest weight (which fit the BMI criteria for anorexia, though I was never diagnosed) I didn’t really look skinny, just small, and I even had a family member say I was skinny-fat which would trigger me more. I wanted to be boney and “abnormally” thin, enough that no one would question it for a second

I wouldn’t say I had the kind of body dysmorphia that anorexics are typically portrayed as having. Although I’m very critical of myself I didn’t exactly see myself as overweight. I just wanted to see myself as underweight. Not attractive in a conventional sense. I wanted to be unusual, I felt that making my outside appearance unusual would match more closely to how I felt internally 

I actually remember some amount of this starting when I was a child, in elementary school. I hated being called cute. I’d scratch my skin up and wear black and rub my eyes to make my dark circles under them worse. I was small and had light blonde hair which I hated because people would tend to see me as some kind of wholesome innocent American girl. I think my kind of reserved personality made these impressions and thus my opinions about myself worse since people didn’t have as much to judge from. And I felt like I didn’t have much of a way of expressing it since society puts so much stock into corporeal existence as a reflection of who we are anyways. Especially girls

TL;DR if you want a look inside the mind of one individual with an eating disorder of some kind then I guess this is it. I don’t know how typical this kind of reasoning or whatever you want to call it is",Request: My mind during an eating disorder cycle,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fxewf9/request_my_mind_during_an_eating_disorder_cycle/,1586401615,08-04-20 16:06
139,EDPostRequests,1586379880,fxeuxy,"For some background information, my ED started when I was a senior in high school in 2017. (Another main trigger towards my downward spiral is when I found out my ex-boyfriend of 4 years was cheating on me with so many different women). I lost the one person who kept me feeling somewhat okay about my body. I began to binge every night and gaining weight fast. 
I also live with my grandparents who are old school with every fucking thing you can think of. With my grandmother wanting to portray me as perfect, she noticed my weight gain from binging almost every night and not leaving my room. She would make constant remarks towards my body and still does til this day. I find myself at 4 am standing in the mirror staring at my body thinking what is wrong. All the sudden from eating so much in one day, I started to regret eating food so I barely eat one meal a day. I will throw my dinner away or anything my family makes in my room so they do not know about it. 
I was wanting fast results for weight loss which led me to lie to get Adderall. This is where I currently stand. I have a previous addiction with pills which I was sober for 5 years. I am sure damn proud of myself overcoming that but now I am fighting an old demon and a new demon. Adderall keeps me from eating all day because I kept having them up the MG. Sometimes I feel sort of faint so I will eat something small and only really drink water. With this whole quarantine thing going on, I had an epiphany a few nights ago and decided I need to make a change. I am tired of feeling guilty. 
I am unsure to tell my therapist about this. I have mentioned to her previously that I struggle with eating. I have not told her about the Adderall nor does she know I take it. I am kind of scared to tell her. I just need some opinions or an approachable way with this.

I get heart palpitations and muscle twitches. The corners of my lips are cracked due to lack of vitamin B.
When I do eat, I eat extremely small portions to the point that it’s embarrassing to go out to eat with a group because I hardly eat anything (I.e. I would feel “full” after about 1 cup of pasta or a piece of pizza) I absolutely hate feeling food in my stomach, especially when I know what I’ve eaten is unhealthy.

145,EDPostRequests,1586240390,fwfe9e,"Hey everyone... basically i need to talk this out. 

I’ve been binge eating for about 3 weeks. I actually had gotten into eating regular meals regular amounts of food (regular meaning appropriate servings of healthy organic food) prepared myself. 

I was off chocolate, bread, and my salt intake had increased considerably.  I’ve been eating chocolate (no cane sugar though). 

Returning to where i live after being away for about 3 months and having to stay here due to lock down has really triggered me. 

I'm having big issues with binging.. It's gotten real worse. The only rule i had was “don’t throw up”.
The rule worked and i went 6 months without barfing.  It worked i stopped throwing up, i started eating more regularly and losing weight, but the recovery was linked to some other things. 

Then the mold nightmare happened at the cricket house and i understood the binge purge was directly related to black/toxic mold exposure. I was rejecting food (wanting to get rid of it) and not being able to digest, sometimes it would die and ferment in my stomach. 

I’ve been living alternatively for the last 2 ¾ years after the cricket house (in my car by choice) because I’m afraid of mold in the residences which is typical for my area.  The mold toxicity is so terrible god me i’d rather live in my car in the forest. 

Circumstances changed and i was getting very panicked in the car, this was about three weeks ago. I literally thought i was gonna go crazy, stark raving mad.  Due to lockdown i was offered use of a mini cabin - a room with a wood stove and MIRRORS. 

I think the mirrors are fucking with me. I only use them to check my hairdo and buggers or other you know, glaringly gross stuff. But the mirrors - i judge myself... my shape, my weight, i actually have body dysmorphia - i look different ( my face) every time i look. I understand that not all mirrors are, lets say quality or standardized. My face looks completely different in my car visor mirror compared to my rear view. One of the cabin mirrors is a fun house mess with my mind mirrors. 

Regarding potential mold... the cabin seems fine but i overate and purged the other day. That’s is a once or twice a year *choice* now because if i engage in bulimic behaviors i won’t know if i am in a mold exposure situation. The vomiting due to mold is involuntary and also related to inability digestive, poop and other issues. 

There has been a push to fast again but this is another culprit in my eating disorder cycle. 

I’m overwhelmed by my feelings for a lovely man but can’t read the situation.  I am looping on our interactions, lost opportunities, separation with the locking down... what if he decided or got stuck while he was traveling (SA or Canada).  The lost opportunities Nov 2018 thru May 2019 loop in my brain.

First post, apologies for the length: I am a senior in college (home due to COVID19) that has struggled with anorexia (occasionally binge eating) all four years of college. I came into college around xxx pounds (5""1' - normal BMI) never thinking about what I ate, started restricting what/how much I was eating pretty intensely to the point that I would count all my calories and have binge eating episodes (only when I came home) and had access to a lot of food that was not ""nutritionally efficient"" and that I had been depriving myself of.

Last spring I was around xxx pounds (underweight BMI), not exercising really at all but very busy. This past summer I weighed myself every day and was around xxx pounds (still underweight BMI), eating yyy calories - a low number (I think - I don't know that this is accurate but it is what I was aiming for) or so calories every day and exercising pretty hard 4 or 5 days a week trying to gain muscle.

This past fall semester I made the decision to try to gain weight to protect my organs. I got rid of my scale at school and gradually gained weight to around xxx pounds (back into low end of normal BMI) eating quite a bit more (closer to xxx a day - a normal amount) but also cycling heavily because I didn't want to gain ""just fat"", up to 50 miles on the weekends. For the past few months (all of 2020) I have been at this weight even eating only xxx calories ( a very low number)  a day but not cycling as much and still gradually gaining weight. At the point that I was still gaining weight on xxx calories a day I decided I needed to actually fix my metabolism and stop obsessing.

Even though I'm back now near where my natural weight was before college, I think my metabolism is severely messed up from doing this for so long. I had read in the past that the only way to fix deprivation for so long is something akin to the ""Homeodynamic Recovery Method"" or eating a completely unrestricted diet so your body can adjust to having more than enough nutrients. Is this true? Is that what I should be doing even if I'm not severely underweight anymore?

I am the older sister of an anorexia sufferer, and we just found out she struggles with this tonight. I’m home from college because of COVID and found her throwing up because she hadn’t eaten all day and was using drugs (adderall, but previously laxatives) to try to lose weight. It was very very traumatic and my dad and I were able to help her and make sure she was okay (paramedics came) but of course now we are aware of the larger problem. I really don’t know what to do because this feels incredibly scary for me especially as she was saying all these things about how she’s jealous of me and how I weigh more than her but I’m thinner etc etc. I’m aware of the workings of anorexia from a psychology standpoint and know these are disordered thoughts but it still feels personal because of course she’s my sister and I’m not a therapist. I’m glad we seem to have caught it early but it seems like an impossible road ahead and I really need some support that she will be okay because I really don’t want to lose her, I can’t express how scary tonight was and I feel really selfish for being afraid because I know she’s the one suffering but it’s so so hard.

151,EDPostRequests,1586130344,fvo1v3,"My sister and I have both returned to the family home from university due to COVID-19 (I’m 20, she is 23). 

For some limited context, my sister developed anorexia when she was about 14/15, and as a previously very tight-knit family of 4 it took a huge toll on our family dynamic. Nonetheless, the investment of my parents in helping her and her own determination to gain weight back ‘for the family’ (in hindsight definitely not the best path to recovery) meant that by around 19/20 she was back at what would be considered a normal weight and eating regular meals. However, the recovery (as always) was not an easy one which has contributed to other issues developing out of the original anorexia (e.g. depression, self harm, suicide attempts). Within the family there has been a breakdown of trust as a result of her feeling unable to share her problems with us, or not being honest about issues she still has with eating and generally being caught out in lies surrounding behaviour she is trying to hide. Despite all this, since about September last year the general trend has been (cautiously) upwards seemingly both in her mental health and our relationship as a family. However, now we are all home again under the same roof for an indeterminate amount of time, cracks are definitely starting to show and I’m extremely worried about how to cope with the situation.

The main thing I want to ask advice on is my suspicion that my sister is still making herself sick sometimes after meals. This habit developed out of her anorexia and would not be considered bulimia (I think the term is anorexia purge-type, when restricting food intake no longer becomes sustainable for the body but the feeling of being full even from a normal amount of food is unbearable, resulting in vomiting). We were aware this was happening when she was around 16-18, but had thought it was something she had managed to get past (even though in hindsight our attempts as a family to help her get over this probably weren’t helpful — we didn’t really have any experience in how best to tackle it). It was kind of assumed the main trigger for it was having to cope with the (larger) family meal in the evening, which we always tend to eat together. There has been one instance since we’ve all been home this time where there was concrete evidence she had thrown up after dinner (I had a suspicion, didn’t mention it at the time, but later went to check the outside bin she had offered to empty the kitchen bin into, and found sick), and we tried to talk as a family about it in a non-confrontational way the day after. She insisted it was not something she does now (apparently this was the only time she had done it since she had been home), but very occasionally in moments of tension or weakness it becomes a crutch for her to fall back on. She also was keen to stress it was not about weight and wanting to lose it, but about the feeling of relief and control it gave her after being stressed by family tension. I am concerned this is not a completely honest explanation, and am slightly worried that my own increased exercise and healthy eating attitudes since the start of this year are triggering her. That particular evening had also not seemed to be tense at all, which made the explanation confusing. As a family we have now all been trying to do things to reduce tension, but this does feel sometimes like we’re walking around on eggshells, not pointing out or bringing up behaviour that seems concerning for fear of stressing her out, even though trying to ignore it is difficult. 

Around 2 weeks on from this incident, I think there have been more times where she has thrown up after meals, but I have not brought them up or mentioned them to my parents because I’m worried this won’t help. Essentially, I’m wondering what to do — try and talk to her again, or accept that this is something I cannot change or help her with, and try my best to ignore it? There is in environment in our home at the moment of everyone watching each other — my sister has felt watched for years due to the breakdown of trust between her and my parents, I now feel my sister watching me and my eating habits, and I feel my parents and I watching her and never really being able to work out what the truth is (whether we’re overly suspicious and paranoid due to past experiences, or whether our instincts are right and there are valid reasons to be worried about her still). I know that this is taking a real toll on my parents too and their relationship both with my sister and with each other, but I don’t know how to help resolve it. Should we keep ignoring the throwing up, as it seems to be the one thing she completely and utterly cannot be honest with us about, or try and resolve it through more conversation? Another issue to consider is that unless there is concrete, undeniable evidence that she has vomited, she will completely deny any suggestion that she might have — and if she suspects that you might think this has happened even if you don’t say anything (e.g. if I become quieter or less engaged with her after a meal), she will tackle you on it, trying to make you say you believe that she has not. It seems to be really important to her that her family thinks well of her and is not worrying, even if it does seem to us that there is a valid reason to be. So I’m not sure what to do.

I (F18) just moved back home from college due to all the coronavirus stuff going on and school being cancelled. So I really don’t know how long this has been going on, I didn’t notice anything over winter break so at the most this could have been going on since January. 

My sister (14) and I usually hang out in the living room before going to bed, watching tv, me getting work done, etc. I usually go to bed before her, but tonight I had something to finish up and turn in so I stayed in the living room. She said goodnight, and went upstairs, and I heard her go into the bathroom. It’s right at the top of the stairs and the walls are pretty thin so anyone downstairs can hear what’s going on. It sounded like she turned on both sinks and then I heard her retching and throwing up into the toilet. At first I thought she was sick, but then I remembered hearing something similar from upstairs a couple of nights before and I just ignored it. 

So I went upstairs and knocked on the door and asked if she was ok, and she said “yeah, just brushing my teeth” sounding a bit angry/defensive? I said “hey I heard you throw up, i just wanted to make sure you were fine” and she was silent. I waited outside until she came out and asked her again if she was fine, if she was sick/if she needed anything and she told me she didn’t throw up, that she just briefly choked on water while brushing her teeth. That didn’t make sense to me and didn’t explain the other night so I told her about the other night as well and she just got more and more defensive. I didn’t know what to do so I just told her I’d be there for her if she needed to talk and said goodnight and left. 

I’m really overwhelmed and I don’t know what to do. My sister has a history of self harm issues and body insecurity but nothing I’ve really seen from her before would lead me to believe she had an eating disorder except for this. She won’t talk to me or anyone, she’s very private and stubborn and won’t accept help.

My talking to her about it may cause me to lose my sister’s trust, but it might be worth it if she needs help??

Taking my weight/height in account I’m currently underweight and I’ve been amenorrheic for a few months. No one besides my boyfriend knows that I have anxiety towards food. But in this past month I’ve made alot of progress in increasing the amount of food I eat. I’ve also only purged once which is atleast progress from the amount I did in the past.

Although I’m making alot of progress on my own, I’m still worried about the anxieties I still have about food and I know I could be doing more but its just difficult to do it alone. Currently, my method is setting a rough amount of calories/food that I’ll let myself eat each day and then weighing myself once a week so I can alter that amount if my weight lowers. Should I be making bigger steps? I’m currently still loosing weight which scares me because I am eating more and, although I’m trying hard to get to a healthy weight, my mind doesn’t see the loss as a negative. And at the same time, I feel alot of disgust towards how being this weight makes me look and feel. 

I don’t know, I’m sorry if this is all rambly or unclear but I guess what I’m asking for is advice on how to make bigger steps towards progress without old weight loss habits or fear kicking in. And if theres anything big that I need to do in order to properly get better that would be helpful too.",Request: Making bigger steps towards progress?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/g3lakc/request_making_bigger_steps_towards_progress/,1587226510,18-04-20 5:15
161,EDPostRequests,1587204900,g3laic,"It’s been on my mind for a while but I’ve never actually spoken to anyone about it because it’s hard for me to even attempt to admit to myself.

Since about age 16-17 my appetite slowed down. I still generally have a pretty low appetite. I personally blame it on high amounts of anxiety. But because of that I started losing weight and it made me feel so much better about myself physically. Then ever since then I noticed I was a lot harder on myself about eating. And still am to this day.

It’s feelings and thoughts that I can’t even shake. If I eat more than once a day, I feel guilty. Even sometimes when I do eat at all. I guess it just depends on my mood. 

If I go a day or two without eating I’m proud of myself. When I lay in bed and try to sleep my brain will go through and try to think of any little thing I ate that day. The lower the amount, the better I feel. But if I ate more than I feel I should have I instantly feel horrible and think “well I won’t eat that much tomorrow. It’ll make up for this.” 

If I feel an empty feeling in my stomach I tell myself I can truck through it. No matter what I always feel like there’s more weight I could be losing.

I know that me thinking that way isn’t good. I guess I’m just scared of admitting to myself that I may have a problem. I also wanted opinions from you guys who are more informed on eating disorders than I am myself. (I don’t know a whole lot about them as a whole.)

So I guess the question is. Do I have an eating disorder? And if so is there any way I can try not to have these thoughts/feelings? Should I look into seeking help?

There are many great resources in the English speaking community like mentor programs and online self help groups but unfortunately I could not find anything similar for the German speaking community. There is an over-eaters-anonymous group in the city I live in, but I am not religious which makes me reluctant to join the meetings.

I’m hungry when I wake up. I can’t start the work day without breakfast or else I can’t concentrate and feel dizzy or lightheaded and distracted by hunger. I’m not one of those people who can just have a coffee and be fine until lunch. 

My boyfriend, who I live with, is the opposite. He can just have some coffee, lie in bed and look at his phone, and not need food for hours. If he does have something it’ll be like a handful of nuts or a protein bar while I cook a whole breakfast with eggs and stuff. He’s over a foot taller than me and never worries about gaining weight no matter how much he eats so already it’s hard to not compare myself to him. 

I feel so embarrassed when I wake up in the morning feeling hungry and wanting breakfast. I can’t bring myself to say “I’m hungry” and I feel like if I make breakfast I have to hide it. I feel ashamed that I need food when I wake up but someone so much bigger than me doesn’t. Sometimes I’ll make myself wait several hours until he’s hungry and wants to eat with me.

167,EDPostRequests,1587078498,g2pyuw,"So my roommate had an eating disorder that she recovered from a couple of years ago after going to rehab. 

She was recently in a relationship for 10 months and really happy (though most of our friends didn’t much care for the guy). When I met her she was healthy and exercised and ate well, but throughout her time dating this guy she gained a significant amount of weight and became very insecure and depressed. Despite that, she continued eating out for most meals and eating high carb and high fat diet (mostly pizza, bread, pasta, fried food, ice cream) and doesn’t exercise or drink water or eat fruits of vegetables. She would constantly complain about her appearance and clothes not fitting, but wouldn’t do anything to change her habits. She stopped drinking about 3 months ago and began going to Alcoholics Anonymous, so I’m not sure if food was like a replacement for alcohol for her. 

Anyway, she and her boyfriend had a bad breakup last weekend with no chance for reunion and since then she has barely eaten. I’ve seen her eat just one piece of toast each day since Saturday. Since we are in quarantine together, I definitely notice when she’s eating. 

I prepare healthy meals and go for lots of walks and do workouts at home most days. I’ve tried to help by inviting her to join or offered her meals but she always declines.

I’ve been going to Pyschologists and psychiatrists since I was a young girl in regards to my other problems - I have told them EVERYTHING in hopes of gaining control of my bipolar and ptsd, and I have gotten better in that aspect of my life.

I have recently gotten into great shape physically and controlled my diet to where I haven’t felt the need to fall back into my old ways. 

With the recent quarantine, I am unable to work out the same... just running and doing as much as I can. I’ve found my body changing in ways I am very uncomfortable with. I’m waking up daily weighing myself, logging my food, and checking my Fitbit constantly. I recently started staring in the mirror more and despising the person who looks back.

175,EDPostRequests,1586945210,g1p5nn,"My whole life, I have had a good relationship with my mother. We were always close, and I felt like I could tell her anything. I had an amazing childhood with her, but I know her own childhood was difficult and as a result she is not close with any of her siblings and has a distant relationship with her own parents. I think she and my father made it their mission to ensure that my siblings and myself would not share any of her trauma, and they were successful. I love them both very much.

About 5 years ago, around the time I moved out of my parents' house, my mother began closing herself off to the world. It was very gradual, and I never really noticed her new behaviours since I went away for school and started my own new chapter, but it greatly affected my younger siblings and my father. She stopped going to any gatherings with extended family, stopped seeing her friends, took a leave of absence from her job, and began exercising for up to 3 hours a day. My mother was always a slim woman, but in the last few years she's lost what looks like 30 pounds and she has no fat whatsoever. If you compare her now with photos of her from 5 years ago, she looks seriously ill. She runs inside on a treadmill every single day, sometimes for up to 3 hours (she'll take breaks to stretch or lift weights), and she wears multiple layers when exercising - a long sleeved t-shirt, a vest, and a lightweight jacket overtop. She eats tiny, doll-sized portions at meals, and blames the quantity of her food on her heartburn and dietary issues. However, she will snack on candy and chips throughout the day.

A few weeks ago, I asked her what her diet looked like, and she told me to keep my opinions to myself because I did not have her dietary issues. She went to therapy for a few months last year, but after 8 sessions she claimed her therapist told her she didn't need to come anymore (which I don't even think is a thing therapists do). For a while I thought she might be making progress (she went out more, she travelled and ate at restaurants), but since COVID-19 has begun, my siblings and father have been struggling because she seems to be exactly where she was at the start.

I am worried about them, because they witness it every day and quarantine home life has become quite dark, and I'm worried about my mother who is not living a healthy lifestyle and is in complete denial over it. We have confronted my mother about it (and were met with outright denial and/or ""none of your business"" narrative), we have spoken to doctors, and we have independently met with therapists to discuss this, and the reality is she is not making any progress. Our last resort was to hold a family intervention or go to a family therapist, but COVID-19 has made that impossible (two of my siblings live in other cities, and my whole family is practicing physical distancing).

As I said in my intro, I'm at a loss. I think about this every day, and I feel completely helpless. I love my mother, but she is clearly dealing with mental illness and an ED. I do not know how to help her. My siblings and dad are struggling with it as well. Does anyone have any experience with this? Thank you.

So, to preface, I'm in a miserable home situation. My bf is long distance, so I can't see him, and I'm stuck in a house with my very controlling and strict parents. I'm absolutely miserable and so isolated, especially now with the quarantine situation (this is relevant).

About two weeks ago, I was binge eating a lot. This has been normal for me for years, I would go out and buy candy or cookies or junk food and eat it in my car because I knew I couldn't get junk food at home. (My parents are health freaks and the most ""junk food"" snack that we have are chocolate low-calorie protein bars and whole wheat pretzels). This was the norm for me and, for a while, I really struggled with self control.

All of the sudden, out of nowhere, I lost my appetite completely. The day after a regular-sized binge, I just wasn't hungry. I felt fine, and all I ate that day were two small pieces of food at dinner, then I went to sleep. I woke up the next morning feeling fine, even though I hadn't eaten. Since then (about a week ago) I've been eating very little. I've been feeling fine, but I noticed some changes in my attitude towards food. I've been wanting to lose weight for a while (I'm overweight, and I gained a lot of weight in the past year because I don't have very good self-control when it comes to food due to my parents forcing me to eat super healthy). I had a sort of ""no-no"" weight, that I would've absolutely lost it if I reached it. I could count on one hand how many pounds away I was from it, and this devastated me. This was about two months ago, and my weight stayed the same until a week ago. I went one day without eating less, and I was happy because I weighed myself and had lost weight. I have only been eating differently / less for about a week, but I've already lost a lot of weight. Because I'm overweight, my body is running on fat and energy I already have in my body, so I can't feel the pain of it, but I've begun to enjoy the feeling of restricting. I've started exercising a bit more (before this I was confined to my room and barely got out of bed), but that's helping me lose the weight faster. This wasn't just a change of attitude, though. I lost my physical sense of appetite. I'm no longer hungry and I'm losing weight fast. At first I thought I might have a stomach issue like worms or an infection, but nothing hurts and I feel fine.

Could this be an eating disorder? I've looked into anorexia and it fits what I'm doing but I don't think I need help because I do need to lose weight and I feel fine. I haven't told my parents about this but I don't consider this ""starving myself"" because I'm legitimately not hungry. I've tried all of the other ways to conventionally lose weight and this is the only thing that's helping me.

I have severe depression, could this just be another symptom of that? Appetite loss is a symptom of it, so should I talk to my therapist about me having an ED (I probably don't), or just change my antidepressants?

My weight constantly fluctuates by quite a bit every year, I lose about xx pounds and gain it back every 6-8 month. This happens because I will stop eating as much for weeks to months and then overcompensate and eat more. Last year in the fall it was my first semester in college and going through some personal stuff, and I lost about xx pounds in a couple weeks. I’ve never had a huge misconception about my body, thinking I was too fat or too skinny, I’ve always had ideals but none that I forced upon myself. But when I lost that weight, I really loved how my body looked and it made me reconsider if I was unhappy with my body before. I have since gained it back. And now I’m wishing I had that body back. My concern is, I understand realistically that restricting food is bad and my body my choice and I should love myself no matter what, but I was having this restricting and binging (im not sure that’s the right term sorry) since before I started looking at my body differently.

Long story short, my eating disorder has been up and down since I was about 16.

A few months ago I was in a super toxic and emotionally neglectful relationship and had also just lost my father. I lost so much weight. More than I ever have in my entire life.

I was bones. People knew it. My face was sunken in. I was light headed. So depressed if I ate a few bites I’d feel like I’d throw up.

Well now, I’ve gained back the weight. Hell, who knows it could be more than what I weighed before. I’m too scared to check the scale.

I feel disgusting now. But I also am embarrassed to say I felt a horrible sense of “pride” when I go so stupid skinny. I was like wow—I’m thin! Like that matters.

I don’t know what to think or how to feel right now. I don’t know who to turn to. I’ve been in therapy for years trying to improve my relationship with food.

I (25 y/o, female) had a severe eating disorder for two years. I was admitted (against my will at the time) to a hospital and I was very sick and practically inches from dying. I never really recovered mentally although I was “forced” to do therapy for half a year, then gave up and went back to work. Then a few months later I started to have severe binges and put on a lot of weight. After about 4 months of binging everyday I “learnt” to purge and instantly graduated to bulimia.

From that day I binged and purged everyday. My bulimia has been a living hell. It got so bad I had to leave my dream job because my disorder made me unable to function as a human being and took all my time and effort. I’m now at a (semi-low) healthy weight but I haven’t had a non-food related thought in two years nor a single day in half a year without binging and only a few without purging. UNTIL a week ago.

Suddenly, I just could like… not binge. I didn’t binge for the first day in half a year a week ago. Then my stupid brain thought “well, since I am now able to not binge, I wonder if I'm also able to… restrict?”. I found out that indeed I could. And I have been for a week. I don’t want to, but my stupid ED brain gets the biggest kick out of being able to, thinks it’s ""strength”. However, I never ever want to go back to anorexia but I just cannot seem to find balance.

The comments from others just reinforce the terrible things I say to myself. It's been like this since I was in elementary school, and 20-odd years later, I still haven't figured it out.

I lost a lot a few years ago but basically starved myself using keto/intermittent fasting as a cover for what was going on, so I looked great but was literally killing myself. But everyone said I was looking amazing and no one cared what was really going on.

Then I got sick and gained like half of it back.

I recently did a medically-supervised very low calorie program. I hated it. The group classes were the worst, people shamed me for things, like not being able to completely ignore what others say about me (I know I should be able to, it's just incredibly hard, and being told that I'm a loser for it...). They celebrated each other for their ability to not eat. It killed my soul having to sit through it every week.

Now I'm on another ""healthy eating"" program where they categorize foods as red/yellow/green. And the coach keeps telling me no more red foods. Like turkey chili and protein bars. And today, he told me to go back to the things I did when I was successful (aka starving myself) before. I tried to explain the situation, how I can't deal with restrictions in a healthy way and I need to learn to manage food wisely and in a healthy manner. No response.

I had another low last night. I ate sushi and then felt horribly guilty and 30 min later, found myself sticking my finger down my throat in the shower as I sobbed. I knew it was too late, the food was mostly gone. But I had to do something. 

I can't keep living like this. I have a therapist, she thinks I'm doing great, she's glad I'm not depressed anymore, life is good! When I've tried to be honest, no one will listen. I told my best friend about it and the response was just ""hey don't starve yourself"".

A ""friend"" told me yesterday that I'm embarrassing, pathetic, stupid, and going to die alone (I don't think we'll be friends anymore). And now that's all I can think about. I already am mostly alone, I'm too disgusting for society, and I lost most of my friends while I was sick.

Hey guys, so I (24F) have recently just quit abusing laxatives cold turkey. It was one of the toughest things I've done besides incorporating food back into my life. My parents had found out about the laxatives and confronted me, and I then spilled the beans to my boyfriend. He has been really supportive through this whole mess (my parents have not) and has really encouraged me to keep working out like usual and to continue eating (I'm on a tight diet of 1200-1350 calories a day). However, in the past 6 days since quitting, I've gained 10 lbs and I feel like I see every ounce of that weight on my body. Has anyone dealt with quitting laxatives before? Whenever I look up information on it, websites say that the weight gain is water weight and that it's just temporary. No one seems to talk about how long it takes to leave or how much of that ""water weight"" is real. I'm really struggling to let myself heal and just be happy with the fact that I made a big move to try and recover.

202,EDPostRequests,1587625573,g6i33m,"Hi everyone, I really need some advice, help or support. 

I am 18 years old (M) and have been in recovery for anorexia for a few years (I am healthy weight-wise, and while I am mentally a lot better, I am still not great).

My sister (16) has been developing an eating disorder over the past few months, and while there was originally doubt if she would actually ‘get’ one, it looks certain now. 
Admittedly, she has been focused on appearance for a long time, but the ED thoughts and behaviours seemed to happen very suddenly. She suddenly wanted to go on diets, lose weight and strictly eat ‘healthy’ food. She went from loving all foods (reguardless of calories or nutritional value) and eating whenever she was hungry, to cutting out anything ‘unhealthy’, starting to restrict and admittingly not eating when see was hungry - all in a matter of weeks. 
She is also in denial - “I love food too much to get an ED” and “I’ll never be like you” are her too favourite phrases at the moment. 

It has been so incredibly painful watching her go through almost the exact same initial stages I did. I have watched her mind and behaviour change just like I now know mine did. 
In a way this is eye-opening for me, as I am somewhat beginning to understand what it’s like to have a family member with an eating disorder, rather than be the sufferer. That said, I cannot deal with it logically, as I feel desperate to compete with it. 

A lot of how I feel is so incredibly selfish, but I can’t help it. I don’t know how to deal with my emotions and feelings surround the whole issue.  
It seriously feels like my worst nightmare is coming true. 
My sister was the most ‘normal’ eater in my family less than a year ago. She ate what she wanted, when she wanted - and loved food. (Looking back, I was the same as this before my ED) No one ever expected her to develop and eating disorder. And now it hurts so bad. 

I feel like I’m grieving - as if she is lost to me. Everything just feels so unreal. I feel like this can’t be happening. I want nothing more than for her to be normal again - for her not to have an ED. (Again, selfish I know)

More selfishly, I feel like her having an eating disorder is taking something away from me. I now see that it seriously did make me feel special - made me different. My ED has become so ingrained in my identity because I feel like without my mental illnesses I have no personality whatsoever. 

Even before this, I feel strong nostalgia for my ED almost everyday. I crave it. I want to be sick, and I want to be hospitalised and tube fed. (I never reached that point, so I don’t know if this is to do with never feeling like I was sick enough?) I want to my ED to be my whole life so I don’t have to worry about anything else. To me my life seems like it would be easier that way. 

Regardless, I eat normally everyday. Sometimes I have complete breakdowns and plan my ‘demise by relapse’, only to go back to eating an hour later when I swore not to. 

My sisters eating disorder is now a part of my life (and seems to be only just beginning) and I think about it 90% of the time - this is no exaggeration. My desire to relapse is even stronger and even though I’m still eating, I feel like I’m failing every time I do. 

What I’m trying to say is, I don’t know how to deal with this. Even when I’m not in the same house as my sister, I am always thinking about it. 

It’s also important that I say that my mother is trying to get help for my sister. Unfortunately, this does not really affect how I feel. I my mind the worst has already happened. Things will never be the same from now. She will never go back to who see was. 

Not entirely related to this problem in particular, by my sister is also abusive and often extremely rude and unpleasant.

She often refuses any help/treatment and will not corporate with doctors, psychiatrists. On top of this, she has used my ED and other mental illnesses as a weapon to bully and verbally attack me, and still does - she blames me for all her eating problems, or projects her behaviours onto me as if I did them.

I can’t help but feel like I have caused this problem. I have been unstable and battling with an ED for years, and my sister hates me for it. I am incredibly ashamed of myself. I have caused a problem that I now have no power over fixing, and it’s mentally exhausting and devastating.

I have also become paranoid that she has been ‘brainwashed’ by proana posts on tiktok, and all the ‘health’ posts on Instagram (which were a HUGE influence on my ED).

I can’t tell anybody because it’s embarrassing. Everyone I knew in my life never had a passion for food. Nobody craved it like I do so they wouldn’t understand. In fact, they all STRUGGLE to eat big amounts when it’s needed. And i’m over here eating giant amounts of food. You know what it’s like.. I am 18 and I have a binge eating disorder. Sometimes I starve myself, sometimes I purge my binges, sometimes I eat healthy but most of the time, I eat large amounts of food and sit in guilt. I don’t vomit because I am cautious for potential internal bleeding. I have many questions regarding my own problem. Mostly why. Why do I continue to damage my body knowing the consequences. I am a goddamn athlete and I still have this secret that my relationship with food is my demon. An embarrassing example of type of things I eat in binges; cake, candy, cookies, muffins, etc 

Eating this type of stuff makes me happy because it tastes good. Last week nobody I love remembered my birthday so I have literally been laying in bed crying, smoking weed and eating without thinking twice. But I always regret it in the near and far future. It’s not worth it but it feels like it in the moment. I honestly do not know how to fix this situation. Does anyone have advice for me?

To be clear, I love my bf very very much. He is very much a fit, athletic type who has trained for competitions for a very long time. As such, even though he doesn't train extensively anymore, he eats a huge amount of calories... Probably double or more of what I'm trying to eat.

This is super hard for me as someone who is overweight and struggled with an eating disorder for many many years. I am really trying hard to fix myself, to learn healthier eating habits with stricter boundaries. After a lot, and I mean A LOT, of research, I decided to try doing intermittent fasting in a 16:8 window so as not to be too restrictive, but also as I want to lose weight (due to chronic health problems as well) I'm cutting calories to around XXXXkcal a day. I do have one guilty food that I let myself indulge in but still within the calorie limit. (Don't come at me for IF or calorie counting, it happens to work for me and makes me feel good).

I know it's super unreasonable for me to expect my bf to eat any less and I would never dream of asking him to, it's just really hard sometimes when I get the urge to binge, and he's eating chips and I think, oh if he can do it why can't I? And it send me on a downwards spiral. Or on the other hand when my restrictive habits act up and I really don't want to eat, but I watch him eat and it makes me super bitter that 'I can't eat that way'. 

Especially now that I'm living with him and there's nowhere to run away to if I just wanna hide, or even if I'm in a bitter mood and I don't want to lash out and hurt him. He knows about my ED and has been super supportive in helping me manage it but still it's not something that he has ever experienced so I don't expect him to understand completely, especially since there are topics that I'm very sensitive about talking about.

Sometimes I just wanna break my head against a wall because I just want this to be over. I wanna be normal. I wanna feel normal in tight or revealing clothes. I don't wanna think about what I'm eating all the time. I don't wanna snap at my bf anytime he unwittingly makes a remark about how much or how little I've been eating.

214,EDPostRequests,1587462011,g5c8s2,"Some background, I used to be super overweight as a kid. I ate everything handed to me, no problem. Around the age of 13 I had (what I thought) was a piece of a popcorn kernel (the hard part) stuck in my throat, atleast it felt like it. I didn’t really care at that age and went on my way. A few days later after I was eating, it felt like something I was eating was stuck in my throat. This is what I can remember as my first panic attack, as my mom ended up calling an ambulance to come check me out but I could breathe and was fine. Eventually, we found out it seemed to be related to a fragrant clothing detergent, discontinued use and everything seems to go back to normal.

Fast forward about 8 years, this problem never really resurfaced from what I can remember. When I was like 21, I think, my long term first gf broke up with me for good. I was ok for a little bit, but then one night I just had this panicking feeling as I was eating something, as if I couldn’t swallow. And if I tried to swallow, my throat would almost constrict and I began to be afraid of choking. Eventually this totally blew up and I ended up in a psych ward because this event and other previous life events accumulated into me getting diagnosed with anxiety, ptsd, depression. 

That feeling came and went for a little bit. Eventually it would get ok, and I’d be able to eat normally. Then, it would decide to resurface, and I’d go back to eating soft foods or liquids because I was scared to swallow. I ended up losing a good amount of weight because of this. 

Basically, (4 years later), it’s been on and off like this. I know for sure it’s at least related to my anxiety, but would this be considered a ED? My therapist is well cued in on the whole situation, and has made the suggestion of maybe seeing a person more directed towards EDs but I never know what to say. 

I’ve came much farther lately (the past half a year or a little more) since I met the love of my life that really helped me progress, I ate like a “normal” person for a while and it was awesome. I know I can do it physically, but mentally, some times when I’m eating I’ll just get this panicking feeling when I swallow and if I let it consume me, it’s back to soft/liquid foods until I forget about it and try to inch back into hard/foods you have to chew.

To start I have always been slim. I felt really insecure about it my entire life since people comment on my skinniness a lot. At 15 I intentionally stopped eating because I was depressed and was hoping I would die because of it. I started getting treated for depression and anxiety at 16 and things got better.

Basically I have struggled with my weight my whole life, I was pretty overweight up the age of 19, then lost around a good amount of pounds by calorie counting and walking miles everyday, and since then I’ve been struggling to maintain that loss and repeatedly losing and gaining the same pounds, obsessing over food all the while. 

A couple of years ago and tried purging for the first time after I’d been out drinking and eaten a bunch of fast food. After that it became a thing I did pretty much every time I drank (because drinking was almost always followed by overeating) but never when I was sober. I honestly didn’t even worry about it that much. I thought when I was sober my inhibitions would always stop me, and it wouldn’t really matter if I did it once in a while after a night out. 

But then a couple of months ago I was getting just super frustrated with my constant food cravings, always trying to diet, always failing and eating too much. I made myself throw up sober for the first time, and found it surprisingly easy. I guess I found a knack for it or something. It’s been happening on a semi regular basis since then, whenever I feel like I’ve eaten too much. I’m really scared that I’ve established this as an option. I can’t help but think I’ve found the ‘cheat code’ that will get me out of hellish obsession I’ve had with food for my whole life. I know rationally that this isn’t true, but it’s like my brain is telling me it is. 

I still feel like this is a decision rather than a compulsion, I know I need to get out now before I get hooked. I need someone to tell me why I should stop. I know the health risks, but I can’t seem to get out of the ‘that won’t happen me’ mindset. I’m scared of myself, I hate that I started this. But at the same time, I find it so hard to control my weight and always have.

We are the same hight, and I know that she weighs about 11 lbs more than me, but she looks skinnier than me and it triggers me so much. She says she hates her weight and wants to lose some. Sometimes she will send me pictures of how flat her tummy is when she didn’t eat all day. And every time she sends me picture of what she eats, there is always so little food on her plate. We have a mutual friend. When she goes out with our friend, she eats so much. I know that from our mututal friend. But when she is with me, she eats NOTHING. She also doesn‘t send our mututal friend pictures of her body or weight or other things that are related to that topic. She only send things like this to me. I also asked other mutual friends and they always wonder why she would send me that because she never sends something like that to them...
Sometimes I wonder if she wants to trigger me on purpose? She nows that I struggle with eating. I think she struggles with eating too, but she denies it. However, I personally would NEVER send someone who I KNOW has/had an eating disorder content that could trigger them. 
It‘s not like she asks for help and advice but she will write something like „Omg I am so fat, I will lose weight by starving myself lol“. It triggers me! 
She is the biggest reason why I don’t want to gain weight and don’t eat anything at all when she is around..

3. I don’t know a single person whose tummy isn’t flat. It makes me feel ashamed because my tummy is already bloated after a sip of water! I just always look like I am pregnant.. 
My body type is a H or V shape (but without the big boobs :/) and tbh it makes me feel unfeminine. If I gain more weight, it wouldn’t look good, so I always try to maintain being underweight. I am so afraid of how I would look like if I gained 10 lbs? I know nobody with the same body shape as me. Everyone seems to have the perfect hourglass figure and some bigger or thinner than others, but everyones body looks good! :/

For many years I have a huge  problem with compulsive exercise. It is actually not really exercise but I ""have"" to do all kinds of things that involve physical activity throughout the entire day. It's something like ""physical-activity-OCD"" 

Walking the stairs x times carying x amount of weight. Cycling the same road (uphill) x times. Running back and forth in the garden x times. Cleaning the shower cabin x times. Altogether it can take up to 8 hours a day.

Because my ""exercise"" is so much coppeled to daily activities, it is impossible avoid my exercise routines being triggered all the time.
It's making me so angry and depressed, and I really need to get out to get my life back, but how?

For those of you that quit or greatly reduced compulsive exercise:

How much physical activity do you have in daily life after that?

Did you stop all exercise at once or gradually reduce exercise?

And what did you do instead of the time you would usually exercise?

When you're able to decide not to do a certain part of you're daily/weekly exercise, are you constantly afraid you still have to do it later that day/week? 

Did you simultaneously started eating more (as a part of anorexia recovery), did you ate the same amount or did you reduce your intake?

And at last, the question you never expected; what did it do to your weight?

If you experienced something like this it would be great if you could please give some answers or insight in your recovery. Only tell what you want to share of course.

231,EDPostRequests,1588404925,gc2i7i,"Hi guys. I’m glad that there is a group like this with people who can relate because sometimes I feel so ashamed and alone. Although I’m sorry that you all are going through this to, it’s comforting to know that there are people in the world that understand.

I’ve had an uncomfortable relationship with my body and food since I was about 12. I then became a vegetarian- I thought vegetarians were skinny. I hid my motivations from my mom. I switched schools when I was 13 and was bullied for having a big nose, but people did comment on how small I was and I guess I clung to that.

At 13 I started binging and purging. My mom caught me once, and almost physically hurt me, but my brother stopped her and I ran out of the house. The school nurse found out and told my mom that she needed to take me to get help. My mom took me to a center, they said I should do outpatient treatment, and my mom took me to a pizza buffet right after that. And she said to me, you don’t really need help, do you? And I said no, I’ll be fine.

I wish she got me help. I wish she didn’t see it as a stain on her parenting. I struggled in silence for 3 more years and then met a group of people who I felt so comfortable around that I felt like I no longer wanted to be bulimic. I was so happy. I felt accepted. I felt loved. I thought my whole life changed, and it pretty much did.

Now I’m 25. I work in the tattoo industry and from the moment I walked into it, I’ve felt that I needed to be pretty, or hot, or else no one would like me. I feel like everyone in this industry feels the need to act like superstars. I got into this industry because I love art, and wanted to do it forever. I wanted to make art and saw tattooing as the way to go.

But it has been so hard. I never feel accepted. I always feel too short, to unattractive, to bubbly, to quiet, to soft, not edgy. Too kind.

I’ve been struggling so much lately. I realize that I need help. I need it really really bad. I’m not underweight. I’m just on the border and try to remain there. But it hurts my soul. I have an internal struggle with myself on a weekly basis about whether or not I should just eat what I want, instead of what I think I need.

It’s a fight. It’s always a fight. And it’s inside of me.

I just wish it was simple. I wish it wasn’t eat something you want and feel guilty, or eat something you think you need, and feel guilty for restricting.

I’ve come to the place where I just feel guilty either way.

I’m tired of feeling like I need to be beautiful. I want to just believe that I am, and have people in my life that love me for me, and don’t care about my outsides. However I fear that most of the people in my life like me for what I look like- who I’ve tried to be. Because I look like them. I even feel like my family would judge me if I gained weight. I feel scared.

I’ve been lurking on this subreddit trying to find any advice about how to help my sister (18F). She recently told me about her disordered eating this past year as she started her freshman year of college. Since COVID, she’s had to move in with me (24F) because our mom is incredibly toxic. My sister experienced panic attacks every night and a lot of eating triggers when living with her. I noticed that when me or my sister are upset, my moms way of helping us making us eat food (literally holding food up to our mouths while we’re crying). My mom constantly makes comments about my sister not eating because she’s too “health-conscious” and “skinny enough.” She ended up coming to live with me until quarantine is over.

My sister and I have always been really close, but we have a more mom-daughter relationship. She’s getting older so it’s changing as she becomes an adult. I’m the one in the family who’s known as the “screw-up” because of my own mental health struggles, PTSD stemming from a sexual assault. I think it’s unspoken that my family has always focused on my issues. My sister recently said to me she’s always felt like the “forgotten child.” 

So, for the first time, I want to show my sister that she matters too and that it’s okay that she’s struggling. I’m here for her no matter what but I really don’t know how to be. I’m a social worker so I’ve always thought that I know how to address a crisis. But Im realizing I don’t have much experience with eating disorders. I’m feeling lost when it comes to recognizing triggers. I let her shop for all of her own food and I try to be as normal as possible about our meals. Our schedules are really different (she’s a morning person, I’m a night person), and she’s mentioned that it’s affecting her eating schedule. It’s just really hard to see her break down when she ate cookies that I brought home when my friend made them for us, or crying because she couldn’t turn down the tacos I offered when my bf and I were going to get some. She also mentions it’s hard to look in the mirror. I don’t want to overdo it by being too helpful (she has told me that I can be overbearing when I try to help—I’m working on new boundaries with her. I’m scared accidentally treat her weird or remind her about her ED too much. She’s in counseling (over zoom) every week so she’s getting all the professional help she’s willing to right now.

233,EDPostRequests,1588404575,gc2fyu,"Hi all. 29 yo M here. At age 24 I decided to get into better shape and started working out obsessively while aggressively cutting calories. It worked at first but then I found myself unable to stop. Pretty soon I found myself in the hospital with multi-organ failure and severe endocrine abnormalities (thyroid and testosterone).

I have gained some of the weight back and am a much more healthy weight, but still have low thyroid and testosterone tests due to low body fat and high stress from working out. Sadly, I can't stop obsessing about food and meticulously planning out every meal. As soon as I finish breakfast my mind fixates on what I'm going to eat for lunch, and how to keep myself entertained until that time. If something disrupts my planned meals and I end up eating more calories than I expected I immediately get angry with any/everyone around me. Additionally, if I have a lazy day or don't work out I restrict the amount I eat even more.

I've made several attempts to use calorie counters in a good way, to force myself to eat a certain number of calories daily, but I found this only makes me fixate on food more and causes me to secretly make sure that I always stop at that number of calories and never go higher. This is a long ramble, but I'm looking for any help for making food a happy and not a stressful part of my life. I'm sick of it ruining my mood and my relationships. The meal planning anxiety and anger I feel when I don't stick to the plan has hurt those around me and has changed who I seem to be to my friends.

I need help navigating this weird new “recovery” space and finding a healthy relationship with exercise and food.

I’ve always felt I was addicted to food and really struggled to say no or stop myself from eating. I’m considered very overweight currently, however there have been times I wasn’t, and when I went to eating disorder group I think I secretly thought I’d end up losing weight as I’d be held accountable for what I ate.

I do believe I am a manipulative person with “rules” I’m given and I think I used the “eating high energy foods daily” to my advantage and ate a lot of good and gained a good chunk of weight again, even though I was obese to start with.

I’ve since some CBT for body satisfaction and I’m trying to find the middle ground of eating healthy but eating enough and trying to lose weight/get stronger while trying not to flare up my symptoms. Over the years these have been: restriction, purging, laxative teas, extremely restrictive diets and also sometimes even exercise.

I’ve been struggling with this since I was 15 and I’m 25 now and I know body image and self worth have been a problem for me since even before then, and for as long as I can remember.

Recently, my boyfriend and I have been working out during my days I work from home and I’m trying to find the balance between moving my body and “I have to workout to lose weight”. Today it’s raining and I didn’t want to go on our usual Thursday jog, but I’m left feeling VERY guilty that I didn’t go. And it’s not that I feel bad for him.

I'm in my 20s, and I've never been diagnosed, but I'd like to ask my therapist for help on getting diagnosed. I know I've probably had it in the past, and I know I'm probably relapsing right now.

I'm overweight, and that's something that's been used against me my entire life (family, ex-friends, ex-crushes). I wasn't even allowed to seek therapy before I moved out on my own. I don't even know if my family knows what they've done to me, as I've never brought it up to them.

TDLR: I know how to control my bulimia in quarantine but people posting on social media about 'body positive' things is triggering me.

I've (25F) been suffering with bulimia on and off since I was about 14 years old. I'm able to control it quite well in my normal day-to-day life; I've been vegan for about 6 months which has helped and generally I do a lot of exercise which stops me from feeling guilty about eating. I have been feeling generally good about myself in recent months and haven't felt the need to purge for a while. However, since the UK has been in lockdown and I havent been able to access the gym and play my team sport, so I, like many others I'm sure, have been struggling to prevent myself from binging/purging. 

I've tried to manage this by ensuring I do daily exercise, whether that's a run, cycle or just a home work out. I'm also in charge of shopping for myself and my flatmate (who is high risk), so ensure I buy healthy foods and no snacks, I try to eat my meals at specific times so that I don't end up overeating and feeling guilty. Generally speaking, I have my bulimia under control.

However, when I'm on social media I keep on seeing people post about how we shouldn't feel guilty for eating or putting on weight whilst we are in lockdown and this just completely triggers me. I know they mean well and are just trying to help, but the thing is no I can't eat what I want and I do feel guilty about putting on weight? They send me into such a spiral of feeling shit and anxious and make me want to eat loads which results in me making myself sick.

I completely cut out certain food groups, I've even missed my period for a couple of months before because of this, but I was so skinny and perfect and I felt in control. That was about a little more than a year ago. Then one day I decided to take a bite out of a donut, it was all downhill from there. I thought I could handle it, that somehow I learned balance and moderation. I just kept eating and eating all the bad foods you could think of for months straight. I gained all my weight back and more. It sent me in a horrible depression, I felt out of control, which I absolutely hate. I felt fat and gross. It's like I couldn't stop and no matter how much I ate I wasn't satisfied. It was like this mental hunger, like I deprived myself sooooooo much because I did. 

Here's the thing that really stresses me out. I love being on the keto diet but it is so restrictive. It does wonders for my diabetes (type 1) so I'm at such a loss here. I don't know what to do. When I TRY to eat a balanced diet, it never works. It's like I physically cannot do it. For me when it comes to things, I either do it all the way or no way at all, there is no balance, just a black and white view. So when I eat these 'bad foods' it's like I can't eat healthy because what's the point? I'm eating shit anyways, I'll get fat. When I'm eating keto, everything feels in control and I am in control but I feel like that can easily slip away from me any moment. This is gonna happen again and I know it. I'll lose a lot of weight again then think I learned moderation somehow, take a bite out of a donut or something and then get even worse. You do not know how incredibly hard it was to get back on the keto. I had to force myself. I love it but hate it at the same time. My blood sugars on a normal diet are never as good as they are on keto. On a normal diet, I have tried to eat healthy, it goes well at the beginning of the day with oatmeal and fruits but then I feel like if I ate that stuff, I might as well eat processed junk. 

There was even a time in my life where I thought fruits made you fat. Keto definitely made me have an even worse outlook on carbs, even 'healthy carbs'. I'm not trying to bash keto because it has helped me so much but it has also damaged me. 

I do not know what to do. This is so overwhelming. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. There is no balance with me, not even with food. I feel like there is no hope. I never thought I'd have such a disgusting relationship with food. This is making me severely depressed.

sorry for bad formatting, im on mobile

basically, couple years ago when i was about 12 in 6-7th grade i was friends with these 2 girls (still am, have since forever). i dont really remember how it all started, but one of them was struggling with their weight and food a lot. she would hide food, exersize a bunch, eat less than exersizing all of that. she also self harmed herself a lot. 

we would always be there to talk to her, but very soon it started to seem almost contagious. i started doing the same thing. not just because she was doing it, but i have always felt overweight and just hated my body ever since i was little. (i dont blame her one bit for this at all, it was not her fault, it was no ones) it started escalating really quickly and eventually her parents found out everything and she got sent inpatient. they were close to finding out what i was doing too but they didnt. 

she was there for six months instead of school. 
i would make myself throw up aswell, exersize all the time, eat very little food with low calories. but eventually i just... like stopped. not stopped cold turkey but my “symptoms” started getting less and less of a problem. our other friend was struggling with this but eventually she admitted she was only doing it because we were doing it (that still didn’t invalidate her insecurities in my opinion) 

anyways, she was diagnosed with anorexia and other various mental health issues, and i was pretty much ignored mental health wise by my parents because my brother was having a lot of issues with school. i felt awful. i still feel so, so awful everytime i think about it. she is the best person i know in every single way possible. 

the reason im posting this is because i have such a lack of closure. i cant look at myself. i shower with the light off, i change clothes only when necessary, i cant stand being in my body. it feels like agony. but i hate myself for hating myself because i dont do anything about it. i barely ever got underweight, my metabolism and genes destine me to be overweight. no matter what i do, nothing changes. 

TW: Self harm, suicidal thoughts


&gt;!now, years later, im addicted to self harm and i cant look at myself and i have a bad relationship with food but i dont fucking do anything about it. i want to kill myself. i have no self worth and all i want to do is silence my thoughts. i feel so fucking depressed.!&lt;

back to having lack of closure, im only diagnosed with anxiety and adhd. dont take this the wrong way: i dont want any mental health issues at all, i feel shitty enough. but i want an explanation. i never talk to my parents abojt how i feel, but i cant get out of bed and im so fucking tired and everythings foggy. i feel useless and weak. i cant stand being alive. 

i never got diagnosed with anything other than anxiety and adhd because thats all i have ever talked about with my mom, she cant handle anything else. shes so stressed out all the time because we have to move soon and we dont have a place anywhere. she has so much on her mind i couldnt possibly burden her with this. i have nowhere to turn to. 

i just dont know what to do. i hate myself and my image but i dont have the motivation to starve myself anymore. i feel fake..

most of the time, whatever I eat or whatever the amount, I feel really guilty about eating. the only reason I think that it hasn't gotten bad is because ever since I was a kid I've had to go through therapy and one of the main things was just taking care of yourself even tho you feel like absolute shit and that kind of overrides the instinct not to eat or to punish myself for eating, because I just keep telling myself that it's my mean brain goblin talking and that I need to focus on the nice goblin (yes, I'm almost an adult but I still use that type of imagery because it's easier to tell someone/something to fuck off than telling myself to do so haha)

Im 21 and I'm living with my parents now since I can't be on campus during quarantine, so my mom is making food.

I asked her nicely to not make food for me when she makes stuff like that but then she gets mad at me. She keeps saying ""don't eat it then"" but she doesn't understand how hard it is for me to control myself is she sets a plate of unhealthy food out for me. When she doesnt make food for me, I eat healthy and don't binge or purge. 

I've been getting problems with my teeth and got a few mouth ulcers, which hurts very bad. I'm really scared telling my dad about this because I'm scared he'll get because he payed lots for my dental bills in the past, which is not bulimia related but I'm scared he'll think it is.

253,EDPostRequests,1588127714,ga178g,"Hi all,

I’m looking for some advice on how to help my sister with an ED. I’m her younger brother and I myself struggled with anorexia when I was in high school, but thankfully have recovered and have been healthy (for the most part) for nearly 6 years. 

She is struggling with similar issues, and has for several years on and off, but I’ve learned that what may have helped me isn’t necessarily going to work for her. I recently realized that there are many different things that can go on mentally with these disorders, and each case can be very different.

Here’s the situation... my sister is underweight, and continuing to lose weight. One amazing step she took with our families support is to seek treatment. She was referred for inpatient care, and is awaiting the call to go. Right now, however, with COVID-19, the hospital will not be allowing visitors. She also read that in treatment they control your cell phone use and computer use, and monitor eating. This is really stressful for her, because she needs support from her s/o and family during treatment. 

She told me if they call her and no visitors are allowed, she will decline treatment. I know this is selfish of me, but seeing her go through this is really hard for me. I’ve been through similar issues and know the pain, but her case seems to be much more intense/severe than mine was. 

She often poses certain questions to me and my mom, like “do I look sick, or like I’m just skinny?”. My mom often wants to be honest, and tell her she looks an unhealthy weight. I, however, know the harm that could be caused by answering this question. I one time broke and told her the honest truth as lightly as I could, but regret it to this day.

I just don’t know what to do. I worry, and hurt for her, because she doesn’t realize how beautiful she truly is and this is a root of the issue. She often compares herself to her boyfriend’s exes, asking me who is thinner. How can I be supportive and an outlet for her to converse about how she’s feeling, without saying anything that could be harmful to her? I want to help her in every way I can, but it’s hard. I struggle with PTSD myself, so I’m going through my own battle right now, but her physical health is starting to deteriorate so I’m trying to set my issues aside. 

Side note: something I do is if we are in a drive-thru and she wants something like “1 hash brown” at McDonalds, I order her something else with it, like chicken nuggets. Is this harmful for me to do? I do it with good intentions, but after reading some comments and posts on here, maybe it’s harmful?

A little about me: I’m a female college student, who is now home, of course (probably a good thing though) So starting in February, I decided I needed to lose some weight. I wasn’t incredibly overweight, but I was technically overweight, and I knew I’d feel better physically if I lost a few pounds. So, basically, on February 1st, I started my diet. The first week, I stayed in a pretty healthy calorie deficit. It’s hard to say how much I was losing from exercise since the campus is so big and we walk a lot, but I think I was still fine. But then, after that week, I started to restrict myself A LOT, like I would eat a piece of grilled chicken and maybe a piece of fruit, along with snacking on some unsalted almonds throughout the day, maybe a few other handfuls of food. But that’s basically all I ate. There were a few days from that time until about 4 days ago (when I finally broke down and told my mom what was happening) where I did eat a few, “normal” meals. Like restaurant meals. But other than that, I was eating a pretty small amount. I didn’t even mean to restrict myself that much, but I just didn’t feel hungry. Anyways, I decided to make the change when I realized I was super irritated all the time and I couldn’t stop it. I was being rude to my parents, because I was hangry basically.

Hi! I wasn't sure where to post this, but I thought some people on this thread might have some experience that they could lend. It also relates to my previous eating disorders.

I am a 23 year old cis female and I had regular periods from the age of 12. I went on the birth control pill Yasmin aged 16, and I stayed on it until August 2019 (so, give or take 6-7 years). During this time I struggled with anorexia, bulimia, drug use, and exercise addiction. This was worst between the ages of 19-21. However, I never went below a relatively ok BMI (just under the healthy range, but only for about 1 year), and never needed hospitalisation or treatment beyond seeing a therapist a few times a week and getting anti-depressants. 

For the most part, my 'periods' (withdrawal bleeds) were regular while on the pill, though they did tend to dry up during times when I was especially restrictive/doing lots of cardio OR when I had exams.

I am doing better now and my weight has been at a stable BMI (the low end of the healthy spectrum) for about 2 years. During this time I have been exercising mindfully for a few times a week and eating a very high amount of calories for a woman (this is not just me saying this, I have been told I can EAT) - well over the RDA for female calorie consumption! I was hoping that when I came off the pill that my periods would return within 3 months, but they never did. This was at the end of last year.

5 months after coming off the pill I had a tiny (and I mean small) bleed which was more of just a brownish discharge, and some stomach cramps which lasted for one evening in January. Since then, nothing.

It has now been 8 months since coming off the pill. I have seen multiple doctors, had blood tests and an ultrasound scan and have ruled out thyroid problems, early menopause, PCOS, and all the usual suspects. 

Apart from the missing period I am in the peak of health. I do exercise most days, but I enjoy it immensely and it's lots of slow mindful movement mixed in with some comfortable paced running and yoga. The doctors do not seem to be worried.

My question is - has anybody had this problem coming off the pill? I have received mixed messages from doctors and female friends. Some people say it's abnormal for the period to not come back after 3 months, some have told me it could be up to a year. Obviously, given my history with eating disorders and exercise, I am wondering whether it could be Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (that is the medical term for lost period from over exercising and under eating/low body fat). But how is this possible when I eat as much as I do and my BMI is within the healthy range?

I can't think of any friends or family I would feel comfortable sharing these thoughts with, because they make me feel incredibly superficial. 

I had anorexia throughout college, and have felt I mostly recovered over the couple of years. I have been dating my new boyfriend for a few months now and this new relationship has been a huge, positive turning point for my body image, but with quarantine for Covid-19 bringing so much stress and limited options for food and exercise, I've been feeling increasingly anxious.

A few nights ago, I ended up stumbling across a picture of my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend and was shocked to see what she looked like. My boyfriend is incredibly fit, and our relationship revolves around fitness, but his ex is considerably overweight. Seeing this image became a horrible trigger for me and I can't think about anything else now. I took this as a sign that I was wrong, and that I am also overweight. Since seeing that photo, I haven't been able to look at him, and I do not view him as attractive anymore. I feel like all of the positivity I've gained from his perception of my body completely vanished the moment I saw pictures of his ex.  This feels like the worst step backwards I have taken in years of recovery, and I can't do anything but sob and hate how this could ruin my first happy, serious relationship. I have lost a couple of serious relationships in the past due to my negative perceptions of my body, and because i project my insecurities onto those I date and no longer find them attractive either. 

My boyfriend and I have always had the greatest, most open communication, but this doesn't feel like something I could ever say to him.

Hello!

Since we’ve been in quarantine I’ve been alone with my thoughts for long periods of time and this has led me to self reflect. I’ve started to come to the conclusion that I might be suffering from an eating disorder and wondering if I should seek help? 

(I know that the internet can’t diagnose me, but right now with the quarantine I can’t go see anyone and my insurance doesn’t pay for virtual therapy, so I was hoping this community would be able to at least point me in the right direction or give me advice?)

I’ve been dieting since probably 10 or 11, my family encouraged it as they were also always dieting to lose weight and they thought of it as a “healthy lifestyle” for me. I’m in my early 20’s and my body has started to settle into its womanly form, so a lot of these habits I do have begun to intensify over the past year or so:

- Over the years I’ve come to have a lot of anxiety surrounding food. After I eat I always have a moment of contemplation where I go through a check list in my head to determine whether or not I should feel bad (I always do anyways).

1. How many calories?
2. How many carbs?
3. How much of it did I eat? 
4. How soon was this meal to my previous meal? 
5. How many more times can to eat after this?

It hit me that I go through this with every single thing I eat, whether it be a snack or a meal. It’s such a ritual that I hadn’t even noticed I’d been doing it for years. I always brushed it off as being in a “healthy mindset”.

- Multiple times in my life I’ve gone through these periods of what I called “Mirror Detoxing”. This is where I would refuse to look at a mirror for weeks if not months at a time. I implemented this because seeing myself in the mirror was interfering with my life. I would look into a mirror at myself and either become filled with dread at what I saw or stand there for 20-45 minutes messing with my hair and my clothes. There were times that I would get in trouble at school or at work for being away for too long. 

- I obsess over thin people’s bodies. I don’t really know how to explain this but if I see a thin woman whether it be in real life, social media or in entertainment media, I become entranced almost. I can’t stop looking at all the things I want that they have, to the point where I sometimes will cry after watching a television show or seeing a model on Instagram. 

- Lastly, I have a really hard time doing my hobbies or feeling comfortable doing them because I get into this mindset that the only way I could reach my potential in these hobbies is if I was thin. I know it sounds weird, but it’s like I feel held back by my body and the only way for me and others to see my talent, I have to become thin.

I go through cycles of being really “good” and eating x amount of calories and only healthy foods. Then I break and end up binging. To make up for this I restrict even more. Before I binge normally all I can think about what I’m going to eat next and I don’t even know that I eat enough food for it to be considered binging but I feel like I lose control. I know long term this cycle of eating and thinking probably leads to the opposite of my goals. I want to be a healthy weight and I want to be fit, but I’m scared that if I allow myself to stop calorie counting and restricting I’m just going to binge all the time and become obese. I’ve been trying to eat a normal amount of calories with super healthy foods lately and have a cheat day in the week where I allow myself to eat super unhealthy foods that I crave but I always get super hot panicky about what I eat on this day.

I like a lot of different types of snacks healthy and un healthy but meals are so hard. Every day 3x a day its a fight about what i will eat bc everything my parents make i dont like. When they ask me what i will eat i cant come up with anything. Ive tried to look up recipes but theres always something in it i dont like and its not like a small thing that can be substituted its always the main part of the meal. But every day my parents get so mad at me and i dont blame them but its even more frustrating on me bc a lot of the time i go w/o eating meals just snacks.

How might one find feelings before a binge eating crisis? What does it feel like in the body?

I’m bulimic. My therapist suggested that when I have an eating  craving/hijack, I try explore those feelings for a few seconds (3-12s)  before grounding myself using techniques like the butterfly hug. This is  called desensitization. 

Problem is I have trouble finding those feelings. 

Here are the scenarios that end up in bulimia crisis’: 

1. **Gradual:** I’m bored or restless (usually linked to  procrastinating on tasks I don’t want to do, which are most things in  life) so I get a (sweet) snack to distract myself, then have a bit more,  then a bit more, and before I know it it’s: “I’ve eaten too much,  F-this I might as well go all in an purge after.”  
 

2. **Planned:** I’m out an about and a craving starts to  build up but because of people “watching”or because I won’t able to go  purge I’ll resist, however, I’m itching to get home and be alone to  ‘relief’ myself. By the time I do, I go strait into a crisis.  

3. **Hijack:** When I resist a crisis or had multiple  crisis in the day, I get food craving ‘hijacks’ where I feel like an  addict and there’s nothing stopping me. I can’t think and the one and  only mission is to relief myself asap. 

Background: 

\* I’ve been struggling with eating disorders for 20+ years and thanks to  years of psychoanalysis have a good idea about its roots (lack of  self-actualization, attachment to mother, etc.). 

\* Problem is knowing this isn’t helping me deal with my ED.

\* That’s probably because I’m numb and don’t feel my feelings. 

\* When I do have feelings they are usually negative and extreme (and  related to situations where my ‘ideal’ identity is threatened or fear of  abandonment from a partner, my father wasn’t in my life), in these  situations I go into food deprivation mode (anorexia). 

\* Life feels like a chore. I don’t know what it’s like to do things for  fun or out of love anymore.",Request: How might one find feelings before a binge eating crisis?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/g8xug0/request_how_might_one_find_feelings_before_a/,1588002841,27-04-20 4:54
265,EDPostRequests,1587980896,g8xrv9,"My girlfriend is 24 and has had bulimia since approximately 16/17 years old. She purges after almost every meal, and binges and purges very often. 

I've recently learnt about her bulimia and admittidly knew very little about the condition and didn't realise how serious it was until I started doing my own research.

I've started reading horror stories of what can happen to the body due to bulimia, such as burst blood vessels in the eye, eroded teeth enamal (which she has), heart attacks, and torn stomachs. I'm absolutely terrified I'm going to find her collapsed over the toilet bowel one of these days. So, I try to talk about it with her and try to talk her into getting professional help. I myself live with OCD, and after getting Cognative Behavioural Therapy I find living with my condition much eaiser, so I know how valuable getting professional help can be. Her response is that she's tried to before and had a bad experience. Basically the GP was dismissive and said there's better ways to lose weight. Obviously the completly wrong thing to say to someone suffering from bulimia.

What worries me further is that she seems to have normalised her bulimia. Throwing up after a nice and healthy meal is completely normal and appears to not be distressing to her. So is binging and then going to purge. She assures me this is just the way it is and there's no need to worry. It's just what she does, and it's part of her. It's just routine for her, nothing unusual and nothing I need to be concerned about. But of course, I am, and it's beginning to really affect me. 

I feel like I'm going to explode. I feel angry, upset, scared, sympathetic, powerless, all at the same time because I love this girl and I see her destroying herself right in front of me yet she acts as if it's a normal daily act.

So my question is. How do I help my girlfriend when she has normalised the unhealthy behaviours of her condition to the point that she doesn't think she needs help?

Since then I managed to let go a bit because my scale broke (I still think that saved me) but in the quarantine I'm finding it a lot harder. I have gained weight since then as I was 13 and now my curves set in, so I went from low side of healthy weight to almost overweight. In quarantine I have been baking more so my parents made a comment about the calories, and that really set me off down the wrong path. Since we still don't have a scale I am terrified of being overweight, as I have a family history of diabetes and my parents have shamed anyone who is obese since I was little. All the triggering things I used to do two years ago are around me, and for some reason it is so tempting to fall back into that. I've been trying to focus on exercise for wellness and body positivity but the fear of the stupid BMI score is really getting me down. I don't know what I weighed last so I have a strong urge to just find a scale somewhere but I know that would make me iller.

267,EDPostRequests,1587922272,g8igxf,"To say I developed an eating disorder at 13 would be foolish, because I have always had an unhealthy relationship with food and my body. As a young child, I was very overweight . I would hide and eat, so my mother wouldn’t be angry with me. She would send me to school without a meal, so I would binge heavily at my grandma’s at the end of the day. At 13, I was put on a diet and my obsession snowballed from pivotal decision. My lowest weight was severely underweight— I’ve been through multiple admissions to treatment, suicide attempts, ECT treatments, medications, lost opportunities, etc.

I’m now 31 and am no better. I am ashamed.

There is some good in my life. I have a daughter and stepdaughter. I have a home. I have a job I enjoy.

But I can’t live with myself. I hate myself so wholly and entirely. It consumes my every day and night. Food is the enemy and I am the enemy—nothing has yet to convince me otherwise. I wish I could shed my skin and be someone else. I wish I could disappear.

The depression and anxiety are tiresome. I ache, my teeth are damaged, my hair and nails are dry and brittle. I have no interests, hobbies or dreams. I have a degree in art but I can’t even remember when I did so much as doodle. I can’t focus on books or TV. And, to make it worse, the ECT has erased many valuable memories from my mind.

All that consumes my mind is thoughts of how to lose weight. Or to not gain weight. Thoughts of cutting off fatty pieces of my body or getting surgery. Taking laxatives or diuretics. What I look like in whatever outfit, what my makeup looks like or hair.

I step on and off the scale 100 times a day. I’ve seen nutritionists, I know all of the correct information. I’ve spoken to doctors. But, to me, they are the irrational ones.

I’m so tired of fighting all the time. Obviously, this isn’t the only negative thing that has happened in my life. I’ve had the bullying, the divorced parents, parent dying, etc. But the disorder is destroying me. It’s my coping mechanism, it is my life. I can’t stand my appearance, I can’t stand not being normal. And no one can (or no one knows how) to help.

268,EDPostRequests,1587917851,g8h3zw,"Hi guys.

It's less than a month I have been struggling with AN, trying self recovery and then finishing in a loop of b/p cycle, but I can say how much this experience changed me.

My self esteem has never been that low like last week, I felt disgusting. But after 3 days free from binge, eating regularly every like 3 hrs something I like (not necessarily healthy or unhealthy), I can say it got much better. It was scary to go from extreme control to extreme uncontrol, and I hope that if someone is struggling with this, they can reach out for help and get out of this vicious cycle.

What helped me so much in these 3 days was finding the youtube channel of this amazing dude called ErikTheElectric. He's recovered from anorexia to be a former competitive eater and powerlifter. Even if competitive eating for me it's not a thing, (I get full after 20g of muesli with a yogurt lol) I can say that his experience with food and sport it's really mind blowing. He lost so much weight when he was young, he was super skinny, had relapses (everything is on his channel), and he arrived now to have such a free relationship with food that nothing scares him. I'm so so amazed by him, and it's inspiring for me too.

I always have been on the fit world, but in the last months I definitely over exercised and restricted to the limit of the impossible; from here, extreme hunger and purging. Seeing someone like him, free to eat whatever he wanted and being able to mantain his shape, was really an eye opener for me. Maybe this is ""normal"", but for me, it's still something that I struggle with.

Am I still scared to be overweight? Yeah. Even if my clothes fit the same, I feel bloated every day even more by eating, but I'm not letting the ED ruin anymore my life. I choose to forgive myself and who caused me all this self hate, because I know I don't deserve this.

I’m curious to know the struggles of those who don’t binge on any junk food at all, but actually struggle with eating too much fruit, veggies, meat, and other whole foods. By “junk food“ I’m talking about anything that’s processed, manufactured, or has additives or chemicals in it. I know that there are lots of things that claim to be “healthy“ but if you look on the label most of them have chemicals and sugar in them which could also make them addictive.

For example, does anyone binge on too much broccoli/cauliflower, too much bacon, too much meat, too much fruit? 

I know that these types of foods are much lower in calories, which actually makes it easier to over eat on them and stuff yourself because psychologically your brain will tell you that you won’t gain as much weight as you would with the more calorie dense food like pizza, burgers, potato chips, etc.

I think that I have an addiction to unhealthy foods (mostly sugar but sometimes things like chips). Ever since I was little, I would steal food from the pantry. This stealing made me belive that the real problem I have was stealing but then I thought about it a little more.


I realized that if I was an adult and could go to the store and buy these foods, I would and I wouldn't steal. Problem is, I know I would also buy them in excess (Say two packs of Oreos) and I would eat them all in a short amount of time, guilty at the amount I am consuming. 


The two problems I can see coming from this is 1. I could run out of money quickly from wasting it all on junk food or 2. I could grow unhealthy and develop a disease. 


I don't know if this is an eating disorder for a few reasons. I have told my dad about my problem and he said he struggles with the same thing but for him, he uses food as an emotional escape from life when things have him down. He says that is probably what it is for me but I don't think it is. When I take the food, it's not because I feel down. I just want it and it tastes good and I feel I have no control not to. 


I am also a pretty thin person and I have stayed at the same healthy weight for years. So it is hard for me because I am neither overweight nor underweight because of it. I also do not eat much in general. I think that comes mostly from pickiness and/or laziness (I'll snack alot throughout the day but I don't really eat big meals. My mom says it can possibly be an eating disorder because I don't eat that much usually but it is the times when I feel I have no control and I just NEED the junk food so much that I'm wiling to steal it that I'm worried about) 


I have tried stopping. I have tried saying to myself ""Okay, stealing this food is wrong. Just don't do it."" and sometimes that works but then the food Is all I can think about until I finally give in and steal it and binge it. 


I guess there is just this feeling of ""Never enough"". No matter how many cookies I have, I would always want more and I would always eat them in large quantities.

She also raised some red flags in my mind regarding EDs like for example she did a school project on them. However, she never visibly had any drastic weight loss, and she had mostly healthy eating habits, although she did eat less than most people (me and my sister both admittedly probably do not eat as much as we should, we have about 2 meals a day.)

This afternoon my sister, my dad and I were going somewhere and as we were walking my dad told me I was ""too skinny"" and I ""needed to put some weight on my bones"" (I have recently lost weight due to taking medications that suppress my appetite, and my parents have expressed concern over it). He then went on to compare my legs to my sister's, saying hers were ""healthier looking."" She immediately took offense and started calling herself ""the fat sister."" My dad said ""I didn't say you're the fat sister, I said you're the fatter sister."" I could tell this was his idea of a joke but it was a really fucked up thing to way regardless.

So later today at dinner my sister was giving my dad attitude, they start arguing, long story short she brings back up the ""fat sister"" thing and he started defending himself. I went off on him for being insensitive and he said my sister and I were lying and called us psychos. My sister was very hurt and so was I because of the way he was acting. He pulls the ""I love you and I do everything for you"" rather than apologizing and admitting his fault. It got pretty bad and he ended up leaving the house.

Anyway. I checked up on my sister after my dad left and she said ""I'm never eating again"" and I really feel like it's not her being dramatic. I told her not to go down a bad road because of a tasteless remark my stupid father made. I feel so awful that my dad would say something so triggering to her, especially because it was in comparison to my body. I am so scared she really will stop eating but I don't know what to do. There is only so much I can say. Not only does she feel like shit because he said I was skinnier than her, but I feel like shit because I never asked to be part of some stupid comparison. I don't want her to fall into an ED but I really don't know what to do to prevent that happening.

In high school I would purge after every meal I had to eat to “keep appearances” with the occasional binge and purge and restrictions. That all started at age 13-14? And I just turned 20. I haven’t purged since I went off to college, but ya wanna know what I just did? I binged, looked at the numbers, realized I ate X amount of calories and I felt like I had to vomit it all out before the weight appeared! Bc that’s totally how it works?! And I was looking at the fucking mess I made and I felt satisfied, relieved, disgusted, and numb all at once. Now I have a sore throat, that lingering vomit smell clinging to the inside of my nostrils, and that nausea. 

I truly don’t know how to feel. I’m hoping I’ll go to bed, wake up, and be fine tomorrow. I want to look at this as a hiccup and that I am fine! Bc it was just this week that I felt comfortable eating nuts and nut butters (fear food of mine) and I was so happy, but then today, I just lost it. And I’m both wanting to cry and not care all at once. I’ll be honest, I have binged once or twice since moving, but I told my self “that it was okay, and that tomorrow I’ll be better, don’t throw up don’t throw up” and I just had that chant going on in my Head. But today? I was on autopilot. I did it so much in the past that It is beyond easy to induce vomiting. I’m disgusted by the amount of “tricks” I learned both online and by experience. And I hate how I used them again. 

I’m not sure what to do, and I don’t feel comfortable telling anyone. Because I tried so hard to tell family or friends back then and no one did anything. My own sister (7 years older than me) just said that she didn’t realize how bad it was, which means she knew something was wrong but did nothing. My mom and my aunt commented on how I was “eating like a baby bird” but didn’t do anything. My aunt noticed that I would run to the bathroom after every meal, and when she asked about it, I denied it. But damn, that was the only time I felt seen. I wanted someone to grab me and say stop, but I had to do it myself. And I guess I gotta do it again! I even showed my best friend what I did! And she said nothing! Did nothing! Now that I’m grown, I am shocked at their lack of action. 

And I don’t know what to do! I was never diagnosed, I never saw a therapist, and now I can’t at risk of losing everything, and I don’t know what to do. I feel alone. And I have only met one other person who has dealt with this issue and has spoken about it openly with me and I just felt judged by her? Which that might have been my insecurities? Like I was never “sick enough”. I mean I would always drastically lose weight, but I was never skinny, so maybe that’s why no one helped?

I'm not sure if it's an eating disorder or so much as a bad relationship with food. But here it goes!

My family has a full bottomed and hipped physique, so naturally it fell on to me when I was at the end of my middle school and entering my high school life. From a young age I noticed I wouldn't be able to fit into my cousins clothes, so I've always known I was bigger. In high school I was always noticed for having a big butt, which is so embarrassing at that age. I didn't know how to comfortably embrace my very hour glass shape, and sometimes I still don't.

After high school and after being a relationship for a year with my ex, I noticed the comfort weight you gain when in a relationship. So I tried going to the gym and eating eight, loose motivation a month after, rinse and repeat. I can never find the motivation to keep going with good progress. Then I turn to that blasted comfort food with all those sugars, sodium, and carbs.

Depression started to hit me in my early 20s pretty bad and at first I would eat more when depressed, then around 2015 I was introduced to the whole 30 diet. It went great at first, was able to make meals and all that jazz, but then the complexity of the meals started to get to me, but I decided I was committed. With depression lingering and the guilt of breaking my diet hanging over, I then just took to stop eating. I would only eat after a couple days and make sure it was something small within the diet. More or less it was a small handful of a snack that was related to the diet, then that's keep me going until my next hunger pains. But.... I lost weight... So I liked it. Whenever I ate after that realization I felt guilty.

Since that time in 2015 whenever I start to feel down about my weight my automatic response is to stop eating. It also happens when I start to work out and eat healthy, I will eat the healthy food if it's available but it I loose motivation to cook I will ignore my urges to eat and then stop eating again. It's become a cycle where I find myself starting to fall into that habit, I stop eating for a few days, and then I bounce back because I tell myself it's not a logical response.

I am much heavier from my high school graduation year in 2010. I tell myself that the weight gain isn't terrible in 10 years. Then I find myself guilty when I compare myself to other people from the same grad year and see how much more they gain, which is dumb... And honestly it doesn't really make me feel any better but I fake it.

I've been following this page for a couple weeks and wondering what I would even say. If I would offend anyone and then just talked off because others have it worse.. I don't know if this is mild anorexic behavior or just me being lazy or some other dumb reason.. But I feel like I wanted to talk about it here and see if others have experienced the same relationship with food and weight as I have.",Request: Maybe I have an eating disorder?

I say this as I have worked very closely with people with mental health difficulties (in a mental health hospital), including people close to me, and I have the ambition of improving our understanding of mental health conditions and improving diagnosis and treatment procedures. I am therefore hoping that you guys will help me out with my research and help me work towards my overall goal of improving mental health care (which is desperately needed)!

People who have developed BED Do you think it was possibly due to a lack of control you felt in your everyday life? I personally never had any real issue with food until I moved in with a man who pretty much controls everything. Since I’ve started to feel like I have zero control every evening when I’m here I have no control over how much I eat and will just eat and eat and eat until I go to bed. I often bring my daughter to my mothers house for visits since she lives out of town and there, I control my portions pretty well.

286,EDPostRequests,1588846053,gf3tqk,"Currently stuck in a constant stress situation and really having difficulties to cope with it right. Heres my - sorry maybe a bit long- story. 
I have been in therapy years ago for depressions and self harming behavior (cutting) which gladly through therapy I have never done again. Or so I thought. Looking back now after spending the last weeks kind of reflecting my life I feel like maybe I have just constantly switched nethids to harm me and my body.
When I stopped therapy i was general in a good state. I started slowly gaining weight at that point. I had a very troubled relationship at that point that i dont like reliving. I have noticed that the worse the relationship got... The more i kind of turned to food. Not just for satisfaction but also vecause i generally wanted to become unattractive and overlooked by other men. Looking back i notice ive used my overweight as some kind of protection shield from me against the world. And it helped. I never got attwntion by guys anymore and i was honestly kibd of happy. It gave me an excuse to run away from ever catching feelings for the wrong person again.
It took me a long time toeal. I had been single for years when 2016 i started attending music festivals and opening up to people again. During that time I have also startwd being bothered by my weight. I didnt need peotextion anymore so start of 2017 i started losing weight, wanting to become thw energetic person again that i used to be. The diet and gymngit kibd of an obsession. Within 7 months i had lost many kilos and went from a bodyfat of 41% to 25% absolutely healthy. . I was genuinely happy with how i looked but suribg that time ive started really developing body dysmorphia slightly. I kept training it was my new way of a feeling well bubble.
I have managed to keep this up healthy by rigorously working out and being fascinated by the changes this caused. Then at the mid of 2018 my preparation for my law exams started. I have always had been anxious about exams but it reached a new lvl. Losing appetite, trying to be in perfect shape while being the perfect study and that all despite having a part time job. During these months I kind of tried keeping control of my life by controlling every bite i ate hiding it under a fassade of healthy clean eating. Noone saw that despite working out 1h cardio each day plus weights 4 times per week this has started becoming an unhealthy obsession. Summer 2018 was the first times i passed out due to this. Ofc playing it down by simply being in the rush and just kind of forgotting to eat, low blood preaaure and sugar. I think some might be able to relate.
My parents and i dont blame them till nowadays have no clue about all of this. My family is extremly sporty, my mom has a very lean traines figures and quite often makes comments about not gaining weight back, how a dress would look better with 1 or 2 kg less deapite me being far from overweight with 22% bodyfat.
I couldnt keep up the restricted diet. Got binge eating attacks which made me proper sick. I felt disgusted by myself. Managed to maintain an actual healthy lifestyle because i swore myself to never fall back.
Then my exam period got more and more intense. I forgot to eat. Not out of purpose but around that time i started liking that feeling. I got obsessed with tracking my food to a point where i would weigh salad and cucumber. But those every few days lead to me binging on food, making me sick in the end. I felt horrible but also kind of soothed. It kepts
 getting worse until i met my current boyfriend. He till nowadays has no clue about it but he has after a long time finally made me feel good about myself again. Without even noticing i was able to maintain a completly healthy diet or non diet around me. The stress at home and my law finals then made me spiral down.
I dont know what he does with me but he is the one person that has always managed to keep me sane and less stressed. And just like maintain a healthy life style that apart from you a few downfalls i was able to upkeep for months.
This january my obsessions started again. I went down to a body i actually felt stunning in. Despite being dizzy half the night and by far not reaching this in a healthy way.
Since then i keep wondering wether i should reconsider therapy. I know my eating is somewhat disordered but it comes in phases depending on the environment i am in. I cant even lavel it properly because i switch from one extreme to the other.. 
I genuinely know it isn't good but it doesnt make me feel bad as long as it stays unnoticed by others.
I keep thinking that i still could always stop it but then again I am starting to become doubts. I am obsessed with the scale again, the lockdown due to covid keeps me from going to the gym. I feel like i am losing control slowly but also that i could still stop.
I genuinely having issues accepting that therapy might be the way again. I dont feel like im sick enough since i do believe that if i wanted i could stop. But it is making this time right now so much easier to atleast have control about my body.

Just got out of a fight for not revealing somsthong to my boyfriend that i should have talked about long ago. I keep wondering if I should talk about this with him properly. Instead of the short remarks i sometimes made before.
After the past weeks I genuinely feel like he might have enough of it all. Weve had a few fights. I know there's a point i should open up. But it's hard to admit how broken parts of me are. When to me he's everything i wanted. I have never felt so truly accepted by someone, never felt so loved. Im afraid of ruining it. We are only together for a year but already have a long journey behind us. Idk how to even adress it properly. Having difficulties talking about it.

Any advices?
Should i consider a therapy? I dont want to take spots that belong to someone suffering under way more serious issues. I feel like this gives me hold. It gives me focus, power and control. But then again i feel like maybe im just convincing myself of this to justify a new method of harming myself.

Then I immediately regret it afterword because it’s awful and no one deserves to be talked to like that. In a way, he’s getting a sense of what it’s like to live with my thoughts but I would never want to subject anyone to feel that way so I hate myself for doing it.

I've lost 2 kg easily (~5 pounds I think) but whilst losing weight I was so so stressed about food. I constantly had thoughts about fasting, about losing weight faster, but then I got anxious because I didn't want to go back to my old habits. 2 weeks ago I went on keto and again stressed so much over how I look, checking my weight several times a day, HUNGRY and craving all day everyday. I'm scared I won't be able to lose weight in a balanced way. I'm scared I won't ever lose weight and I'll struggle with food. 
Yesterday I stopped counting, I stopped restricting... but the quarantine isn't helping at all. Laying in bed or sitting on a chair drives me crazy. I barely burn any calories, I'm hungry, stressed, angry, sad, guilty, unfulfilled, scared. + ofc body dysmorphia cuz why not.

I only found out I was for sure starting the Friday before and had no time to prepare myself mentally. I also couldn't talk to anyone about it because I found out on that Tuesday that my therapist randomly left and I was being transferred without any closure/termination session. Then on the day I was starting the program my new therapist called me and told me that she was cancelling my appointment and that if I don't successfully graduate from PHP I wouldn't get mental health services through my insurance again. She set me up to fail and I feel so trapped.

On the second day of PHP my dietitian told me I needed residential and they can't offer the level of care/support I need. I told her my psychiatrist already asked for residential and my insurance denied it. So she just told me me ""you might make some progress, but it will be very very slow"" and that made me feel more hopeless.

I feel very alienated from the group. They all have a group text together. They game together after program. I try to include myself in conversation but I have social anxiety and it's really hard. No one ever talks to me, no one even says hi. After meals I lay on the couch and cry. I do my best to talk during groups, and sometimes respond to other people. There was one person who did talk to me, but he graduated on Friday.

I'm extremely sick from eating. I have gastroparesis. It could last for months. Every time I eat I feel sick for hours, and I have to keep eating more at program. My doctors can't/won't help. So I purge as soon as I get home. When I'm not at program I don't eat.

I've been overweight for most of my life, and I've had an ED for more than 6 years now. Over the past year, I've tried to fix a lot of my dangerous behaviors (binging and purging with exercise, calorie counting, IF, etc.) and I've gotten to a place where I have a much healthier relationship with food and exercise. I was even at the point where I would almost call myself recovered. But since we've been staying home, I can't go to the gym or walk as much as I'd like to, so I decided to do a home workout challenge that would keep me active every day. And I've been losing weight. And even though I know it's in a healthy way (I'm not starving myself now, I'm not restricting, I'm not using exercise as a punishment for eating), it's still really hard not to fall into the same mindsets I used to have.
I started weighing myself every day, then multiple times a day, and every now and I would take my measurements, and it felt really good when the numbers were down. But sometimes they weren't, and even though I would tell myself that weight fluctuates and the scale saying that I'm a couple pounds higher than I was yesterday morning doesn't matter and what matters is being active and healthy, it would still make me feel terrible and that old part of my mind would tell me to exercise more to make up for it, which I know is wrong. So I decided the scale is not part of my recovery, and I hid it away and haven't looked at it for two days now. However, I still do want to lose weight as I am overweight for my body type. Is there a good way to track this without having to actually look at the numbers as that is apparently a trigger for my ED? I really am afraid of falling back into all of my old habits and I don't want to do that, but I do want to continue getting to a healthier place and feeling confident in my body.

303,EDPostRequests,1588586006,gd8puz,"Hello. A few days ago, when I was unpacking my things, my roommate and best friend found my scale. I had nearly forgotten about it. I’ve been doing relatively well recently: I’ve started doing light exercise, and had not weighed myself in a few weeks. My friend knows that I had previously struggled with disordered eating, but nothing beyond that. They are very protective of me, however, and said they would keep the scale. I thought it was a good idea, and believed I was ready given my recent progress. 

Since then, I became more conscious that someone other than me was keeping my scale away from me, and I began having flashbacks of a time when I was really struggling. I also became very conscious that I did not know my body weight. 

It reached its peak this afternoon; I found myself staring into my mirror for hours, recalling bad experiences. I wanted the scale back. So I knocked on my roommate’s door and pleaded to have it back. Although they agreed to let me have it back, they became distressed with how I put them in a position in which they couldn’t refuse me. They expressed their wishes to stop reaching out to me if I continued to engage in such self-harming and other-harming actions. 

Furthermore, while I feel better about having my scale back, knowing my body weight has made me feel worse. I don’t know what to do. I’m deathly scared that I will fall into the patterns I have tried to stay away from so long, but (as these things are) I also feel so tempted to reach into these familiar and ‘comfortable’ patterns. 

I’d really appreciate some advice on what I can do to keep my friend close to me without hurting him, as well as how I can quell unhealthy desires and memories that are filling me with anguish.

Anyways, I have always been a skinny girl who can eat a lot without gaining weight. A lot of girls were jealous of me and I understood why, I mean exercising is terrible and I hate it and I could never do it to lose weight. I used to love to eat. I’m a picky eater but the things I love I would eat a lot, like junk food, nutella and that kind of stuff.
Since I went to college (2 years ago) though, things changed. I’m a very lazy person and I also love to smoke weed, and I would sometimes spend the last money I had on weed and not on food. I know that’s a problem too but I promise I am much better now. However, during this time, I didn’t eat a lot, sometimes I would only eat a meal throughout the day, even though I was hungry I just didn’t have food, so yeah I would endure the hunger and sometimes even pain that came with that hunger. And I kinda got used to the hunger and kinda stopped feeling it. There were days were it was like 10 pm and I would realize that I hadn’t eaten anything that day because I just didn’t feel hungry the whole day. 
And this is me now. I have food available  now but I still am too lazy to sometimes get out of bed and eat and I’ll tell myself “let me just watch an episode and I’ll get up” and 3 hours later I’m still there. Because of this quarantine I’m in parent’s house now and I have been forcing myself to eat even when I don’t feel like it and, besides not gaining any weight which left me really frustrated, I just hate eating even more now, it even makes me sick thinking of food because I don’t want to eat honestly. It’s not that I want to lose weight, I want to gain weight even. People sometimes joke about me not having a big ass or boobs and I get really frustrated with that.

Hi everyone! Hope you’re all doing well :) 
I’m looking for some advice on my eating issues but I haven’t been able to find quite what I’m dealing with so I thought I’d ask to see if anyone has had similar experience.
I don’t think I have an ED, but I know I have issues with food. When I was a child I was incredible picky, and my mom was incredibly insensitive about it. I was yelled at every day, for almost every meal. There was very little food I would eat, to the point of having basically the same thing everyday, and that list for shorter with every screaming match or entire evening spent at the table for not wanting hot dogs or whatever. 
Anyways as a teen it got worse when my mom started working long days and I became responsible for feeding myself, and I failed at it real hard. 
I had no idea how to cook and was already anxious about food, so I hated the kitchen. I hated cooking, I hated the stove and the oven. I made peanut butter sandwiches and instant mashed potatoes and eventually hummus. I never ate, not because I didn’t want to be fed or because of issues surrounding myself (I think) 
I just really hate cooking and eating at home now. I open the fridge or the pantry and freeze at the amount of food that in it. I write menus for myself and prep food but when I’m hungry I get so anxious about cooking that I’d rather just not eat for days. Its like a flip switches and suddenly I can’t remember how to make anything, food smells disgusting, everything looks hard and confusing. I just go back to my room and cry. It’s always been like this and I’ve just dealt with the low iron and the dizziness and the cold hands and weak immune system because I didn’t care. But now i’m trying to be better to myself and I can’t get past the kitchen. I feel so pathetic, I can’t even feed myself. 
I know this isn’t a regular eating disorder question and people might now have advice, but has anyone gone through a similar relationship with food? Does anyone have advice on how to start making the kitchen a comfortable place, and food a comfortable option?

I went from being overweight to a healthy albeit low BMI range. I did that in less than a year, and I was real proud of myself. I achieved my healthy weight from eating cleaner, moving around a lot more etc. 

I thought I would be happy with how I looked, but I didn't. I hate the way my arms still looks flabby and the fats around my stomach just wouldnt go away. I started going crazy about numbers, I made sure I ate the exact number I set for myself, and I make sure to burn them a few times a week by exercising. For a while, this was going great. I lost/kept my weight, but I just couldn't stop. My body didn't change much, I was still unhappy with it.

With this quarantine going on and everyone in my country are required to stay at home, I didn't get the chance to exercise. I lost control, ate a lot of snacks and every time I weigh myself I see the numbers fluctuating. My mom had always joked about my body/weight (since I used to be overweight, she would joke about me not being able to fit through my door). She don't mean any harm, but I get really devastated when she mentioned that I've gained weight during quarantine. I started to restrict even more, I stopped having my dinners and I purchased weeks worth of meal replacements. I just wanted to get to the weight I at least liked myself in. I thought it was going to help me lose the weight, until my brother scolded me, and said that I've gotten so bad I needed to resort to eating powder for my meals. I didn't understand what he said.

I [19m] was overweight my whole life, but have been fat shamed by everyone around me. At first, I just wanted to lose some weight and I wanted to try out being vegan, that was in February. But during that month my restrictive diet turned into restrictive food intake and during quarantine it spiralled out of control. Suddenly I'm scared of any food that is over a certain amount of calories and I will eat like 1 meal a day at max. I survive on sugar free energy drinks, coffee and fruit. My therapist wanted me to call the hospital about it and they said my weight isn't low enough yet for me to get help there. I lost a ton of weight but I'm still slightly overweight, because I've only had that problem for a few months. Their comment 'motivated' me in the wrong way.

317,EDPostRequests,1589560798,gkck21,"Hello,
I'd just like to start off by saying that I don't think that I have an eating disorder, it's just that I think that this is the most appropriate place to seek help.

Earlier this year I began restricting and lost a lot of weight that I was very happy with, and after that I began to eat more normally. However, throughout that period of eating normally I was still quite obsessed with my body image, weight, and calorie intake. 

Recently I have begun to restrict again and whilst I definitely want to do this in order to lose more weight, I recognise that my long term behaviour in which I am obsessed with how thin I look in the mirror and the guilt I feel after eating food is not healthy for me.

I do not have the behaviour necessary nor the body type in order where I would feel comfortable seeking medical help - like I don't feel like I deserve it. But yet these thoughts and obsession in my head are really painful for me. I also don't feel comfortable reaching out to my friends and family, as I feel as a boy, that they wouldn't understand my issues of my body image.

I'm just seeking some help, as I feel I'm in quite an odd position here.

I don’t really want to lose any more weight, so why do I feel immense anxiety and have to make myself sick whenever I feel full?

Since corona started, i’ve lost most of my routine. I used to get my daily food intake by socially eating with friends at restaurants and whatnot. Things are different now. Restaurants are closed, I can’t see my friends and my diet is suffering. I rarely eat and when I do, it’s one meal at nighttime and maybe a snack later.

It’s worrying me. I feel so alone in this because everyone else in my life loves eating and has a healthy eating schedule. Then there’s me who skips 2/3 meals a day and struggles with body image. I’m slightly underweight for my height yet my brain tells me to eat less, shames me for finishing a meal and then convinces myself to eat less next time. I’m so terrified of eating healthy and gaining healthy weight because im not used to my body at a healthy weight. idk it’s hard to explain but i’m just scared so I subconsciously avoid eating.

322,EDPostRequests,1589438467,gjgzj8,"Lockdown has been hard and my struggles with disordered eating/body image have resurfaced. A few months before lockdown I had just started regularly attending the gym and I’ve managed to maintain a decent routine even while at home. Right now I’m probably in the best shape of my life. 

But today was the first day I’ve deliberately skipped a meal since I first managed to ‘recover’ from a period of disordered eating when I was around 17-18 years old. I’m a student and I notice that I begin to panic about my body image during periods of stress, which almost always boils down to an obsession with not visibly gaining weight (key word ‘visibly’ - as I do not weigh myself). 

Thankfully, before today I had never felt the need to act on this obsession again. The guilty thoughts have *never* gone away - I still feel guilty after ever meal - but I have always powered through. I suppose today was the tipping point. 

What scares me most is that I’m not able to exercise enough. I’m incredibly exhausted and stressed about my exams. I workout everyday but I have little time or energy for cardio. I panic that I am losing progress made in the gym (in terms of muscle mass) but also that I’m visibly gaining weight as I eat more to give my body the fuel it needs. 

I’m questioning whether I even have an earring disorder or whether I’m simply conscious of my weight, but I’m not sure where to turn. Nearly all of the ED support provided by my university is for women. I feel isolated as male eating disorders are not something spoken about often. I’m ashamed to mention these feelings to my girlfriend because I don’t want her to view me as less masculine (stupid, I know).

328,EDPostRequests,1589362962,givw01,"In short, I [18F] have struggled with disordered eating to some degree since I was 13ish. Nothing clinically diagnosed or extreme. I’ve always struggled with an over-fixation on self image and weighing myself to make sure I stay consistent with my weight. I started college this past fall, and honestly, it was very good for me. I wasn’t surrounded by unhealthy choices and I didn’t even have access to a scale. For the first time in 5 years, I finally felt somewhat free. However, coming back home early because of COVID has triggered my eating habits in such an extreme manner that I never expected. 


My dad is overweight, definitely borderline obese. When I came home for winter break, I was pleasantly surprised to discover he had lost nearly 30 pounds because of a diet his doctor has placed him on. I finally thought his eating habits would get back on track, but quarantine has made him gain all of the weight back and I would say he’s at his heaviest right now. 


It has now been two months of watching my dad eat in excess every single day. He struggles to lift himself off the couch, chews with his mouth wide open, gets out of breath because he eats so fast, and constantly argues with my mom who occasionally tries to gently remind him of his diet. He’s self conscious about his weight, which makes me feel bad for even writing this. But at the same time, he’s not making any effort to change. Heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, etc runs in my family. My mom and I have been worried for his health for years now, and it’s something that stresses me out a ton to this day.  I’m worried it’ll take years off his life.


I know these sound like such stupid little ticks, but my father’s eating habits have gotten to the point where they are dramatically affecting my own. Any progress I made during my time in college has gone out the window. In short, desserts make me freak out. If I eat a slice of cake, I’ll stress myself out to the point where I need to go on a run to feel better. I don’t give myself “cheat days” anymore because I’ll stress myself out to the point where I feel sick. I don’t take days off of exercising now. As badly as I want comfort food, it gives me extreme anxiety to think of and I end up opting for fruit instead. I can’t be in the room with my dad while he’s eating anymore, something about it stresses me out to some insane degree. At family dinners, I face the opposite direction from him. I’ve been constantly tracking my caloric/nutritional data through an app and it’s become obsessive- yet I cant stop. 


I wasn’t like this when I left school. I don’t know why I feel this way, or what I’m feeling can even be considered an actual, textbook “eating disorder”. I feel like there are definitely some deeper psychological issues at hand, but I don’t know what to do. I want to tell my mom how I’m feeling, because I know my dad would feel extreme guilt. Just putting myself in his position, if I had discovered I was a factor in my daughter’s eating disorder, I would be devastated. And instead of encouraging, I feel like it would have the opposite effect and lead into emotional/coping eating for him. But my relationship with food and exercise is the worst it’s ever been, and the worst I ever realized it was capable of becoming. This has all occurred as just a result of spending two months at home. Should therapy be the way to go? Having a family intervention?

344,EDPostRequests,1589106736,ggz589,"I have always struggled with food. In high school, I was a little overweight, but I thought I was much bigger than I was. I've always had no control and would binge multiple times a week. Sometimes I would try to throw up, but it never made me feel better, so I didn't do it often. I would do a fast once a week, and I figured that kept my overall intake to near average.

Fast forward 10 years, I've put on a significant amount of weight and am now morbidly obese. I still struggle with feeling out of control when it comes to junk. And I spent the last few years alternating pregnancy and breastfeeding. I never fasted during that time because I didn't want to hurt my babies or my milk supply.

So last year, My husband (also morbidly obese) and I decided to make a change and lose weight and get healthy. We completely cut out all sugar and carbs. Its hard to binge on junk food when everything is off limits, so going cold turkey seemed like a good idea. This diet seems to have really curbed my appetite, so I tried intuitive eating and ended up eating far below my calorie minimum. I thought since I was so fat, it was okay, I could live off the fat on my body. I read about people who extended fast and are fine. I started fasting again. I don't do more that 2 days usually, but its not hunger that stops me. Its that nagging feeling that this can't be healthy.

I started feeling low energy, and with 2 toddlers, that's a big problem. So I committed to no more fasting, and eating at least enough calories to function as recommended for my gender. But in march I lost my job, and since then my weight loss has plateaued. Idk if it's stress or the fact that I'm no longer on my feet 20 hours a week, but I haven't changed my diet and my weight won't budge. I'm still charting everything I eat, barely reaching my minimum goals, eating half as much as calculators say I need to maintain my weight. Every week when the scale doesn't move I get more and more desperate. I've started using laxatives more frequently (that started under a doctor's direction due to a medical issue, and then I just... Didn't stop) and sometimes I have had a mini binge on low carb junk food and then felt so bad I had to purge.

I know this isn't right, but maybe its okay to stop eating again? Go back to almost nothing, just until the weight comes off. Then once I'm at a healthier weight, I can focus on fixing these bad habits. I don't see a way to be healthy. I'm still morbidly obese. I'm not going to die from not eating. Following the rules isn't working, so I feel like I have to do something. My kids deserve a mom that can run around with them. I've failed. 

I know that this is stressing me out most of all right now because I had set myself a reasonable goal for mothers day, and I was on track to make it before I plateaued.

I started eating fruits and veggies and I think now I have a regular diet. I also used to struggle with anorexia/bulimia.I have gotten over the bad habits I had formed, I still have problems with my thought process like trying to gauge my weight with everyone I see, or getting upset at how much I eat. 

But basically what I struggle with the most now is thinking food is dirty or gross. I can’t eat the stem end of any produce because it feels so dirty (especially the stem end of tomatoes or grapes). I also need to hand wash all of my own produce and don’t trust anyone else to do it because I’m scared of microscopic bugs being on everything, especially fruit and leafy greens. I used to avoid all peppers because of the skin on the outside, can’t eat sausages or hotdogs because the casings are just gross and the ends of them look like buttholes. I have trouble eating fruit sometimes because I saw a video on Instagram of a strawberry under a microscope with live bugs crawling on it and I can’t help but feel like I’m eating dirt or bugs unless I wash the fruit for a very long time until I feel like it’s clean enough. I also didn’t eat anything with tomatoes for weeks because I had read something about a certain limit of bugs allowed in canned tomatoes, I only got over the fear because I had to have my boyfriend google it for me and tell me if it was true or not. The thought of bugs or dirt in my food actually terrifies me and I don’t know why, in most situations I would rather go hungry than eat something that I don’t feel is clean enough. Also, any time I get food from a restaurant I pick through it to make sure everything I’m eating is clean enough. For example, I tear apart my chicken tenders and inspect each piece and will refuse to eat a piece if it has a red vein in it or anything else other than pure chicken meat and when I get chipotle I pick through the pico to make sure I don’t have any tomato stem pieces in it.

Need help and I don’t know to what degree because I don’t know if this has gotten out of control or not.

I grew up very active and I had always been “fit” for instance in high school all my friends were 00 and I was the ""big"" friend (even though I wasn’t I had normal body fat) and all the boys would nick name me tree trunk legs, etc.

I also have a very high maintenance mom who overly obsessed over how I look in public and to others and have never been about to eat what I want in fear of being judged.

skip to 4 years later I gained a significant amount but then I have recently “dieted” to lose it all , and have been at a weight I’ve been semi satisfied. After losing all this weight I’ve become so obsessive with how I look in clothes, what I eat and how I feel. I often find myself eating meals with others just to throw it up so I feel less bad about myself.

I hate when I feel bloated and try to avoid any food that makes me feel bad. I’ve been in the same relationship for 5 years and find myself at times after I eat going straight to bed because I don’t want to be touched or have sex after eating because it makes me feel so fat and insecure.

Hi, so I don't know much about eating disorders or really what they look like and what makes them up; however, I do know what disordered eating looks like. I am certain that my eating is disordered, but I'm not sure what the psychology is behind it and I thought maybe someone here could help.

So basically, I hardly eat at all.

I am fine with my body weight and have never had a problem with that. I'm not trying to lose weight. I do have depression, and understand that part of that is lacking motivation for basic needs like eating.

When I have food available to me that is quick and easy I can usually get over the depression bit (the motivation to like move part) but when I look at the food and have it in front of me it is almost unbearably difficult to eat. I get nauseous (which can be from a lack of food) and can't palate it. When it's something I really like I can get a good few bites of it at first but I'll still end hungry.

Often I will make myself a meal and it will take me hours to finish. I realize by the end of the day that I've eaten the equivalent of like half a meal which is NOT okay.

I think the main problem is that I don't want to eat. What used to be something I took a lot of joy in has become uninteresting and exhausting. Nothing sounds good, what makes it into my mouth is repulsive, and its become a task that I dread every day.

I'm really used to feeling hungry, but I don't really want to be. I just don't know how to get myself to eat or how to make it a normal experience again.

My sister is 16, and I have noticed that she's been eating less and less over the past year. At first, I figured she was just doing a slight caloric deficit to lose a little weight, as although she's not fat, she is a little overweight which she had told me before she wanted to do something about. I think she looks beautiful at any weight, but she dismissed me. Over the past few months, since quarantine started, and I've been home from University more and able to see what she eats all day, it's a startlingly low amount! Yesterday I heard her talking with my brother (10), saying ""omg, I ate Soo much today"". He asked what she ate. She said she ate some blueberries, and a protein bar. As a regular gym goer and lifter, I'm used to tracking calories (for weight GAIN so I can build muscle!) So I quickly realized that this was far less than a healthy intake! 
Now, Im athletic, and toned, so naturally I've become slim from exercising so much. But I also eat a LOT because I lift weights. I eat more than 4x the Cal's a day as she does, and I know that she envies my body, because we've talked about it before.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 21, and I've always had a problematic relationship with food. I've always been fat, and I binged since I have memory. From snacking at midnight when I was 7, to buying unhealthy food when i was 13, and having 2 or 3 portions of my meals when I was 16. I've been bullied, I have a bad relationship with my mother (disabled since I was 4 for an accident and divorced) and I hate my sister (younger, she tried to kill me, she left home during the quarantine cause she wanted to hang out with her friends, saying that it was our fault for not letting her go outside). I went to a bad hischool, I had bad grades, bad friend. I developed suicidal thoughts, I cut myself, I ate myself to sleep. I was obese, alone, treated like a chef, a caregiver, a driver, doing laundry, cleaning, running errands. I received some money from my mother's insurance, so as soon as I turned 18 I went to a psychologist, hiding that to my family. I was saying that I was having long days at uni.

&amp;#x200B;

That's my background, but I'm not here to talk about that. I had a health problem, I was anemic, so I've never really been able to do heavy sports. As soon as I was cured, I started going to the gym. I've lost a lot of weight, starving myself. I went crying to an estetic surgeon to have my excessive skin removed, but he refused cause I'm too young.

&amp;#x200B;

I went anorexic. I lost so many kilos that I was underweight. I kept binging, but this time I had energy. I overexcercised. And etcetera..

&amp;#x200B;

But there's a new chapter. I decided I wanted to make things right. I went to a nutritionist, and he told me I had no muscles. I needed to eat more. I started putting on weight. That's when I discovered purging.

&amp;#x200B;

I've used a lot of healthy and unhealthy behaviors

&amp;#x200B;

I'm desperate. I'm really desperate.

I've lost my period. I've lost hope. I don't want to fight anymore

Finally putting it somewhere: I am in the middle of a relapse.

After a few weeks in quarantine, I chose a pair of shorts that I hadn’t worn in a while.

Well, they almost didn’t fit. I don’t recall if it was that day, or soon after, but I have found myself in a hole of fasting and b/p behaviours, after years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of these last 3 years my whole life has changed, and I am in the happiest place I have ever been in my life.... until this all started again. I am overweight, and learning that I had become more so after finally accepting what I had (because I had been maintaining it over the last few years) has absolutely wrecked the sense of taking care of myself that I once had.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently living alone due to COVID and there is no way I’m going to show this side of me to the friends and partners I have in the healthiest parts of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Although it is still early for me this time, I can admit that I know this is a relapse, and I know that it is already scary. Truthfully, I have no idea if I am going to manage to make my way out in time. My head is telling me that this time is the perfect time to follow through on these behaviours, so I don’t “have to” when I am back in the real world. The thing is, I don’t feel like it’s me who decides what I “have to do” to begin with.

Quarantine has made me relapse more than ever and I’m struggling to take control. After all the helpful advice on the post I thought about telling my family more and really wanted to take that step. In the end I couldn’t bring myself to do it. My dad is currently unemployed and my grandfather on my mom’s side has stage four pancreatic cancer. I didn’t want to contribute to their stress or burden them during this time so I kept it to myself.

But today we were told that my grandfather has only around a month or two to live. We had been planning a visit during March but cancelled flights due to corona. Now my mom is leaving for Korea tomorrow. I think she will be gone for a month or two. 

I’m 16, living in Canada. We have no other family here except the four of us (mom, dad, younger brother, me). I’ll have to cook for the family and I’ll be alone in the house more. I’m scared because my mom is leaving and without her I think my eating disorder is going to get worse. I love my dad but I don’t think I would tell him, especially not when my mom is not around. 

I’m scared for my mom because she regrets not being by my grandfather and grandmother. It’s been almost all my life since we’ve been living abroad and years since we’ve visited him. I hate that because of corona we won’t even be able to say goodbye. 

Sorry if it sounds like a pity party. I just needed a place to vent because none of my friends know and I don’t feel ready to share everything.

In the past year its taken the form of periods of restriction and periods where I will fast until the evening then binge. After I binge, I will often throw up or exercise (but not excessively). Restriction periods and binge periods both tend to last a couple of weeks before something triggers one to turn into the other

With both, I never eat full meals and never eat until around 5pm or later (I might have calories before then but liquid or &lt;50 cals only)

I'm wondering about the classification as I'm thinking of telling my mum about it - I'm not sure if it's bulimia as often I purge only a small amount when I first break my fast (and am trying to get back into a restrictive period) and not always after the full binge (because then I'm like fuck it I'll start again tomorrow). Plus, when I am restricting heavily I purge fairly often as well. Also I was wondering if fasting for ~18 hours daily post binge is purging?

I see a therapist who knows I have dysmorphia and food issues but not the full extent.

Basically, I have this friend \[we’ll call her Z to avoid confusion\] who suffers from bulimia. The thing is, though, that she’s triggering in a way that honestly kind of shocks me. Unlike most people, she does this thing where she doesn’t hide it but also does? It’s hard to explain. At first, it was a lot more subtle, but lately she’s become more blatant about it: she’ll talk about being malnourished all the time, as though it‘s this big accomplishment that she’s proud of, to the point where it sounds likes she’s almost bragging. She’ll constantly mention that she hasn’t eaten for long periods of time, as well. It’s kind of like a secret that everyone knows.

Lately, she’s also taken to putting things in the captions, of her private Instagram account, that say things like: ‘I lost x amount of pounds a bitch is gonna be a skinny legend‘ or ‘I gained weight and now I must pass’ *note: she is not suicidal* Her constantly talking about it has started to really trigger me, in that I get so uncomfortable and for the majority of the rest of the day I just feel so shitty and ‘depressed’ \[I use quotations because it doesn’t trigger a full episode, just the same sort of numb sadness\].

Hello

I'm new here but thought it would be a good place to seek some help

I'm 26F, from last July until now I've lost quite a significant  amount of weight, at first it was all very healthy with just being super  busy, walking everywhere and eating well but not really thinking about  food more than what I was gonna have that day. Until the lockdown I was  told a lot by others how great I looked and how much weight I'd lost, so  when we went into lockdown I got very paranoid that by the time I see  my friends and colleagues again I would be a big gross lump.

I've never been great with body image and have always been concerned  about my size but have never had what I would consider to be an eating  disorder. Even though logically I'm aware that I'm by no means fat,  I'm  now starting to get very very dysmorphic, and even though I've found  that I've lost weight since the start of lockdown, I can't remember what  I looked like before and am convinced I'm seeing a bigger person in the  mirror.

It started with me counting calories on an app making sure I ate no  more than a healthy amount for my BMI to lose weight, but then I can see  myself getting very obsessive and I'm scaring myself. I'm now at a  point where if I don't have at least a quarter of the calories left in a  day I'm convinced I'm going to gain a lot of weight and I've started to  pick up concerning habits that I've never had before. If I do let  myself eat chocolate or sweets I'll think about it for hours afterwards  and I'm constantly checking what I look like and if I'm fatter yet. 

I don't know how to stop. If I stop counting calories I'm scared I'll lose all control over myself and gain a lot of weight. 

I'm not sure what I'm asking for here but I just need to put it out  there because when I'm searching online all I'm finding is articles on  how to lose weight during this when I need some help on how to stop this  going any further. 

Sorry for the super long post.

TW: self harm

&amp;#x200B;

 Hi, I’m new here. (18F) I always had trouble eating so I was a pretty skinny child growing up. When I was about 15 I started eating more and gained a very healthy weight and people started saying I looked great. Too many people though and I started getting harassed a lot in school and it seemed like everyone had something to say about my weight or my body. I had a rather abusive “relationship” with someone that would slap my thighs or make quips about my weight being like his mother’s. So I started restricting my eating more so I’d lose weight. I stopped cutting and burning myself and instead use food as a way to hurt myself. I’d get a disappointing grade and I’d refuse to eat anything more than water or a slice of bread for days or up to a week. I’d wake up so weak that I’d barely be able to get out of bed, dizziness when I get up, fainting and even once I got a bed sore because I was barely moving and my bones were protruding so much. I’ve been depressed for a while now so whenever I’m going through a very dark time I’d be unable to eat and I’d lose the ability to care for myself. Lately because of lockdown I’ve been more obsessive about my weight so I weigh myself like 5 times a day and I’d binge eat and give up and starve for weeks on end I never really thought I had an ED because I never looked as skinny as the people on TV (I wouldn’t know though, I don’t really know what I look like) and I don’t make myself throw up, I just starve myself for days or weeks

I think I’m struggling with an eating disorder and should be getting help for an eating disorder but my problem is that I can’t relate to or find any information on what I’m personally going through. I don’t even know if what I have is considered an eating disorder. 
My issue isn’t around my weight or appearance although admittedly I have always been overly aware of those things. 
My problem started in October with a panic attack that resulted in an anxiety/panic disorder. Since then I have been obsessive and terrified over food/drink/medication. Anything that goes into my body. I am so scared to eat and I obsessively google the foods that I google to the point that i only eat a handful of things when I’m actually even able to eat. I’ve lost 4 stone and I’m now at an unhealthy weight and I’m suffering symptoms from not getting enough.. anything really. When I do eat I have to completely distract myself while doing it or I just can’t finish. 
I don’t know where to get help I don’t been think anyone would consider it an eating disorder? If anyone else’s linked to more fear over foods and appearance is secondary to that?

I was only finally diagnosed with AN-BP (I don’t binge but have a history of laxative abuse, though I have been lax free for 11months! ) 4 years ago. In that time, I’ve had numerous stints in residential programs as well as PHP and IOP but have been solely working with my (amazing) outpatient team (therapist, dietitian, psychiatrist, and PCP all with extensive ED experience) for the past 18 months.

In a lot of ways, I’ve made a ton of progress—compared to where I was even a year ago, my weight is far more stable, my behaviors are hugely diminished, and I can recognize when I am starting to slip and ask for the support I need to prevent it from getting worse. But I do still have to live by my meal plan, I do still rely on supplements to get by for at least a few snacks each week. While I generally don’t know my weight, I know that for the past year, I have been hovering just shy of my team’s target weight range.I have intense fear of gaining to that point or more even though I logically know it’s really not far from my current weight. I’m told that my perception of my body is incredibly skewed but I don’t think I’m *that* far off from reality, but what do I know.

Anyways, to get to my point, how do I move past this? I so badly want to get on with my life but cannot shake this one thing. I just viscerally feel so big and I hate it so much. I know my size has no bearing on my worth, I know I deserve to eat, I know that this isnt about trying to conform to societal ideals of beauty (frankly that drives me the most nuts because I’m generally very vocal about going my own way). My team also admits to kind of being stumped on this too--it’s the one thing that has, if anything, gotten worse as symptoms have improved.

hi everyone, seeking support. i'm asian american and i don't really see culturally-specific help for people who grew up with family dynamics like mine. also don't see as much representation in general. my asian parents don't know how to respond to the problem. they seem to want to help but whenever this topic gets brought up, they say something hurtful. i feel like i'm being too sensitive when it happens, but it feels bad enough that i just avoid the topic all together. it's also an Asian thing for relatives and family friends to greet you with a ""oh hello ____ you look so good! you lost weight!!"" or ""oh hello ____ you gained weight!! omg stop eating so much"" and then proceed to shovel your plate high with party food. additionally i don't have a habit of being emotionally honest with my parents so trying to explain my feelings feels massively embarrassing. these are 2 people who lived through the communist revolution in china, where the government was disappearing dissidents, sending off droves of young people into the countryside for useless ""reeducation,"" and food rationing/crop failures created a generation of underweight children. basically they've been through some shit and in light of all that, i feel like my problems ain't shit. but they're still problems because they're my problems. i have a hard time reconciling this generational/historical guilt and feeling like my problems are real. idk if anyone can relate, but give a shout out if you do.

Having the same realization as before, I realized I desperately need to increase my calories and I know reverse dieting is the way to go. Due to circumstances, I can't properly see a dietitian right not, but I have been able to talk to my therapist about where my mindset has been at and why I've been struggling with all of this so much. So, I've been trying to increase by just a little bit each week. I'm only up a couple hundred cals and I've been doing this for over a month now. The only problem is that I started off at a weight that's higher for someone my height based off of ideal body weight and body mass index standards. So I already had a decent bit of fat on me (I have PCOS and hypothyroidism which has also posed challenges. Both are well managed though). But since trying to increase my calories, I've already gained a ton of weight in the past month and a half. As I'm actually studying nutrition, I know that what I've gained recently, my normal weight is now almost putting my BMI into the overweight category. I'm just at a loss of what to do because I've been eating the same amount of cals for almost 3 weeks straight now and just have been consistently gaining weight (and I really don't eat any junk or sugar due to the PCOS and because I used to have T2DM and am studying dietetics) so I know that it's not a problem with what I'm eating per say.

I have been actively trying to combat my mental health and openness about it over the past 4 years. I want to be as open as possible because I think we should be able to be honest about this darker side of our lives as a society - so I try to practice what I preach. Having said that, I find it extremely difficult to do this with my eating disorder history. None of the friends I have made in the past 4 years are at all aware of me struggling.

I find it difficult for a number of reasons. I find ED's are not talked about in the same way as other mental health problems - ED's are a long way behind other mental health problems in the discussion. No one talks about the true pain of putting your body and mind through so much trauma and it's really hard to help someone understand. Every time I have tried I have ended up in a puddle of tears. They're still glamorised but only when it's restricting which is fucked up. 
 &amp;&amp; I don't want people paying more attention to what I eat and how I look. I am trying to avoid that at all costs because it triggers me. I can just about have conversations about exercise and meals but it has taken a long time. How do I forget about my ED when I know people around me are going to be thinking about my weight etc?

a new friend has asked to go swimming in the lake next week. I really want to because it would be so much fun ... If I didn't care about my body so much. I have put on so much weight over lockdown - which has been a battle itself - and there's absolutely no way I will enjoy swimming or be good company in that scenario with how I look now. 

(I haven't relapsed yet although I can feel it coming and this swimming invitation feels the first major trigger. I really don't want to eat for at least the rest of today. I haven't felt this strongly compelled to restrict in a long time.) 

I feel so confused about whether to tell my friend I can't go swimming because of my ED, make up another excuse (but what?) Or just try and do it (which makes me feel sick).
I really don't want to tell her about my ED and become even more defined by food and my body. I'm trying to leave it in the past as much as possible, &amp; I feel like once someone knows, you can't really escape that. I've felt sick and upset since she sent the message and what to reply.

I think as a society we should be able to have a lot more transparency around body image and all mental health &amp; I want to play my part in that.. but I can't bring myself to do it with my own ED !!!! Urgh.

399,EDPostRequests,1590565444,grf9p3,"Hi there, 
disclaimer: *(1) this might be an unpopular opinion post. (2)I'm speaking from a perspective of ED survivor.*

I have noticed a considerable amount of *""Do I have an eating disorder?""* posts on this sub and could not figure out what makes me feel so uncomfortable about them. These posts seem innocent, advice seeking and the members of community can reassure each other and help validate experiences and emotions. And then I realized that it was the lack of differentiation between disordered eating and eating disorders that left me feeling uneasy.

**Disordered eating** is an epidemic in our culture. It is easy to develop an unhealthy relationship with food when it is made out to be the enemy. Food then turns into something to be feared or develops the allure of the forbidden fruit, paving the way for disordered food behaviours. [1] So lets face it - it is difficult to find a woman nowadays who has never tried dieting or some sort of other restrictive eating (from keto and veganism, to raw-plant based and paleo diets). 
&gt; 53% of American girls age 13 are “unhappy with their bodies.”  This grows to 78% by the time girls reach seventeen. [2]
Low self-esteem, pressure to match unrealistic body types and connection of self-worth to ones perceived beauty -  are issues known almost universally by all woman.

Yes, disordered eating patterns should be taken seriously and it’s important to reach out to a professional team to help you find balanced ways and nourish your body. &gt; While studies show that up to 50% of the population in the USA demonstrate problematic or disordered relationships with food, body, and exercise; the rates of clinical eating disorders are much lower, estimated from 1% to 3% percent of the general population. [3] 

So where do we draw the line between disordered eating and full-blown eating disorder? It is all about degree. An individual with disordered eating is often engaged in the same behaviours as those with eating disorders but at a lesser frequency or lower level of severity. [3] As with other mental health issues, it is important to explore how and to what extent disordered eating is affecting an individual’s daily functioning. Issues to consider include the following [3]:

* Concentration and ability to focus — Do thoughts about food, body, and exercise prevent concentration or impede performance at work or school?
* Social life — Is socializing restricted because it might require eating in a restaurant, consumption of foods that are scary or uncomfortable, or disruption of exercise routine?
* Coping skills — Is food consumption and/or restriction used as a way to manage life’s problems or cope with stressors?
* Discomfort or anxiety — How much discomfort do thoughts of food and body cause? Are these thoughts hard to shake and anxiety-provoking?

In treatment, I remember visualizing my eating disorder as a dark, beautiful angel. It was my best friend, my only friend. It understood me and provided comfort, **but only when I complied with the rules**. Eds are similar to abusive relationships - they hurt you but you love them… I guess I’m writing this paragraph to show that EDs in clinical representation are not solely about food and body; Eds became a strong and prevalent coping-strategy (you can almost parallel it to addiction - addicts know that what they do is wrong, would lead to destroyed relationships, financial problems and possible death, but the high is sooo good that they can’t resist it).

Thank you for taking time to read this post. I hope it was informative. 

*P.S.1 If you recognize the eating disorder patterns in yourself, if you consider them abnormal or unhealthy, then you are in a good shape!  From my own experience (and from talking to multiple people while inpatient/outpatient) people with full-blown EDs usually refuse to accept that they have a problem: they assume their eating/exercise patterns are normal, their weight doesn’t have a bottomline, they attribute multiple skin, hair, menstruation problems to lack of vitamins or poor genetics.
So if you notice the problem and feel the desire to change, you have already accomplished a great milestone. Congratulations!*

*P.S.2 Finally, if you are reading this and if you are concerned for your loved one, it is possible that they don’t “see” what you “see”. People with full-blown Eds prior to treatment would have a hard time admitting to having a problem and this is the stage where your help is crucial.*

Hi everyone,

Pretty new to reddit, but so happy I found it. I am reaching out because I have had an ED (specifically bulimia) on and off since I was 15. I will be 30 in September. I am also a clinical dietitian for both inpatient/outpatients. It’s been such a struggle for so long. There is a lot of pressure from external sources (my job) as well as internal pressure from myself to be thin. I’m sure you all struggle with that as well. I feel like such a hypocrite in my job, I do a lot of weight management, diabetes...etc... counseling. I don’t really know if I’m reaching out for advise, I know I’m my own worst enemy. Maybe more than anything I’m looking for support? I’m terrified of therapy because I don’t want that information in my medical chart (again, being in the medical field, I am really uncomfortable with the potential for ANY providers to know any of my history (again I know HIPPA protects me but I just can’t fathom the thought of anyone knowing because I’m ashamed) I’ve kept it a secret all this time.

Right now, my sister's daily food intake is restricted to an extremely light breakfast(if we're lucky), a lunch(almost one third of what she would previously eat), and no dinner. Drinks consist of water and possibly tea/black coffee with no sugar or additives of any sort. She has lost a lot of weight compared to when she was in high school, but her weight loss rate has naturally decreased and I feel this is making her intensify her diet. She also used to exercise regularly up until the point of exertion before we were quarantined. 

During Ramadan while we were fasting, this didn't change and all she would eat during dinner was a small salad bowl and a third of a serving of what we had depending on if she saw it as healthy or not. This meant that she ate nothing with carbs or too much starch and this only happened if we encouraged here enough. 

This has taken a toll on my family and our relationship with her to an extent. My sister's a medical professional so she tries to explain to her the risks of her eating habits and I'm very close to her, so I always try to encourage her. My mom is taking a very patient and slow approach towards the subject, but that hasn't made any difference as far as I can tell. Whenever my mom actually runs out of patience and starts ranting to her, she just waits for her to finish and nothing changes. We may fight verbally, but it just ends up with her going to her room.

As for her, she's acknowledged that she does have an eating disorder(never professionally diagnosed because we haven't noticed up till now and getting professional help is hard). However, I feel like she doesn't even make an effort towards helping herself which leads me to what happened today. She had not eaten anything and mom brings her a serving of less than 100 grams of mashed potatoes. She reluctantly agreed to eat them, but she was eating them and making disgusted faces, laughing, making jokes about it, and trying to convince everyone that she's not really hungry. I just told her if she's not going to make the slightest effort, I can't stand to be in the same room with her and just left. She started sending me pics of what she ate, but at that point I was just too disappointed. She later came to my room and started telling me how hard it was for her. I acknowledged that fact, but told her she's not even trying despite us trying to help her and this ended in another fight.

Now, I do realize that my approach is not the best, I'm not well-equipped to deal with a sickness like this but all I can think of is how harmful this is for her health and I can't stand just not doing anything to stop it, but all I see is that she won't even try to help herself. So, I guess my question is what can I do to help her because me and my family's approach is clearly not working and all it's doing is creating more frustration for all of us especially her.

She has always been conscious about her weight, mainly focusing on eating healthyly and not eating many sweets, but generally, I always felt like we stayed within a healthy mindset.

Recently however, she has confided in me that she feels unattractive after eating food. She doesn't like the way her stomach looks after she ate something (even though it is completely normal that your belly gets a little round after eating something). She also says that she feels like she bloats a lot and that that makes her feel even uglier. 

So therefore, on somedays she says eating food just isn't worth it for her if she feels bad about her body afterwards and that she sometimes feels guilty for eating because then she doesn't look pretty anymore.

So she will sometimes not eat something for 1-2 days just so her belly looks flat.

This is terrifying to me. I have tried a lot of things. First and foremost telling her that it is normal that your belly looks a little round after eating food - it looks natural and will go away. That she can get tested which foods she doesn't digest well to reduce the bloating. That she is beautiful the way she is and not defined by how flat her tummy is. By cooking together and reminding her of how much she used to love good food. She sees a psychologist once in a while so I have encouraged her to go talk to that professional as well, since they are more likely to be able to help her than I am. 
She is aware that those are dark, destructive thoughts but that doesn't stop her from thinking them. 

So my question is, what else can I do? I would love to just reach into her brain and make those thoughts go away but I can't and I am so afraid that this will get even worse. How can I help her?

My gf has a history of disordered eating. She has never been diagnosed with a specific disorder but she spent years in high school and college restricting and working out obsessively. After college she worked with a therapist and she is now 'recovered' in the sense that she doesn't engage in any behaviours like skipping meals, restricting calories, etc. However she still has a lot of very disordered attitudes to food and weight and how she thinks about herself. She has a very distorted view of her body. (I hate to use these terms but I need to in order to fully explain the issue) She is plus size as am I. 

Since being in lockdown she tells me she has gained some weight. I have also along with almost everyone I know. She is having a really hard time with this and keeps saying she is fat and that she 'never wants to eat again.' She often tries to pass these comments off as jokes. As far as I know she is still eating in the same way she usually does although of course I can't be 100% sure because I'm not there physically. I don't know how to respond when she says things like this. Should I tell her she isn't fat? I haven't done this because I feel like she will just see this as a lie, she knows she is plus size obviously. I also don't want her to feel that I have an issue with 'fatness', that I don't want her to be 'fat', and that if she did gain more weight that I would care or not be attracted to her any more. A few times I have tried to push back against these comments, not by saying she isn't fat but by trying to challenge that this is anything to do with her worth, whether I will still be attracted to her, etc. but this just makes her double down. This doesn't surprise me, of course rationally she knows that there is nothing wrong with being any particular weight but she can't control how she thinks about herself.

432,EDPostRequests,1591092538,gv4mbh,"Hello all, maybe this isn't the ""perfect"" subreddit for this, but knowing my history with EDs and eating, I thought that this would be the appropriate place to ask.

So, I have been having problems with EDs since I was around 14 (now I'm almost 21) because my mother kept saying I had to lose X amount of weight before people could consider me pretty or date-able and other things not so nice.

I have been battling with over eating and under eating, going from binging to starving to binging again, never really settling for normal eating habits, gaining and losing weight like a yo-yo even if I'm supposed to be an adult now and have found my ""adult weight"".

The problem is that I ""knew"" those phases: I knew that while starving myself I would keep on thinking about what food I would be allowed the following day, and I knew that when I was binging I would obsess over the food I could not eat while starving. Even if I was completely out of control, it felt like I had control over what I was eating. I was eating because I wanted, I wasn't eating because I didn't want, even if the reasons behind it were completely nonsensical and related to something I could not control. It was familiar, going from one phase to the other.

However, as things are now, I just have no interest in food. I eat what mother cooks for dinner and even then it's difficult to chew and swallow, and I leave most of the meal in my plate. I recognize it doesn't taste bad, but I have absolutely no interest in it. Even things I would eat when I was on campus for college because I loved them, now don't seem appealing in the least.

When I get hungry, I still go to the kitchen to look at what is in the fridge and pantry, but there's nothing that seems to be interesting enough for me to eat, so I go back to doing whatever I was doing before.

I’ve been at a stable point in my recovery for quite a while now, maybe one and a half years completely symptom free. I’ve slowly gained up until this point, and after a recent minor weight gain, I realized I’m back at my pre-disorder body size (if not a tiny bit larger). 

This realization sickens me. In the past few years while I was at slightly lower weights, I found that I could at least take comfort that I wasn’t at my HW and still had a somewhat slim, or at least average body size. Now I am above average in weight for my height, which appears to be my body’s happy place (as it was my healthy pre disorder weight). I’m feeling that the small amount of positives recovery gave me do not come close to the negatives I’m experiencing in returning to this body size - namely the disgust I have for my self and body. 

Ideally I want to push through and not lose all the weight I worked so hard to regain. I seem to be stuck, and my therapist and I are kind of at a roadblock in trying to figure out how to help me with this. I guess the idea is that as one recovers and weight restores, your brain catches up with your body size eventually and the feelings of disgust are supposed to kind of plateau or decrease, but this isn’t the case for me.

438,EDPostRequests,1590958197,gu6plj,"so i‘m at the beginning of coming to terms with me having an eating disorder/ distorted eating habits. 
i really try to reflect on my actions and my thought processes when i‘m starting to feel like the topic of weight/ eating/ self-hate is taking over my train of thoughts. 

today i realized i get triggered when somebody (sadly mostly women) talk about their eating - especially when they mention that they didn‘t eat alot or at all that day.

so i was spending time with my boyfriend at his place when his flatmate came home from work.
she mentioned that she had a hard working day and then paused for a moment until she said kinda suprised that she didn‘t eat all day.
she is skinny and i feel really bad about my weight and looks when i‘m around her. 

she talked about her not eating all day before and i have to admit i got jealous that she was able to not eat all day while i feel like i‘m binging all day.
i also tried to talk to her about my strange eating or my worries about my eating habits and she answered: „if you‘re really unhappy with your weight you would just start working out more and just eat healthier.“

This hurt me a lot because i didn‘t feel like taken seriously and also felt like that - she as a skinny person with a figure that‘s in line with our society‘s body standard - doesn‘t really know how i feel with all my struggles.
so when she mentions that she didn‘t eat i feel disgusted by myself that i ate.

 in my mind it goes like: oh, if you would just stop eating you would look better too. she looks great and didn‘t eat. you did it. you look so disgusting. you‘re weak. just stop eating and you‘ll feel better.

my boyfriend and her were expecting guests later (also friends of mine) and i said before that i‘d eat dinner with them. but after her comments i told my boyfriend that i needed some time alone and that i‘d eat at my place and would come over later. 
at home i had a binge eating episode and now i‘m crying and looking for some kind of comfort...

i also feel like my boyfriends flatmate doesn‘t really think about the fact that her comments on her eating habits is affecting me. on the other side i don‘t think i really was able to tell her what‘s going on in my mind when i‘m struggeling with my eating habits/ my weight/ my look so i‘m not angry at her.

I (21 F) really struggled during the start of quarantine with my disordered eating, which I hadn’t done for years, but the lack of routine and constant jokes about ‘quarantine weight’ make me super anxious to put on weight. For almost ten weeks I tracked every calorie, exercised excessively, lost a lot of weight etc. Now, however, I’ve found my redemption in the same thing I did all those years ago, and have managed to reframe my mind to view food as something that will give me nutrition and strength for my yoga and cardio (it used to be weight lifting, but obviously there’s no gyms open). I’ve put the scales in the cupboard and deleted my tracking app (big step) but I’m now worried about staying healthy and eating nutritional foods without relying on an app to tell me exactly what’s in it etc.

So i want to preface by saying she wants to get better, but hasn't been making an effort at all recently, it feels like she is spiraling and no matter what approach we have to helping her (sympathetic, supportive, tough love) nothing helps. 
She grew overweight and immensly unhappy just over 2 years ago in the summer of 2018, becoming heavier and greedier and more irritable. She reached a point near the beginning of last year, 2019 january time, where she lost weight, and became critically underweight. At this point she hated food altogether, was again immensly unhappy, mainly because becoming skinnier didn't please her as much as she thought it would and she was still just as self concious. 

She has now gained a large amount of weight, again, and it came to a point where we have to hide biscuits and chocolates/various other foods locked in cuboards so she doesn't eat them all in a day. 
She keeps saying things such as ""I'll be happier when im skinnier"", ""i hate the way i look"", ""i will be forever lonely""(-this links to her being asexual and believing no one will love her or want to be with her as she doesn't want sex/ cannot provide that need). 
I think this may stem from low self esteem, all our siblings and parents suffer from that and various  (very present but not extreme) mental illnesses.

She will eat a very minimal amount of food at mealtimes, but will hide away and eat snacks all through the day (including spitting out a large amount of snacks, so she can have the flavour but not the calories, such as peanut butter or chocolate etc). A lunch will consist of one small egg, one slice of bread cut up and some lettuce. Lettuce/cucumber/spinach will take up a huge portion of her plate no matter the meal. For tea? A small quorn fillet, carrots. 

We are at a loss- she started getting help from a place which dealt with eating disorders, when asked to keep a food diary for a number of weeks, she didn't. She must make an effort or the organisation won't help, its NHS related and so not paid for directly out of our pocket, they have a large number of patients and can't afford to chase after ones who may need them but won't make minimal effort. This is elevated by the fact that if she were underweight, and at greater risk of per say death, the response and help she would recieve would be far greater. 

I desperately want to help her but i don't know how. I am scared for her when she moves out, as she has addictive behaviours and will not help herself. It is frustrating and painful living with her, as we all don't know how to help and she gets incredibly defensive if we talk to her about it. (It being the overeating/binging, as well as spitting food out into cups- disgusting smell if you havent experienced it before, her future flatmates would not enjoy it.)

Extra points:
- she has what we can only assume is acid reflux, no doctor can confirm what causes burning reactions to certain foids in certain phases of time so we don't even know what she can/can't eat

- despite this^, she is consuming the more 'tasty' things which a reflux patient shouldnt consume, such as carbonated drinks, dairy chocolate, ignoring things healthier such as milk, tomatoes, and won't make as much of an effort to eat them/make progress against reflux

- she is aneamic, as am i, we both have low blood pressure and lack of iron, feeling dizzy a lot

i really don’t know what it will take to sort this, i tried not calorie counting at all and ended up eating mindlessly for the entire day (although ironically i didn’t end up going over my limit). i’m supposed to be getting referred to mental health services for another reason and will probably bring this up as well, but i have no idea when it will be. i wish i could just get a new brain or something so i could refresh my entire mindset on food :/

i somewhat feel like even if i could control my eating habits, i sort of feel like i don’t want to? like i could just not go and eat more food, but i’m also not trying that hard to stop myself. i hope that makes sense and doesn’t sound like i’m not being serious

Hi everyone, I hope everyone is safe and well.

I found this reddit so I'm kinda thankful and I'm kinda hopeful if I could maybe get some advice for something.

Im 24 female..
I haven't been diagnosed with any eating disorders just now I'm trying to see a specialist but with covid still a thing it's a little tricky.

So I guess I should talk about what's going on... At age 11 I found food so repulsive.. I would feel sick at the thought of food and it was like that up until age 20, I was really really skinny.

It all changed and I don't know how I would have days where I would just eat and eat and eat non stop... Then almost go back to normal eating well normal to me.. Then I would eat nothing for days on end almost make myself so ill I would just sleep.


Right now eating doesn't feel like just just eating it feels like an urge... Its constant its always in my head and the thoughts won't shut up till I start to binge again. I constantly feel guilty about eating food, thinking about it, even when I'm eating somewhat normal.. It depresses me so much I just sit and cry all the time.

I keep trying diets because I have put allot of weight on.. I can't even take pictures anymore I never look in a mirror and I shower with the light off.. Because I get so triggered if I see any part of my body..


Im sorry if this triggers anyone I just need advice on what to do because I feel so helpless..
I have even stopped any possibilities to meet up with my friends after lock down.


I don't wanna be like this but I can't control it anymore.

It’s been a couple months and we know how to give space while in the same apartment and we’re not sick of each other or anything. The only issue im having is that we have different preferences as to when we eat and how much we eat. We’ve been eating our first meal in the early afternoon and a second meal later at night and that’s it. This is how he normally eats but not me but it works well for our schedules. I also eat smaller portions bc I feel full after a lot less than him but this has led me to feel super hungry in the morning and between meals. 

To give some background as to why I don’t just ask to change how we eat / tell him I’m hungry:
I had an eating disorder at the end of high school that I never really told anyone about or got help for. I was bulimic but I didn’t think I was because I don’t throw up every time I ate and I felt happy with life in general. I stopped for the most part when I went to college because sharing a bathroom and throwing up a lot doesn’t work very well and I naturally lost a lot of weight from being more active and having less time to eat.

I haven’t consistently thrown up in a while but I’ve done it time to time (once every couple months) if I over eat and feel guilty. 

I don’t consistently feel insecure about my weight like I used to but I have a little fat on my lower stomach that makes me insecure and one time my bf like jiggled it with his hands when we were in the shower. I reacted by saying I didn’t like that and he said he thought I was beautiful and was in no way trying to point out a flaw he just wasn’t thinking. But it made me really paranoid that I was noticeably overweight and that he may see me as heavier than I think I am.

I felt this a before this happened but more so now, but I feel like if I tell him I’m hungry or want to eat it makes me look overweight or like I like to eat a lot or it will make him afraid that I’m gonna gain weight. I don’t know what to do. Do I tell him about my past with and ED?

I'm 19, ftm transgender, I have been really skinny all my life but when puberty started I gained weight ""in the wrong places"". My dysphoria (cause feminine fat distribution and stuff) got worse and I started to restrict in order to get really underweight to feel more comfortable. I can't come out or start transitioning because I'm not entirely independent from my family yet, if I could transition I might not have this problem at all.

There's other aspects too. I want to see how low I can go, I like that I don't feel when I'm not eating, it's exciting. I guess it's also a form of self harm or suicide. It's thrilling in a way. It's the only way I feel somewhat comfortable in my body and when I don't feel as depressed and actually don't think about kms constantly. It's scary how thin I am but I love it on the other hand.

I have to choose certain methods (restricting, fasting, overexercising, sometimes purging) in order to stay at the low weight I'm at rn. Those methods are the only thing I think I have in common with people who have an eating disorder.

My mindset seems different and that's why I'm so confused. I've seen so many people talk about how they don't deserve to eat or that they feel overweight.
I deserve to eat, it's not a form of punishment, I don't really mind that much what I look like when I'm my normal weight, I'm not afraid of food (I just avoid it because it's so much work to get back to a low weight when I gain). 

Sometimes when I have eaten more than I wanted, the next day before I weigh myself I'm sure I can see that I have gained but after I weigh myself and the number hasn't changed I can see that I haven't gained at all. I know how skinny I look tho, I don't see myself as fat at all. There are just individual things that look a bit bigger or too feminine for my liking. I don't think that this is dysmorphia but Idk what it is tbh.

I've been in and out of this. There are months where I stop restricting (but there are foods I still eat in moderation) and then go back to my usual (slightly underweight) weight but I always end up restricting again. With every time I go back to restricting I get more strict with myself and get lower than the time before. This is the worst time this far. I've never been this skinny, let alone this skinny for this long. 

I'm sure recovery will be easy for me but I've struggled with this for the last three years and I'm afraid that I'm lying to myself.

I felt like I could finally wear clothes that showed skin and felt comfortable in them. I felt confident, more so than I’d ever been in my life.

I'm a 16 y.o. girl and currently a healthy weight.

All my other teammates were very thin and had stereotypical runner bodies. I was a bit chubby growing up, and I'm somewhat curvy now, or at least more so than my friends and my teammates. Now I'm scared of losing my fitness which I had due to intense training for my sport, and also I just want to lose some weight because I wish some parts of my body were thinner.

Even when the app I'm using to track calories says that I'm below the minimum healthy amount, I get some sick kind of satisfaction from that? I've only been doing it for about two weeks, but it's shockingly easy and now I can't imagine not caring about calories the way I used to. I've always been a bit of an overachiever. Like, I only get straight As in school and I always ran under my goal times in track practice, so I can see how maybe this is just my personality?

Does this apply if I was slightly overweight before I developed an ED? I truly do not think my pre-ed weight is my set point at all. I say this because all the women in my family are naturally thin, and when I was at my heaviest before my ED I had very unhealthy food habits. I was a freshman in college so I was drinking all the time, going to get fast food very often, no concept of portion control and would eat several dishes from the dining hall per meal. You get the idea. Therefore it seems crazy to me that I would have to gain past this weight in recovery.

I should also mention I developed my ED two years ago but only engaged in serious eating disorder behaviors for like 4 months. And I was never underweight, at my lowest I was still a very healthy normal weight. After those 4 months I stopped restricting as much and began eating what I thought was maintenance calories. I no longer lost weight. I was able to maintain a normal weight very easily with little effort, I went out to eat with friends and had no issues ordering dessert, etc. So I have been eating a decent number of calories for like a year now. And I experienced extreme hunger back then and dealt with it by giving in and eating a lot. Now I am eating more (the typical number recommended in recovery) because I haven't gotten my period back and I know I can only get it back by eating a lot.

So based on this info do you guys think I would still have to gain to my pre-ed weight to get my period back? I truly think my set weight is somewhere between my pre-ed and my lowest weight.

470,EDPostRequests,1591471216,gxx71r,"I apologized for the length of this post. For some background, I am 27f, and have struggled with an eating disorder for 11 years. When I switched doctors a few years ago, from my childhood doctor to the doctor that I have now, I received a formal diagnosis of anorexia and did see an intern for therapy for six months. Otherwise, I've not had any other treatment. 

About four years ago, I started a new job, alongside a few other new hires. One of the other new hires, 50f, and I instantly clicked. She was very kind and seemed so wise. I felt like she had my back at work and I trusted her. We did things outside of work all of the time, and it felt nice to have a friend, as eating disorders can be very isolating. 

After some time, this coworker expressed concern about my eating habits and wanted to know if I was okay.  I decided that it would be okay to let her in. I shared everything with her, and I mean everything. She encouraged me to switch to a doctor who could help me, and she even went with me to my first appointment. For the first time in a while, I really felt like I was in control of my eating disorder and that I could get better. 

A few months later, an extra leadership position opened up at work and I really wanted to apply for it. It wasn't much, and the raise it offered was very small, but I wanted to do it. I was transparent in that I let my coworker know that I planned on applying. When it was known to everyone that I did get the position, that was when everything changed. My coworker cornered me alone and was very upset that I had gotten the position over her. She said that I didn't deserve it, and she threw back everything I had ever confided in with her as the reasons why I shouldn't have gotten it. I apologized because I didn't know she wanted it too. I was devastated. I didn't know what to do, so I just avoided her for a while in the hopes that she would cool off and that things would go back to normal. 

After that incident, many people at work confronted me with accusations of an eating disorder, saying that they had heard things. My coworker had told anybody who would listen about all of the things I had told her about my eating disorder. Some people were concerned when confronting me, but a lot of them were angry too, like I had purposefully kept it a secret from them. I just denied everything until people finally stopped asking. It was and has been extremely embarrassing. Though I have an eating disorder, I believe I'm a hard worker, and I always get my work done. 

However, it has really made work a painful place to be. I still have to work with this coworker, and she just acts like nothing ever happened. She still tries to talk about personal things, but I shut it down and do not discuss anything but work related things. I feel like I am completely isolated. I just try to do my job and go home, but I dread going back each day. Absolutely dread it. I stopped seeing the intern for therapy sessions shortly after and have been avoiding my doctor, because I just feel so stupid and I feel like I can't tell anyone else anything more about myself.

So about a month ago I decided to commit to getting my life back from the grips of AN B/P subtype.. at first it was exciting and I was really motivated and enjoying having a bit more energy and positivity however after the second week I felt like I’d become a bottomless pit of hunger and just couldn’t stop eating. I felt like I was bingeing and it was TERRIFYING for me and after a couple weeks of that it became a lot more difficult to motivate myself.  Restriction crept back in, although not in its entirety; skipping meals here and there, stopping before I was full, leaving out this or that because in my head I know it has more calories or is a scarier food choice or I see it as “unnecessary”...

I’m trying to not skip anything, but I guess I really didn’t realise exactly how difficult this whole battle is.. literally a battle all day everyday with these incessant screaming voices in my mind.  I’m proud of myself or the amount I do it but I can’t keep doing this alone.

Although I have gained what - to me - is a lot of weight, I notice that even these small restrictions lead me to start feeling insanely weak, sluggish, cold, irritable, fatigued, and dizzy.  How is it that I can feel these same ways that I felt at a severely unhealthy weight just from skipping a meal or a snack??

So I've been recovering (successfully) for a while now. The subject body image and diets isn't interesting to me anymore. And I don't feel that emotional when it comes to this subject (for which I am grateful ,don't get me wrong).

But I remember that before I develop my issue with eating &amp; stuff ,I was quite an emotional person who would easily cry and had many feelings. I guess the reason why this whole thing became an issue is because I was such a sensitive person. But when eating and body image became an issue to me, I started to feel the most emotions in this subject. I cried alot because of it, I got angry because of it and I felt proud because of it. I guess this is the reason why it was so hard to get over this whole thing ,because it was a coping mechanism to which I was addicted to because I finally didn't cry over every little thing and life seemed easier. 

Now ,today ,I don't feel emotional about this issue anymore but I also don't feel emotional about life. There's barely anything that makes me cry. I don't feel much emotions. It's like I became an emotionless stone. And I'm wondering ,have I changed?
 Is this just the way that I'm becoming an adult? 
Or will I soon feel emotions again as much as I used to? Or am I not true to myself anymore?

My friend had very severe anorexia which peaked in fall/winter. She was told she could not do any form of exercise, not even walk stairs because her heart was so weak, it was really really bad. It got better in around january february and far as she told me and far as I can see, she was eating a regular amount of calories and eating pretty healthy. So happy to see it. 

Now, she has started decreasing her intake again. We just graduated last week, but in school she would not eat lunch, she would get food and poke around in it but not eat. She even cancelled plans when I said we would be eating dinner. Since it’s summertime which often is relapse time for anorexics, I really want to help her.

I think I had symptoms of disordered eating a while ago. This is what  happened, I grew up in a home where there was abuse and two years ago  decided to break all contact with my family, egged on by [r/raisedbynarcissists](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists).  I took a low paying job and struggled to cover my basic expenses while  also struggling with trauma and not being ready to be out on my own. I  wasn't there financially and also had grown up very ""spoiled"", except I  just had very uninvolved parents that never asked anything of us because  of their mental health issues, tbh.

Nothing was going well for me before or after I left. I got obsessed  over a guy, but thought that I was too damaged for a boyfriend and  wasn't on his level because of where I was in life. I started to hyper  control my food because I wanted one thing in my life to go well. I lost  like 10 kilos in a year. Never reached a ""bad"" BMI (I would have just  focused on getting the right number) but the way I was eating was  sucking the life out of me. Or rather, life was sucking the life out of  me and I hyper focused on my body to try to keep myself sane.  Ironically, it was all really unhealthy.

I was never obsessed with beauty. It wasn't about the way I looked.  It was a period in my life where I constantly compared myself to one  person in particular (my unrequited love's girlfriend) and felt ugly in  comparison, but overall, I was someone who ""knew"" you were supposed to  love your body no matter what you looked like. I didn't aspire to be  model thin. I did emulate the habits of certain online figures, telling  myself what I was doing was ""self-improvement"".

Because I often hear people blame eating disorders on the pressure on  women to look a certain way, I question whether I did have symptoms of  an eating disorder or not. I wanted to ask if any of you struggled with  disordered eating while not feeling as if you fell prey to ""the pressure  to be beautiful"". I've heard dogs and cats can get anorexia after a  loss, out of depression or due to trauma. And they obviously aren't  affected by women's magazines or the way models look. 

I think I'm someone who was vulnerable to the self neglect/self  injury that disordered eating implies because of the abuse and neglect I  experienced as a child. I learned when I was little to just ""take it"".  Hunger, a poor diet, verbal abuse, etc. I had to just force myself to  endure a lot of damaging things and as an adult, I was not able to keep  myself on track with taking basic good care of myself because I had  learned to just accept different forms of injury as a child. It was like  I'd been trained to keep my hand in the fire even while I got burned.  

I just wanted some insight into what fueled your ED and in particular  I wonder if any of you don't feel as if you were driven to look a  certain way or fit a certain beauty ideal. I thought of it as ""getting  fit"", because it was a ""life goal"" but told myself I didn't care what I  looked like as long as I was healthy.",Request: Can an eating disorder not be deeply tied up with beauty?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/h9fg4l/request_can_an_eating_disorder_not_be_deeply_tied/,1592246044,15-06-20 7:34

hello everyone, this is my first time here and I'm not going to get into specifics just for the anonymity of this person. but I know someone who had been struggling with bulimia since long before I met them. within the 2 years I've known this person, they have had quite a few episodes where they thought they had food poisoning and would vomit, mostly bile, but also have bad stomach pain and nausea as well as sweating quite a bit even though they are very cold.

Just for the record i have always told this person to go to the emergency room and get checked out and the first couple times they did but basically got an iv and was sent on their way. after a while they stopped going and decided to deal with it on their own, against my advice so I try to be there and help them through it by giving them moral support, getting water and Gatorade, just overall trying to do whatever I can to be supportive. (I know what its like as a child probably from the age of 6 to about 15/16 I struggled with stomach problems like that at least once a every month or 2 and the doctors didn't do much they thought I had crohn's disease but it eventually culminated with an appendectomy which basically solved the problem entirely). I'm still trying to convince them to go.

There is a little more, originally I thought it could have been an allergy to alcohol since coincidentally they drank each of those times, not much but at least 1 drink. after that they abstained from alcohol entirely and was episode free for a few months until today. However this time I was told they only ate food and got sick about 10 minutes afterwards which I think is too fast for food poisoning but I'm not a doctor. This got me thinking of well some underlying issues, but I am a hypochondriac especially with myself and the people I love, as well as appendicitis because I know how miserable that can be. Then there is the obvious issue with the bulimia (which I've always tried to help them with but as someone who hasn't really dealt with that in my life I dont know the best way to help), stress, and anxiety this person suffers from.

I know stress and anxiety can cause a wide range of issues. I'm really scared for them and only want them to feel better and not have to deal with this.

So I'm wondering if prolonged bulimia can result in these symptoms?

As well as any advice to best help this person recover from this disorder, I would greatly appreciate. Sorry for the long post but any help or conversations would help.

It was me, those were things I did, and it was haunting.

I had a dream last night that I was in college. I had a routine of eating once a day, maybe twice if I had an important test, and taking a five mile walk around the campus daily. It felt like I was chained, like I had no escape from this miserable, hypnotic day-to-day routine. I remember thinking about calories for almost the entire dream... at one point (random scene change) I was in my dorm and a girl tugged on my sleeve. I was wearing an oversized long-sleeve shirt and leggings. I didn’t recognize her face, but I recognized her voice as one of my closest friends irl. I asked her if she needed anything and she said she was worried. I asked her why, and she said that it looked like I was losing weight at an unhealthy speed. I got really flustered and tried to deny that, but then she held my wrist and wrapped her fingers around it and commented about how thin I had become. I got extremely embarrassed because I'm not used to being touched and managed to tell her that my wrists are just naturally small— she didn’t buy it. She tugged at my shirt from the side, which revealed the shape of my torso and the outlines of my bones like a silhouette. She didn’t have any words... she seemed shocked at just how thin I had become and asked me with tear-filled eyes what was going on. I started to tear up too, and in the moment I couldn’t decide if I wanted her to leave so I could go on with this lifestyle in whatever secrecy I had left or if I wanted her to hug me and tell me it would be okay. Then I woke up.

I know that this was me in the past. I know that I have more control now. But I haven't gotten over the sick mentality that the number on the scale defines me. I haven't gotten over the mentality that the number of calories that I eat per day defines me.

I'm at the point in recovery where I could easily fall back into old habits. But I don't want to... I want to try to achieve a balance. This dream almost pushed me over to the dark side and I don't know how to deal with this. I don't know if I can get through this myself, but I don't want to talk to my therapist or my family.

So I’ve struggled w my weight since I was in middle school. I was never really super overweight or had health risks, my mom just wasn’t around to cook meals so I often had to prepare stuff for myself which led to some bad habits. My dad would also always tell me I didn’t “have the shape” to wear things like shorts and that I was a “bigger girl” when I was really just average/“chubby” with big boobs which are genetic. I would go through cycles of what in hinds’ sight was probably binging and restricting starting around 14. I would count calories and exercise excessively then rest for days and binge again and rinse repeat, but at the time I thought I was just having “off days.” This continued through high school but I never thought of it as an eating disorder because I didn’t lose a lot of weight and never tried to puke more than once or twice.

High school and college were a little better but I still felt “bigger” and would count calories and exercise a lot then binge and just call those days “cheat days.” Then I started my first desk job after college which was very intense and left me mostly sedentary and with no time to exercise except on the weekends. I gained about xx lbs in 9 months which was very noticeable imo in my face, arms, and stomach, although only my mom ever said anything about it and my doctor, who said I could “stand to lose xx lbs.”

I just lost all that weight after a year , and since quarantine started I’ve been fasting and doing intuitive eating. I was exercising an hour every day and I’ve not been eating til around 2, not for any restrictive reason, that’s just when I seem to get hungry. I don’t have a scale so I only weigh myself at the doctor but when I found out I’d lost the weight at my last appt I was so happy and felt even more encouraged w keeping up this intuitive eating and exercise regimen bc of the way it was making me feel.

A few weeks ago though I had surgery and when I went for my post op I had gained a few pounds. You would think this would make me keep my diet in check, but instead my thoughts have been “I have to get these desserts out of my house,” and so instead of just treating myself and eating a little every day I’ve been binging on 3/4 a ben and Jerry’s carton or half a thing of cookies every day to get rid of this stuff. Why am I doing this if I know it’s counterintuitive? What should I do differently?

I’m curious about if a eating disorder can be present without body image issues? 

So I have always been incredibly nauseous in the mornings, since I can remember I wake up feeling queazy. Sometimes I lose my appetite for a week at a time. During which time food turns my stomach when I try to eat. I have been to several doctors throughout my life, spent a small fortune on medical bills searching for the cause both during my childhood and adulthood. I’m an American so medical tests are not cheap. Anyways the Doctors can’t figure it out and a few have suggested Anorexia Nervosa as the cause, citing my CPTSD. 

CPTSD is due to a traumatic neglectful childhood. I’m guessing it’s possible that I never “learned” how to eat properly since my home environment was crazy growing up. I would “steal” snacks at night when my parents were asleep. My mom constantly accused us of being “fat” but I’ve never been overweight.  

I’m happy with my body and mostly wish I could GAIN a bit of weight and figure this stupid morning nausea thing out. I would like to eat breakfast like a normal human and not puke as often. 

I guess I am wondering if I could have learned a eating disorder from my less than perfect childhood? Or if it’s possible to have Anorexia Nervosa without the desire to be thin, or lose weight? 

I’m happy to pull my therapist into the mix, she has helped me achieve great results in other areas of my life. I’m just having trouble shaking a few things.

-been nauseous with a bad appetite my whole life. From infancy on, sometimes it’s bad sometimes it’s worse. Can something like that start that early?

-no body image issues (I love my body, just want less discomfort)

-no desire to lose weight or watch calories or diet

Hey guys,

I'm 32, male, and my gf (28) and I have been dating for 2 months officially.

I knew she has a eating disorder / body dismorphia from the beginning.
A few years ago she became super thin, so thin it was beyond unhealthy.
She somehow managed to gain weight and maintain a healthy weight until now.
Now she weighs more than ever, which is kinda her problem.
Her weight is absolutely normal and healthy - nobody would say that she needs to lose or gain weight. 
Yes she has a small belly and some fat here and there but she's far from being too fat or even chubby.

If she's not with me which ist throughout the week, she doesn't eat the whole day and only eats in the evening, which won't help her losing weight. We both know that.

Every unplanned meal before evening is a struggle for her and she always stressed out thinking about lunch with friends or eating something at work at gatherings etc.

She's very active, cycles a lot, swims and goes to the gym regularly. Her stamina is way better than mine 😅.
There's rarely a day she takes off, but if she does, she stresses out about it.

Long story short she's always stressed about her either being too lazy  and not doing enough or eating too much.

Her mind is pretty occupied by all of that.

I don't judge her for that and I don't blame her for anything, I just want to be there for her, support her and make her feel better.

I just can't quite get through to her because her thoughts have too much power over her.

I assume this is a self esteem issue and that those thoughts stem from a deeper lying root cause.

I have a history of mental issues as well but I managed to start to rewire my brain by being aware of my thoughts and practice mindfulness a lot.

I know how it feels to not be content with your own body and how that can make you feel bad which ends in a vicious circle.

I'm just kinda helpless helping her. Helping me was easier because I have the power over my mind but not hers.

So I came here to ask for advice how to support her and help her long term making progress with her problem.

Where do I start and how did you guys make progress? 

Another important thing is I can never make her to go to therapy. She tried that and didn't like that at all / didn't find the right therapist to click with and going to another one is definitely out of question for now. 

I want her to be happy and I want us to be happy, so you might give me some tools how to handle the whole situation.

I have always had body image issues, but it wasn’t until around 7th grade that I learned how much control I have over what I eat and how I look. I was prescribed Adderall at the time, and that essentially kick started what was going to be a 10 year journey with an eating disorder. 

I’m 23 now, and my health is at a low point. I still use Adderall to manage my weight, and somehow it allows me to eat more because I see the lack of appetite side effect as a crutch. Before that, I was eating very little calories a day and barely having the energy to get through a four hour work day. Between ignoring my hunger cues and eating less, or taking Adderall and eating more because I feel more in control without hunger, I had to pick the lesser of two evils. 

Due to my extremely high blood pressure my doctor is no longer writing me prescriptions for Adderall, so I’m now left with no choice but to stop taking it. Hearing that triggered me because I’m worried I’m gonna resort back to my old meal plan due to being scared of my hunger cues.

My sister has struggled with anorexia since high school and is now 20. She is home with us due to the pandemic. She has been doing great for the past year but has begun to relapse again. Recently, we found out that she ordered a scale and has been weighing herself multiple times a day. I know that scales are extremely harmful for people with EDs and I don’t want her to get into that mindset again- it’s like letting her keep a bunch of drugs in the basement with her and not batting an eye. So should I take the scale away, or is that overstepping? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!


Also, I’m wondering how I should handle this as a whole as her little sister. When this happened before, I was around 14 so was still too young to truly understand or step in. However, since I’m 17 now I feel like it should be more of my responsibility. She has a lot of friends and all of them are very concerned right now, so I’m not sure how much more there is to express or how much more I can do. She’s isolated herself from them because they’re upset, meaning that the time we spend together watching a TV show or something is probably her only sense of normalcy or a way to make her laugh. I don’t want her to think that I’m okay with it or enable her in any way but I also don’t want her to be completely alone and not have anyone to do normal things with if that makes sense?? I think she knows I’m concerned and I’ve kind of expressed that before but I think I might be being too nice to her or too gentle in a way that’s enabling. I really struggle with empathy and picking up on social cues so I have no idea how to go about this and I’m scared that if I do I won’t understand and will mess up and make things worse like I feel I already have by not doing enough. Because of my social issues I feel like she also views me as a lot younger than I actually am and I’m not sure how to breach that since I don’t think I appear mature when I talk to her and I don’t want her to feel condescended.

i hate myself wearing short clothes or a bathing suit.
Every year i buy new summer clothes, just to hate myself after wearing them once in public, sometimes i don‘t even make it to that point.

I still wear a hoodie as often as i can and always walk around with leggings underneath my skirt, because i hate my legs so much.
I even can‘t give up the legwarmers i wesr throughout the colder seasons because otherwise i feel like my legs look like fucking triangles. 
It gets this bad that i check the weather reports daily, just so i know when i‘m avoiding the outsides.

My boyfriend wants to go swimming soon because he has never swum in the river before but i dread the day we decide to do it.

This is long, skip to the last paragraph if you want.

I'm overweight, and not just a little overweight, a *lot* overweight. I haven't been skinny at all since i was probably 8 years old. I always knew that I was ""different"" from the other girls my age, they were always so small and then there was me. It didn't really bother me until I got older, probably around 12-13. When I was 15 I weighed myself for like the first time ever and since then – I'm 20 now – weight has been a struggle and a curse in my life. 

I've never had a full on eating disorder like most of you. I remember googling about it a few times, like what would happen if I just...didn't eat. What I read scared me so I never tried it. I dealt with some purging at one point, but I ended up stopping because I was scared my teeth would fall out. The only reason I knew about purging was because my mom used to do it sometimes, I remember when we would eat ice cream on the way home from town and then we would stop at a grocery store and she would go into the bathroom and throw up. I didn't think a lot of it honestly, I just didn't understand. 

For the past month I've been calorie counting. I just picked a random number that wasn't too high and went with that. I usually didn't even hit it on most days. In the first two weeks I lost about 9 pounds. After some people warned me that it was actually too little calories, I upped it. And I **hate** it. I feel like I'm eating way too much even though I know I'm not. I know I will lose weight this way just fine. 

But I felt like I had more control before. I want to go back to it. I see these girls on here (not this sub) and twitter and tumblr who's start weight was close to mine and they talk about how they've lost all this weight in 3, 4, 5 months because they restrict calories. They show their before and after photos and I want to be that. And I'm like, I could be that if I just did what they're doing. And I think, sure, it's not the healthiest way but...they did it, why can't I? I know you feel sick and it's not good for you. I'm fat as hell but when I was eating that small amount at first I noticed how I seemed to get cold easily and I had headaches a lot. But none of the warnings seem to even matter to me, part of me wants to be that sickly girl who people worry about. And these other girls did it, so surely I can as well.

I want to high restrict, it's on my mind every day. I think about how fast I could lose weight like that. And yeah I might be sick but I'll be seeing progress every day and wow...isn't that worth feeling terrible? And it terrifies me that I'm becoming this way, that it's occupying my every thought.

Would like to get the community’s thoughts on something. Im in the healthy weight range but I’m always looking to lose weight. In my head every-time I look in the mirror I feel fat..

A few months ago I started putting on weight even though I had made no changes to my diet and exercise. I started to restrict my calorie intake and practically starve myself however the pounds still kept adding up. I had to starve myself the whole day to maintain the same weight. Eventually it got too much for me.. this voice in my head was constantly screaming at me to eat something. One day I gave in and started binging on a lot of food and alcohol two hours later after the haze had lifted I realised I had over eaten. I was guilty, ashamed and I felt terrible. The next day the scale said I had put on a couple of pounds just one night of bingeing so I stared to starve myself again... but to no avail. The vicious cycle continued for a few months I would binge eat and try to starve myself the next day but it wouldn’t help at all! Eventually I stopped starving myself and a series of binge eating episodes continued. I wouldn’t even eat a lot just the recommended number of calories and I’d still put on weight! I was miserable I felt fat and ugly I avoided mirrors like the plague my self esteem was at the lowest point and I had locked myself in the house.

A few weeks later I had the sense to book an appt with an endocrinologist and I got diagnosed with pcos all the weight I was gaining was water weight. I’m on meds now back to my diet to lose excess weight and the voice in my head is still screaming for me to eat more but it’s under control now... I still think I’m fat and ugly and I hate looking at myself in the mirror... it almost feels like a sickness.

Since March I’ve been stuck at home with my family and had a binge purge relapse of sorts and then began to restrict again up until now where my moms found out again, we’ve had another talk about it and she said she just wants me to be ‘normal’.

I feel like hell physically all the time. I feel weak and dizzy doing just about anything, but I'm not losing weight rapidly, sometimes I maintain my weight or gain a pound. (I weigh myself once a monthish)

I do admit I have concerning habits like trying to take the scale to my room so I can weigh myself whenever, I immediately want to throw up when I do eat, but I can't seem to make myself even if I try, and I try to go as long as possible without eating constantly. But that's never more than a day and half or so. 

On Saturdays I go have lunch with my grandpa, and I eat just fine then. I still struggle with the concept of I'm eating and the calories will add up though. 

I've never been able to consistently keep track of my calories, but I try to aim for about 800 when I do. 

I really don't like the proana community, but I find myself following their diet plans and admiring their bodies. I don't exercise though, the most I do is walk once a week or so if the weather is nice. When I do walk though I walk until I'm on the verge of collapsing. I really can't tolerate any other exercises.

If this makes any difference, I am deficient of multiple vitamin and minerals. My thyroid doesn't produce enough hormones so I have to take medication which I have to change a lot. When my thyroid is off and my meds aren't working I tend to gain weight. I don't think I can blame my thyroid for my weight though. 

When I do eat, it's garbage junk food. I grew up in a bad environment and for some reason one of my many anxieties was the food I ate. I wasn't just picky, I was genuinely afraid of trying new foods. I used to skip meals if it even had touched a food I didn't already feel safe with. I'm still anxious about new foods, but nowhere near the level I was then.

Quickly recapping over the past 2 years now, I went through a really hard time starving myself then it reversed last summer and I binge ate every day just to fall asleep so I wouldn’t be awake because the feeling was so terrible. I was not only in a hard battle with my eating and finding balance but I was mourning my mother (still am), along with a breakup. So it was terror to say the least it went straight to suicidal thoughts.

I am now a month away from my goal weight and I’m in a MUCH better place. But you NEED to know I’m doing it healthily. Once you maybe meditate in your own way and let go of what you think needs to be and just jump into practicing balance it becomes SO much easier. Maybe even book a trip or something of the sort and use that as motivation to start (because I know that motivation is very hard to conjure up when battling an eating disorder). One of the hardest things in my eyes with an eating disorder is finding balance, coincidentally I struggle with balance in all areas of my life. The change starts with you but you must first push yourself through everything. I do have my bad days but I usually notice my bad days the second I wake up In the morning and if I’m not working, I’ll make some plans and be sure to eat something before and keep my mind busy through out the day.

Hi everyone,
For a year or two now I have been thinking about my relationship to food and my body. I have not been diagnosed with an eating disorder, but I suspect if I were honest with mental health professionals about my eating and purging habits, I would probably be. My behaviors are mostly around feeling physically uncomfortable if I feel full and feeling soothed by purging behaviors. I’ve been engaging in them since I was a child (I’m in my late 20s now). I’m relatively happy with how I look and I don’t think there’s a strong correlation between this and wanting to look a certain way. I’ve never talked about this directly to anyone and have managed to never get caught. 

I’m in therapy and I’m building up courage to talk to my therapist about my body issues. We have already touched on things that may be related to this: perfectionism , feeling overwhelmed because I can not control what is happening in my body and it feels unpredictable, anxiety, feeling out of control and feeling overwhelmed by my emotions and life in general. Much of this stems from childhood trauma and I realize that I’ve been seeking soothing through controlling and obsessive in different ways apart from with food/digestion related behaviours. 

What I would like to ask, to people who have managed to lessen purging/restrictive behaviors over time (months or years) or those who are recovered or in recovery, is how you were able to keep going if you relapsed. 

For years, I have periodically been trying to stop my behaviors completely, but what usually happens is that I might be successful for a week and then if I give in once, I feel like I will never recover, I feel ashamed and like I’ve failed and then I give up and continue the behaviors. I’m looking for perspectives on how to view “recovery” without the “all or nothing” kind of view I have of it. I feel so deeply ashamed of myself and I think the fact that I struggle to quit “cold turkey” is holding me back.I would really appreciate any story shares, resources, videos, etc. Thank you in advance.

I started binging and purging in 2011. I’ve been overweight my whole life, and I decided to really try to lose weight by exercising and tracking my food intake. One day, I had an intense craving for Chinese food. So, I bought some takeout and ate it. I was immediately overwhelmed with fear about destroying my progress, so thinking it was my only option, I forced myself to purge.

It’s been hard to come to terms with this. I’ve developed the courage to share this with my SO, and just recently, 3 of my closest friends. Over the years, I noticed my trigger is the combination of stress and loneliness. I am currently going through a rigorous academic program in a different state, away from my SO and support network. Additionally, I’ve gained all the weight I lost, so that adds a lot of extra stress - mainly, because it has contributed to chronic back pain and my clothes don’t fit.

I went to a counselor provided by my school because I want to get help. However, they were EXTREMELY unhelpful - discounting my feelings and suggesting that the only tried and true solution I needed was to lose weight healthily. I am a bit hesitant to try to seek professional help again.

Any advice to help with my situation?

Hi everyone. So I struggle with my relationship with food a bunch. I love good, but I also hate it because it’s like I have no control. It makes me feel weak, and like I lack will-power. I eat when I’m sad, when I’m anxious, when I’m bored, when I’m happy, and when I’m feeling nothing at all. Even if I’m not hungry, I’ll East just so I have something to do. This makes me absolutely miserable. I have always thought I had problems relating to food and eating, but no one had ever agreed with me or listened. I finally think it’s time for me to talk to someone, because I don’t think what I’m doing is normal (but I’m not sure) and I’m not sure who to go to. Can I speak to a primary care provider or must I go to a psychiatrist/psychologist.

(F/21) I have been suffering from Bipolar, Borderline for quite long, but was only recently diagnosed. Last year I started restricting food as a means of self-harm; I kept absolutely no single calorie for consecutive 5 days, and on the sixth I was forced to eat because I didn't want to raise suspicion when I come back home.

So things went quite stationary till I had to be hospitalized for a month in a psych hospital and in the meantime I was so scared of gaining weight due to lack of movement that I restricted on carbs and a minimum intake of proteins. I was xxkg when I was released which is a healthy body weight in BMI, however, it felt fat, so fat.

Months went and quarantine started, I had two kept issues in mind: first of all, I had a persistent feeling of being constipated which I have no clear idea whether it was a true feeling or not (that too I had since the hospital). Then second of all, I was extremely afraid of gaining weight. I started exercising so hard but it didn't pay off as much as I wanted it to, and although I lost around 4 kgs in three month I still wanted more. I was also binging from time to time and the feelings of guilt became greater that recently I started to overexercising to compensate. Again the results weren't satisfying so finally I resorted back to restriction.

I have been restricting for 2 weeks now with one binge in the middle. I just eat a little to keep those around me calm. I have had experience in advocating mental health, and read quite a lot, so I know anorexia usually hits younger. Also I am afraid my psychiatrist won't believe me since people with anorexia tend to keep it like a secret to themselves. Sorry for the ranting, but I feel down and confused.

sometimes i wonder if i was born with something in my brain that made it sick. i’m sure lots of young girls have negative thoughts about their appearance. how many 10 year girls have been teased about their arm fat on the playground? how many relive that memory 13 years later grasping their biceps and feeling an intense hatred for that girl on the playground? i think to myself so often there is something really wrong with my brain. 

fifth grade, the same year as the fat arm incident, we learned in health class that all us girls will be hitting puberty soon and with puberty comes weight gain. most girls were probably excited to grow boobs or get their periods. i remember thinking to myself, if i am ever not as skinny as i can be, i wouldn’t know how to live. i wouldn’t want to. 

in eighth grade i realized that no one watched me pack my lunch for school, and therefore no one could stop me from packing only a special k meal replacement bar for lunch. on the days i did have a lunch packed, no one could stop me from throwing it away once i got to school. 

in ninth grade i found the blogging website tumblr. i was a fragile, insecure, mentally unwell 14 year old with unlimited unsupervised internet access. almost immediately i became very drawn to these black and white blogs filled with photos of very thin girls. these girls were so beautiful, with long hair and fashionable clothes. many photos featured something i now know as body checking, where the girls wrapped their fingers around their wrist or their thigh to show how thin they are. i would try to mimic these behaviors and was very discouraged when i could not wrap my fingers around my thigh so easily. i began restricting my food intake much more, and when i was forced to eat more than i thought i should, i would purge. i became so entranced with this lifestyle. i checked calories on everything i ate and payed close attention to serving sizes. 

throughout high school i became increasingly dedicated to the “pro-ana” lifestyle. i followed work out plans, took freezing baths, took hot baths with my body covered in saran-wrap, bought green tea diet pills from the drug store, took laxatives, smoked cigarettes, filled up on coffee and water. i never noticed any changes in how i looked, i was too lost to see it. every time i reached my goal weight i already had a new one in mind. i was hospitalized 4 times in my 4 years of high school, the last being 4 months at a residential eating disorder hospital. i had to leave my high school, and my beloved school newspaper, and graduated from a small school on the campus of the hospital. 

my senior year of high school i got into a very toxic, at times abusive, relationship. when i graduated i went to live with her. neither of us had jobs or hobbies, but she was old enough to buy me alcohol and didn’t care how little i ate. i completely deteriorated in that house, mentally and physically. my only escape was my weekly psychiatrist appointment. he became increasingly concerned for my health with each meeting. it was friday the thirteenth when he told me he could not in good conscience let me go home. it was during that hospitalization where i learned i have a heart condition caused by my eating disorder. i fell asleep every night to the sound of feeding tubes. i cried because i wished my psychiatrist at least let me reach my goal weight before hospitalizing me, even if i knew deep down there was no goal weight that would make me happy with myself. i cried every day begging the doctors to send me home, telling them it’s pointless, my brain will never be better. eventually they listened. 

less than a month after i was released, i was back in the hospital. this time for self harm with suicidal intentions. at this point i was 19. i still didn’t want help. i refused to sign any paperwork so they sent me home 72 hours after i got there. i took the train home from the hospital by myself and wondered when the agony of being alive would finally end. 

after my back to back hospital stays i went back to living with my dad, like i was before i was drunk on an empty stomach with my abusive girlfriend every night. it felt good to be away from her. every morning my dad would greet me with a cold bottle of vanilla ensure, and sit at the kitchen table with me until i finished it. along with my weekly psychiatrist appointment i now also had a weekly weigh in with my primary care doctor. one time she was very busy so the nurse weighed me. no one gave her the memo not to tell me my weight. i was inconsolable. the next morning i purged after i finished my ensure. 

by the time i was 20, i didn’t need pro-ana blogs as a reference anymore, it was my lifestyle all on my own. i felt powerful and in control as my body continued to grow weaker. my girlfriend and her family moved away and i was so relieved. i broke up with her through text after over two years together, sighing with relief as i hit send. she never encouraged my eating disorder but also never acted like she cared at all. i didn’t even know i wanted to be with someone who cared. but i did.

during that summer i reached out to all the friends i had shut out during that relationship. i saw my best friend for the first time in about a year and we cried as we hugged each other. i slowly rebuilt my bridges. the most important bridge to rebuild turned out to be with c.

c was a friend who, ironically, i started talking to on tumblr when i was 15. he wasn’t a pro-ana blogger like me, just someone who saw my pain and wanted me to know i wasn’t alone. we became real life friends and i loved spending time with him, but like everyone else, i shut him out when things got bad. it had been years, so i wasn’t sure how he would feel hearing from me out of the blue. but he answered immediately and asked if he could come see me. it was midnight and i was drunk alone in my dad’s basement. he was there not even 15 minutes later. 

we stayed up all night talking about where life had taken us since we’d last seen each other. the years were a bit unkind to us both but it all let us to that night. 

he asked me to be his girlfriend exactly one year after my last hospital stay. 

i wish i could say that happiness cured my sick brain. i wish it was that easy. but i am taking baby steps away from my need for control. i forgot how much i enjoy mcdonald’s french fries until we had them together. when we were shopping for furniture for our apartment, he didn’t let me buy a scale for the bathroom. every day that he goes to work, he’ll text me saying “make sure you eat something.” it is a love language all its own, one i was never able to speak to myself.",Request: request: a self reflective essay i wrote,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/hj09f6/request_request_a_self_reflective_essay_i_wrote/,1593586658,30-06-20 19:57

I've never had a good relationship with food. I began counting  calories in middle school, and I haven't stopped. I was a chubby child  and had lots of skinny athletic friends. In Highschool it worsened. I  started working out, eating one meal a day, and I'm still counting  calories even when I try not to think about it. It escalated a lot in  quarantine when I began to have more free time. I dropped xx lbs in a  month. I told my mom a few days ago that I've been struggling to eat  full meals and she said that no one needs to eat whole meals. I tried  talking to her but this made me realize that she has been spurring these  bad habits for years, along with all my other family members who are  proud of me for being so skinny. I went out to eat with my friends today  and was unable to finish anything on my plate. All of my friends  struggle with the same thing so I know I'm not completely alone as they  offer support constantly, but right now they all have some control over  their food intake but I do not. I want to get professional help because  this is all so draining. My family thinks that nothing is wrong, they  are all convinced I'm healthy but always have to say something about how  skinny I am. But they are praising me and are not concerned in the  tiniest bit. I think I need a therapist or a doctor but I'm scared they  will also think everything is fine. I'm not underweight by any means but  my whole day revolves around food intake, I have to smoke marijuana so  that I can eat comfortably and that in turn has developed in an  addiction. I don't know what to do.","Request: Family thinks I'm OK, but I don't",https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/hj04ow/request_family_thinks_im_ok_but_i_dont/,1593586159,30-06-20 19:49

554,EDPostRequests,1593510562,hika5k,"Hi everyone, 
I don’t have a large following or anything but I enjoy making videos and for a while now I’ve wanted to make some videos around recovery. 
Bit of backstory of my own - I was diagnosed with anorexia when I was 19 (9 years ago now). I’ve been in treatment a bunch of times where I found little therapeutic benefit as far as my mental recovery went and now I’m very slowly recovering, mostly on my own (I have a psych I see online because I live far away and my gp weighs me and does bloods occasionally). 

So I don’t want to make anything that contributes to the unhealthy ways people sometimes talk about eating disorders. All the obvious topics that aren’t helpful, basically anything with numbers, will be off the table. 
I’m also really conscious about not wanting to share any photos or video of me at my lowest weight or in hospital etc as I sometimes feel that this is an unhealthy way of seeking validation or proving that we are ‘sick enough’ so as much as my disordered mind feels I need to prove that by sharing those thing I’m going to make a really conscious effort not too. I don’t think anyone needs to see very underweight bodies to raise awareness about anorexia. 

What I want to do is share the recovery journey as I go. I worried about doing this because I want to be a good role model while still being honest and I worried that not being ‘fully recovered’, I’m less useful than those women who are recovered and able to talk about it retrospectively so I wondered, to everyone on here - what do you think? 
Are there things you’d like to see someone talk about? 
Are there topics that you feel might be useful for others who are trying to recover? 
Are there things you think I need to be mindful of?

Does anyone else feel like there's not a great place/type of doctor who understands the long-term health consequences of eating disorders, and how to appropriately factor in your ED history to your current health concerns (i.e. not blame everything on your ED history so you don't feel heard - been there- but not ignore your ED history so things aren't overlooked)?

Does anyone have experience with a doctor that understood your concerns? Do they recommend testing every year, 2 years, 5 years...to check out your esophagus, heart, inflammation levels, hormonal health, etc? All of this was out of wack/damaged during ED, and sometimes I think I can still feel those effects. I'm 4 years into recovery- maybe it keeps gets better?

I am also very aware of what I put my mental energy, and this has been a successful long-term recovery tactic for me. So I don't want to obsess over the damage I may have caused, but I don't want to turn a blind eye to the real possibility of developing something like esophageal cancer, or having done permanent damage to heart valves (last time these were tested was \~10 years ago).

If you've dealt with an ED, I'm sure you can emphathize with the idea that we are really good at ignoring warning signs from our body. So while I truly try to listen and be in tune now, I am also aware that my natural instinct is to ignore symptoms and rationalize that they aren't that bad (I have done this with colds and injuries in recovery). I believe people affected by EDs are a unique mixture of fragile, and tough as GD s\*\*t. One of my worst fears is not catching something serious in time because I rationalized it away (ironic that this behavior/coping mechanism is also rooted in fear).

Advice? Success stories with doctors dealing with this? Preferably doctors who take insurance and not specialty docs who don't :)

Thanks in advance - haven't explored this community much but I think if someone channeled all of our (ED sufferers) energy into something, we could save the f-in world. Society tries to distract us from our power. I've met the most amazing women though ED treatment and recovery.

I’ve been overweight as a child and as a teen I now fit on the heavier side of “normal weight” for my age group and size. Because of this I’ve never accepted my body starting from about 8 years old. Throughout my tween years stress &amp; my first boyfriend lead me to undereating, and the few following years I coped with the feeling of hunger through drugs (which I’ve now stopped.) I then went vegetarian &amp; began eating as much as I wanted under the notion that everything I ate was healthier if it was mostly plant based. During this period I gained 10 pounds in the span of two months along with hormonal pills I needed to take that made me gain weight. For awhile after this I didn’t care about what I ate/how much I ate as long as I had enough energy to study for school. However with my time spent in quarantine I’ve had more time to truly look at myself and examine my body and did not like it. I began trying to eat healthier and workout but bouts of anxiety caused overeating. About a week ago I got some traumatic/anxiety causing news that scared me and I binge ate so much food. I ate all the “tempting” food in my house under the notion that the day after I would not be tempted with any food and will be able to start my weight loss. It worked. Since that day I have been counting my calories and eating as little as I can so that in a few weeks I will be at my goal weight.(the rules for this subreddit say I can’t specify how many calories and I do not want to trigger anyone) The hunger doesn’t bother me at all and I can chug water when I feel hunger, I enjoy it a little bit. The problem is the energy loss and dizziness I began feeling today. I love studying and working but I feel dizzy and yucky. Today I planned on eating the least amount all week because yesterday I was faced with a social cue in which I had to eat with someone else and I did not want them to suspect anything. Today I began feeling dizzy and weak after I was done eating for the day and couldn’t concentrate on my work. I let myself eat a fruit to get nutrients but this means I have to subtract those calories from tomorrow. Eating started to make me feel nauseous yesterday and the last thing I want to do for my body is cause unnecessary discomfort and exert energy vomiting. This has only been going on five days so I do not know if this is a phase or the start of an eating disorder. I just want to be thin and be able to study the things I love so that I can succeed in the future.

At 14 I meet my now husband. He saw my issues and would always encourage me to eat and be healthy. So over time I got better and gained weight. My partner and I have educated ourselves and I felt like I was on the right track to health. I would work out appropriately and I eat appropriately.

My boyfriend eats so much, like huge portions and super unhealthy food yet he’s really slim. When he goes to get food with me in his company, he never offers me anything which further enforces the idea in my head that I really shouldn’t be eating anyway. He’s called other girls fat before, including his ex, which I know is a very big red flag but he’s never been horrible about my size or body.

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to get around this.. I wish we could go on dinner dates like normal couples, and that I didn’t have to starve myself when I see him, and that he picked up more on the fact that I am.

TW: restriction, anorexia nervosa











I would appreciate some advice. I went through a bad time at uni over Christmas time and unfortunately relapsed. I was hardly eating around March time  and the smallest I have been weight wise. When I came back to my parents (due to corona )I started eating a lot more normally and put on weight, it was a lot easier than I thought it would be and I think the change of environment as well as being near my boyfriend really helped. I also had the distraction of revision for university exams so at the time I was thinking I needed to eat to concentrate and revise for these.

After my exams have finished however I’ve panicked at how much I have put on ( over a period of 4 months). I am now the largest I have been in over 2 years. Now it is a lot harder than when I first started trying to recover, almost counterintuitively. I can’t stop obsessing about how I have ‘ let myself go’ and obsessing about the calories in everything. I also get huge hunger pangs even though I am sticking to my food plan and am continuing to put on weight, I think maybe because I have restricted for so long and this is my bodies reaction. I can’t increase my food because I know if my rate of putting on weight increases I will relapse. 

I don’t know what to do. I hate my new body and pray for a day I can’t stop obsessing about how much weight I have put on but it seems to far off at this point.",Request: Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/hom3mq/request_advice/,1594395901,10-07-20 4:45

I also eat more snacks because I don’t have to buy it myself as they usually didn’t make in the budget when I lived alone. Plus, I can’t work out at all. All the gyms are closed and I can’t take a walk anywhere.

Some backstory: I relapsed into anorexia and lost an extreme amount of weight in a short period of time last year, and after a short hospitalization the rate of weight loss slowed but I continued to drop until earlier this year. All of a sudden, I began experiencing extreme panic attacks. The first time I had one, I thought I was going to die. Since then, I’ve begun the process of recovery, and am working towards weight restoration. I want to recover and I’ve just reached the point where my weight is maintaining, so we are increasing my meal plan and hopefully I’ll start gaining soon. I’ve been eating 6x/day for about three weeks now. My anxiety has improved marginally, but not much. I constantly obsess over whether I’m going crazy, and I’m terrified that I’m actually just psychotic. Doctors have told me I’m not psychotic or schizophrenic or bipolar or any of the other things I obsess over (they have, however said I likely have OCD and PTSD) but my anxiety over these things seemingly came on suddenly when my weight was at its lowest. Oddly enough my anxiety isn’t about gaining weight but about the fact that I’m terrified of being crazy. I wake up in the morning feeling panic. I’ve never experienced anxiety this bad as an adult.

I have followed many different meal plans, some prescribed by dietitians, some self-administered (but still modeled after the former ones). They have never, ever worked.

If anything, they have regularly only made things worse. Usually the cycle goes like this:

-I follow this meal plan;

-I instantly become incredibly rigid and obsessive around it, to the point of purging for an hour straight because I slightly exceeded the number of exchanges or the portion size that is ""allowed"";

-since I have seemingly perpetual extreme hunger and no portion size or caloric amount seems to satisfy me, I always end up occasionally binging (and then often purging); 

-when I talk about this with the dietitian, I get told that ""it's all in my head"" and that ""you cannot possibly expect any dietitian to prescribe you one whole box of cereals at breakfast just because it's what you think you like"";

-so I get stuck, desperate and hopeless and inevitably end up ditching the plan altogether because it clearly doesn't work.

I didn't even use to purge before meal plans. I used to restrict heavily for most of the time and then allowing myself to binge with no limits once in a while, so that at least during that binge I could eat what I truly wanted. With meal plans not only I no longer have that (relatively) guilt-free binge, but when I do binge I feel incredibly guilty because I didn't follow my meal plan and because the meal plan is supposed to satisfy me and blah blah blah...and so I purge.

It's very frustrating, because emotionally wise my life is going so much better lately. But my ED just keeps getting worse and worse. I often find myself crying in the evenings because I'm just so hungry, even though I eat an ""adequate"" amount of food every day with ""balanced macronutrients"" and all that jazz and I am no longer ""underweight"" in a clinical sense.

Ive never been diagnosed but ive been suffering from disordered eating/thoughts and as a result I feel like Im on an endless cycle of hysteria. I havent really seen it myself but my mom has noticed that ive been looking more gaunt and has been worried that Ive been restricting/over exercising (which may be true, I feel like my disordered thinking is making things seem false). At this point, i told her how ive been feeling regarding my thinking and that i also feel that my routine of going on 4+ mile walks/strict food rules is unsustainable. 

However, although I thought we both reached an understanding the issues that i was facing (and me resolving to recover) and my mom’s concerns for my wellbeing, etc., she has been recently doing the same thing. She has been concerned with her appearance and has been making comments that have been somewhat triggering (“oh my legs are fat, ive been gaining weight, i cant deal with this”). Although shes been telling me to eat more (which is understandable enough), i noticed that she has been restricting and only eating a piece of fruit, coffee, and then a microwaveable pocket that doesnt sustain for long. My whole family has somewhat noticed this and tells her to eat more, but she would often say that she ate a lot earlier and is full. As we are mostly in the house due to the pandemic, ive been with her for most of the day and know that this isnt true. 

 I guess long story short, i feel frustrated that the same advice my mom has given me and her worries on my health is not practiced by herself and as a result, i feel like i have to compensate by going back to my old routines (which im trying to get out of). I also discussed my problems with my sister (who i feel may also have some disordered thinking regarding eating and exercising) and she too has told me how my habits aren’t sustainable, yet her way of thinking has been also toxic (i.e. we both ate a meal but i later threw up bc it wasnt sitting well with me, and she subtly stated all that happened to her was she gained weight (as if she would rather have thrown it up)).

I've currently waiting 4 and a half years for an eating disorder admission however there is a nationwide (England) shortage of high risk male beds.

My daughter has been getting progressively worse with the amount of food she will eat. She cuts back on portion sizes and downright argues with me just to end the required amount of food to sustain herself. She’ll get small kids sizes and then eat less than she should just to be healthy. I cook healthy meals and she still does this. It’s to the point where she cries after every single meal after having to force her to eat at all. She won’t eat if I don’t force her or threaten some kind of consequence. This has gotten progressively worse for 6 months or so. She’ll break down and cry about how she looks and how she’s heavier than every one else. Beg to do diets like slim fast shakes and keto. We’ve had talks with her doctors who have showed her she’s on the right path to growth and they aren’t medically worried about her weight at all. They’ve explained to her if she can’t seem to feel good about food that she’ll have to see a therapist and then the next step is hospitalization. Her doctor explained how crash diets aren’t healthy for most adults let alone developing kids. She explained how a healthy lifestyle is best. We’ve been in the urgent care because she thought she couldn’t breathe come to find out she’s had panic attacks because of something she ate.

As her mom I support her every way I can. I encourage her to have a positive image. I don’t put her down. I eat and serve healthy meals. Encourage a healthy lifestyle and exercise. This isn’t working. She’s slowly getting worse and I honestly am not sure what to do about it. I always pay attention to her, so her lying about eating or not doesn’t work. I just don’t want this to develop further into something drastically out of control and have her super unhealthy. I want to schedule appointments with nutritionists and therapists that specialize in this kind of stuff, but I am honestly not sure if that will push her further into it.

Any advice anyone could give me to keep her on the right path and not have this develop further would be great. I’m honestly scared and unsure how to approach.

Hi! If you don’t want to read it all, I put the questions at the very end of each paragraph. 

So basically I have been struggling with binge eating for a really long time. While I lived with my parents, they were able to very strictly control it, which I resented, but now I am grateful for. When I left for college, I gained a seriously significant amount of weight in one year. I eat such a healthy diet all day, and then at night I eat EVERYTHING. I feel disgusting the next day, and like it wasn’t even me. I tried to fake ADHD for the adderall (I know it was wrong, I was desperate). The psychiatrist said I actually have Bipolar Disorder and put me on depakote. At my second visit, I came flat out and asked for an appetite suppressant, not expecting much, but she put me on 30mg of Vyvanse. My first question is here: Was 30mg enough for anyone who has experienced this? 

Secondly, I really do only binge at night, and I have terrible insomnia, which depakote doesn’t help. I feel like if I could just go to sleep maybe I wouldn’t eat as much. She told me to take the Vyvanse in the morning, but I’m thinking about taking it around noon so it lasts into the time periods of like 8-midnight, which is when I want to binge, as many people say their medicine wears off around 7pm. The only problem with this is people say Vyvanse causes terrible insomnia. That is my second question, does anyone have experience with the insomnia? Have you tried taking it later in the day and had positive or negative results? 

Third, I have become a very regular smoker of marijuana. It calms me down and really lets me relax, which my brain has terrible trouble with. It also helps me sleep. I know it has the very minimal chances of causing cardiac arrest when mixed with Vyvanse, but that’s not my question here. I am worried it will undo the appetite suppressant feeling that Vyvanse gives me. Any experiences with this? Lastly, I feel that being put on Vyvanse is giving me an even worse eating disorder. I keep thinking of it as my ‘skinny pills’ and feeling so grateful that something will curb my appetite enough that I may be able to go a day or two without eating at all. I have wanted to lose weight so desperately for so long. I am so ashamed of the point I am at. Does anyone have experiences or tips with this? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I appreciate any insight, similar experiences, advice... I just would prefer that if you have something negative, please keep it to yourself.

I don't know if I even technically have an eating disorder, let me start off with that - but it seems like no matter what I do, I end up obsessing over calories and eating as little as I physically can without literally collapsing to the floor OR paying no attention the impact food has on my body and eating a ridiculous amount. I definitely trend towards eating too much, but there have been months long periods where I start out thinking I'll constrict my Calories to xxx a day (a reasonable number) and then end up in this manic state every time I think of food and eat less than yyy Calories (very low) in a day for weeks or months. Most days ending up with around zzz (a extremely low number). When I'm NOT in this state where I obsess over calories, I eat my emotions, I eat solely for pleasure, I'll eat until I feel ill, I'll eat out of boredom, I'll eat and eat and eat for forever. Even if I don't eat for a long period of time I end up eating ridiculous portions at every meal. I just don't know how to lose weight without triggering that other side of me.

I started starving myself at the end of my freshman year of high school. I started slowly skipping meals and exercising this went on during summer break but got progressively worse during the break I got my first period but I kept starving myself and exercising I didn't get mine for 5 months after my very first one due to the very few amounts of food I consumed. I would go to the doctor they would ask what I was doing to lose so much weight but I would lie and say I was eating healthy and exercising. My parents suspected that I wasn't eating right but I would lie until they believed my lies. This kept going on for about a year I would be afraid to eat afraid of gaining weight or if I ever ate something that was considered unhealthy I would regret it so much I would take laxatives and weight loss pills. The only thing I would eat was a sandwich a day. Strands of my hair would fall out and I had very low energy two times I was close to fainting. I had these periods of time we're I Would just binge eat tons of food till I was stuffed and immediately regret and starve the next day. That's how it went for the whole year I had ups and downs but then I became determined to get my period back so I ate a bit more than I usually did and I got it back immediately after that bit I still kept eat low amounts of food. 

Up until now, I've managed to keep my period and I'm eating a bit more than I use to but every time I eat something there's regret that comes after it. Everyone kept praising the way I lost so much weight without knowing the truth behind it. Even my parents would say ”look how good you look now” and in my mind, I would think why people didn't like the way I looked back then. My mom would point out if I seemed to gain weight if she saw that would make me want to eat less. I thought losing all the weight would make me happy but the reality is that it made me more self-conscious about my body and appearance. 

I'm trying to eat better but it's so hard. If I tell my parents they wouldn't understand they would just force me to eat. I've been keeping this in for so long I needed to release it.

Me (27F) and my BF (24M) have been together nearly a year and I have seen him eat (a decent meal) maybe ten times during that time (we don't live together but still). He's significantly underweight at 6'2 and xx lbs. He simply does not like eating. He finds it stressful and a pain and he'll avoid it for as long as possible. He'll buy food to go and it goes uneaten. If we're in a restaurant, he'll order a meal but maybe eat a handful of fries and that's it. He makes the effort to try to eat but doesn't follow through with it. As far as I know, he's been this way since he was a kid. There are several foods he gets excited about but they're snacks of little to no nutritional value and not filling at all, like popcorn. I've mentioned to him before that the only reason he likes popcorn so much is that it's like eating air and he agreed with me. The only body image issues he has is due to how skinny he is. He wishes he could eat more and gain weight but he can't. I've always assured him that I love him, find him attractive and wouldn't want him to change but I'm genuinely fearing for his health at this point.

I (18F) have never said that I have an ED because I've never been diagnosed, but I've also never sought out any professional help or a diagnosis. I'm constantly torn because recently it's been brought to my awareness that I have disordered habits but I don't think I'm anywhere near severe enough to say I have an actual ED. 

To start I should note that I grew up very skinny, I was always tiny and always got the ""oh my god you're so skinny"" remarks, obviously, this made me feel good. But in 7th grade I went from being a very low weight to gaining a bunch. I still was pretty tiny but going from being a skinny little kid to suddenly having hips and a stomach really damaged my self-esteem. 

Looking back I know that I was just growing up and my body wasn't a kid's body anymore. But back then I hated myself. I spent years telling myself not to eat and trying and failing to restrict then hating myself for not being able to do it. I was an angsty middle-schooler and was exposed to the whole Tumblr world of romanticizing mental illness and EDs. Living in an abusive home engaging in this romanticization made me feel better about my terrible mental health and I was infatuated with mental illness and EDs. I won't lie at 13 I WANTED to have an ED or mental illness because I guess I thought if I could be diagnosed with something than people would start caring about me. 

I was in a dark place but it's been years since then and I moved away from home and it's been a long time since I felt like I was in a rough place. I've been happy. Until the beginning of 2020 when I made a decision that I thought would help make me happier, I was tired of being uncomfortable with my body and wanted to lose weight. I didn't think it'd be an issue because I had never actually HAD an eating disorder I just idealized restricting. At first it wasn't an issue but after about five months into my ""weight loss journey"" I was suddenly faced with my issues when someone pointed out my unhealthy and obsessive habits. I was in a healthy weight range but I still wanted to lose more, I didn't think it was a problem. But nothing was enough, I was restricting my calories far too much and obsessively. Food and calories were seriously all I thought about and I spent all of my free time watching weight loss videos. I thought that it was normal to lift up my shirt and check how small my waist looked literally every time I passed a mirror. 

I'm just over what's considered underweight for my height so I'm technically a healthy weight and while my calorie counting is a bit obsessive I still make allowances for myself, I eat cookies sometimes and even though I'm scared of carbs I still eat them in small portions. I don't think I'm very sick but I also don't think that I can stop trying to lose weight. I'm still healthy now but I'm afraid that I'll reach my goal weight and it still won't be enough.

Long story short, my EDs (or odd eating habits as I call them) have been on and off for almost a decade now. It's always been periodical. I can be fine for months and then relapse, which means I restrict, binge and purge on a daily basis. I've been pretty good at hiding them because I've lived on my own most of the times. 

But in 2 weeks, I'm moving to another city, with a very close friend. She has absolutely no idea how fucked up my eating habits are, nor that I have really bad issues with food. I'm almost positive she suspects, as I've recently lost a lot of weight in a very short time, but she's never confronted me on it.

I don't know how to deal with the whole situation. I'm super excited about moving in with her because we're going to have a great time together but at the same time, I'm super anxious about the whole thing. When we decided to move in together a couple of months ago, I really thought that by then, the cycle would have broken up and I'd be fine. Turns out I'm not and it's not getting better. 

I don't mind her knowing that I have EDs but I don't want to tell her about it myself. Because I'm afraid this will only encourage my binging/purging. Like, if she knows, it will be ok if I do it at our home. While if she doesn't, it will give me some limits to what I can and can't do. I don't even know if that makes sense. I'm planning to get medical help as soon as I'm all settled but meanwhile, I have no idea what to do. Not that we're planning on having our meals together (it's a flat share, not a partnership).

We had decided on a restaurant already and it was this Mediterranean/pizza place and i was looking forward to going there as i don't really give myself permission to eat that kind of stuff a lot but then everyone decided that we would go somewhere else as they wanted something more special. It was kind of a last minute decision so some restaurants wouldn't take a reservation and they ended up choosing a Nepalese restaurant where you can't get any food like that. I would usually be happy with this choice but i was annoyed and told my mom in the car that I wouldn't eat anything there and broke down crying. She offered to take me to get food from the other place the next day if I ate at the Nepalese restaurant then but I refused as I knew wouldn't allow myself to eat that kind of a thing the next day. We went to the restaurant and I ended up eating some naan bread but not ordering anything. I kind of regretted it.

My (20F) parents are very critical towards me, always have been, and considerable more than my three younger siblings. This I understand as I am the firstborn child and older sister, I get this to an extent.

My issue arises when they constantly feel the need to comment on my food. In middle and high school, I went through periods where I was bulimic and extremely restrictive with my food. I struggled a lot with body image and weight. I have always been relatively thin, but my weight would regularly fluctuate 10-15 lb because of this. I would either be underweight or healthy weight. Only after I graduated high school and lived mostly independent at college did I finally find food freedom and balance in this area of my life.

I have been home for the first time since going to college long-term because of covid. The comments my parents make about my food and eating habits drives me insane. I eat  a normal amount, maybe even less than normal. I eat pretty healthy because that’s my preference, but I am not crazy about it and also enjoy all types of foods (I am not picky at all). I don’t think I eat any differently than other people I know. Also, everyone in my family usually eats at their own time, including all my siblings. We do not usually eat as a family.

Some examples of what my parents say include:

“You’re always eating”

“You just sit and eat when you want to like a weirdo”

“Why are you always in the kitchen”

“You make all these weird little foods and eat them by yourself like an antisocial person”

Within a month I found myself regressing back to habits and thoughts I had when I was younger. My self image has deteriorated when I had been making so much progress. They have recently been comparing me to my aunt (who they hate), because she is also vegetarian and liberal. They put me down when I am eating and constantly compare me to my aunt because we share those two similarities. My aunt is twice divorced and they sometimes even say that I will “end up like her”. This conversation always stems from them commenting on me eating. I have no idea why they do this. I have tried to ask my parents what they mean when they make these statements but they always just fall back on calling me “weird”. I have spoken to my mom about my past with poor body image. I want it to stop because it has come to the point where I don’t want to be seen by others if I am full or bloated. It makes me feel absolutely disguising.

I lost a huge chunk of weight in my first weight loss journey. I was overweight, and went to very slightly underweight. Around the same time I had a bad car wreck that took me about a year to recover from. I'm still not quite right from it (bad shoulder, bad back) but I still try to do yoga.

During that time, I restricted everything I ate (my goal was a cup of rice made with chicken broth, and half a cup of broccoli, a day), exercised constantly, and punished myself for missing an exercise or breaking my ""diet"" by not eating the next day, and by doing way more exercise than what was probablt healthy.

By the end of it I was teeny tiny and loving it. Lightly toned, I could see my hip bones, and my stomach was *flat* - two things I've literally never seen on me, in my life. Everyone said I looked great, and I felt great. I may have passed out once and a while because I didn't eat, but I didn't mind so much... except when I had my meltdowns at the end of the day where I'd want to kill myself for eating a donut.  Anyway...

I met my boyfriend at that time (and at that weight) and he's a chef, LOVES to cook (and cooks REALLY good food...) and I verryyyy slowly stopped caring about calories or restricting, because it made him so happy when I ate and enjoyed his cooking. 

I'm up quite a bit in weight than what I was when we met, and even now I can feel my ED kicking in again where I don't want to eat, ever, and Im starting to mentally punish myself for not working out daily. Makes me sick to my stomach to want to eat, especially because we're on a tight budget, and his type is quite petite... tiny...

Now, I'm dealing with health issues related to passing out regularly, even when I DO eat. Went to the ER for one episode and got diagnosed with Syncope, but it's so general there's nothing more that diagnosis gave me..

642,EDPostRequests,1595533391,hwmjml,"8 years ago I decided to lose some major weight. I managed to get just outside of my ideal weight but I did it in an unhealthy way, in that I developed a combination of eating disorders. I’d purge whenever I felt immediately after a meal I’d eaten too much. I was highly restrictive on what I are, by obsessively counting calories, and wouldn’t eat if I felt that I had done poorly the day before or would purge if I thought I ate too much. As I over came that, I started to just exercise everything off as I got fitter. I would do whatever it took to burn off the energy I’d just consumed, no matter how ridiculous the challenge was. Once I got down to my ideal weight I became more healthy. I are right and exercised like a normal person. I felt good about me. I still had issues with food and my body, but I fought threw them. Though my teeth and esophagus still had evidence of me hurting me, to the world I looked happy and fit. 

Fast forward to today, I decided years ago to just let go. I stoped exercising, stopped counting, stopped the healthy lifestyle I accidentally fell into after battling with different EDs. I’m now heavier than I ever was and highly unhappy with myself and my body. I want to be fit again, but I want to be healthy. I don’t want to get into hurting my body again to get something fast. The thing is yesterday I purged. It’s the first time in years but I didn’t hesitate. I’m afraid I’ll fall back into an ED while I try to get my eating and exercise back to healthy amounts, it’s why I’ve been so hesitant in the past.

I was suffering from OCD (health, pedophilia, harm, orientation), GAD, anxiety, intrusive thoughts. Let's be honest, it is not effortless to look for help. Embarrassment, or just feeling that it will be an emotional investment which will surely fail. At least this was my case, but I know that many people have their own reasons not to do it.

This is why now - as a psychology student, I decided to take action on this issue. I am running a study that is going to assess if the free mobile application using mindfulness training (very simple in usage) is effective in decreasing symptoms of OCD and others. It is not a long study. All it needs is to fulfill a couple of questionnaires, use the app due to the guide for 14 days just 10 minutes a day. But I cannot succeed without your help.

The rule is easy - the bigger sample, the more reliable results. The application may be helpful for you, may bring you some new way of self-help, or be just a new experience and attempt. Without your help, I will not be able to succeed in my study, and what I want to do is to share the results of it, so we will make another small step in increasing the accessibility of self-help methods.

Of course - I would love to discuss the study, hear your opinions because there is no science without critics. Thank you!

In the end - if I succeed, I want to share my study results here as a ""thank you"" for a community for making this possible.

WHY DO I THINK IT IS FAIR DEAL?

First of all, this application and training helped me, so sharing it with you guys is a way of me showing some of you the new ways you can help yourself as I did. If my study succeeds, we make another step and have a scientific basis to recommend it to others.
We have a deal here - if you help me by giving me records of your experience, I give you the results back.

A few years ago I developed anorexia. I never sought treatment at the time. I have since been seeing a therapist who said clinically I would have fit the diagnostic criteria at the time. She has helped me immensely. Anyway, as the illness progressed I started getting sick a lot so they did blood work, and found my WBCs and a few other numbers were quite low. So low in fact, that I was referred to a hematologist on suspicion of some kind of cancer. The doc was kind but never suspected an eating disorder. No where in the whole ordeal did anyone screen me for an eating disorder, despite some obvious signs. I think I was so scared at that point that I started trying to recover on my own. I still don’t feel fully there, but my bloodwork numbers came up after about a year.

However, since then, I still get sick a lot. It takes me longer to recover from a cold or something minor than most of my friends. I feel like I did irreparable damage to my immune system.

I've recently, say over the past six months or so, begun experiencing a strange sharp pain around my esophagus area. It doesn't happen very frequently, comes and go seemingly at random, and only last very briefly, a minute at the very most. Even so its highly uncomfortable and worries me, I'm super scared that I may have damaged or even torn my esophagus. 

For background, I've struggled with purging and other ED behaviors for several years. For about two years I was able to avoid relapsing while attending therapy but around a year and a half ago I relapsed and have unfortunately fallen into those bad habits again. Nowadays when I do relapse its much fewer and further between, and also not aggressively forceful compared to when I first began suffering from my Ed, but of course any amount of relapsing is not good for my body or mental health and i don't want to minimize that.

For years now I have gone through (usually) short phases of where I’ll make myself throw up after eating. It’s been more consistent the last 7/8 months though. Within these last few months I still go through “phases” I guess where I’ll do it consistently after every meal for about a week or two and then won’t do it again for another week or two. I usually make myself throw up after eating something unhealthy (tend to binge on junk food quite a lot) or eating a really big meal. But if I’ve been eating healthy meals then I won’t do it because I do still want to keep the healthy nutrients in my body. So lately it’s been more a few days on, a few days off - rather than weeks.

In the past when I’ve eaten to the point of discomfort (like when a dish is really good and I don’t want to stop eating it) I’d sometimes purge afterward to alleviate the stomach ache/nausea that I experience.

Lots of gas, burps, anxiety, bubble guts, acid reflux, constipation the list goes on but those are my main symptoms that are bothersome especially the burping. I burp all day even when I wake up. (I assume I swallow air because I’m anxious) just a guess. Many test later, I’m basically fine from a docs perspective. I got diagnosed with “too much acid” at the ER and also “sibo” from a gastro doc but no Test were done to determine sibo yet due to Covid however I’ve done every other test possible with everything looking great so my list of things that “could be wrong with me” is down to those 2 but overall I’m “healthy” 
However, I thought I’d come on this thread and ask people if they can relate with me because I typically restrict my food intake, not on purpose but because I always feel sick. I am underweight due to this mess. Typically if I don’t eat or I accidentally skip meals, the acid comes up and then I feel too sick to actually eat so I have to wait hours until it calms down and then I end up only eating very little. On a good day I’ll eat a balanced diet which is an accomplishment for me and I feel better when there is food in my stomach. Bloated but a bit better. 
I guess my question is does restriction really screw up your stomach and maybe that’s why I’m bloated because my digestion is slow from restricting? And maybe that’s why I get reflux and burping because my stomach is just simply full of acid and no food? I don’t want to do this anymore. Honestly I don’t even want to be thin. I want to be healthy again. I was not restricting because I want to be thin, I did it because when I’m stressed or anxious, I feel sick. Then the sickness leads to acid reflux and burping and feeling like I’m gonna puke so then I don’t eat because I don’t want to puke BUT it’s a domino effect because I feel like me not eating regularly is making things worse. 
Typically I’ll have few good days of eating a balanced diet and then I’ll go down hill and accidentally miss a meal or get anxious and it messes up everything and then I’ll have a few bad days of eating less until I work my way back up to eating normally again. 
Also, side note: I get so anxious that I tend to gag and choke when eating or drinking. Mostly drinking. I Honestly think it’s all in my head and again it just makes me think maybe my stress levels are causing my gut issues plus not eating. It’s like my body doesn’t know how to work normally anymore or digest properly because I’m always on edge and constantly thinking about it. 
Is basically my best bet is to just try to force myself to eat, suffer the bloating, gas and burping and try to live a stress free life and it’ll just soon fade away? 
Another reason I’m asking question on this feed is because in the passed when I would have anxiety, I would see a therapist and they would just say I have an eating disorder. It was horrible because I didn’t. They would treat me like I was manipulating everything I was saying during our sessions but I wasn’t at all!

656,EDPostRequests,1595323627,hv4civ,"Hi all- just needing a place to share right now. All throughout my life I was super underweight, to the point that doctors were trying everything to force me to gain weight. This resulted in my parents never putting emphasis on teaching me about healthy eating or anything of the sort. Their logic was “whatever will make her gain weight”. Well-fast forward a number of years and I am now a weight that many would consider normal/bordering on overweight. I SEE myself as $@&amp;#ing gigantic, though. 

Whenever I’m home by myself I will often order myself lunch and order 2-3 meals. Sometimes I’ll eat it all throughout the day, other times I’ll pick some of each thing and throw the rest away. This will only ever happen when I’m by myself. My spouse does not witness this behavior and I’m actually very self conscious about how much I eat in front of people. This is all just to provide some backstory though..

See- whenever I eat I have severe urges to vomit. I’ve only ever intentionally purged maybe twice. I’m scared of all the side effects of purging and am just certain that when I throw up I’m going to die because of it at some point. The issue, however, is that I also have a very nervous stomach and struggle with some medical problems that make me throw up a lot. At any point after eating if I wanted to I could instantly throw up my food. If I’m feeling particularly sad or stressed or anxious I’ll throw up. I’ve never gotten medical help though, beyond a brief screener, because I keep losing weight as a result of throwing up, even when it’s out of my control. Where as other people would feel concerned if they were some pounds lighter after not changing anything about their diet, I was ecstatic. 

I know how unhealthy this is. Part of me knows the answer and what I need to do. But I feel like I’m living in a state of denial. I keep thinking “if it ever actually gets bad I’ll know and get help”. 

I can’t tell my spouse because she is overweight, and I feel like shit whenever I bring up my weight insecurities because they are much larger than I am, so I feel like I’m being a bitch whenever I shame my thinner body.

This last year has been hard because of a rollercoast of issues and emotions, so much so that I started binge eating and puking almost daily.  I also have these extreme urges of pickiness that I get and can’t force myself to get over.  Like, I can’t eat anything else until I get what I’m craving, even if it’s been 4-5 days.

I wanted a plain Cheeseburger happy meal yesterday and I still want one and tried to ask for one for dinner, but I have anxiety and couldn’t outright ask, even over text.  We never eat out because we are dirt poor and this is the first time we had an extra $15 for food in a while.

My husband and kids ended up going for Burger King and he brought me back a meal too.  I was automatically stressed because when I crave something I literally can’t eat anything other than that exact thing 95% of the time.  I took 15 minutes talking myself down from a panic attack and decided I would eat this since it was close to what I wanted.  I go to open it and am hit with the smell of mustard.  It’s not plain, it’s regular.  I go through everything in my head I can possibly do to salvage the food and realize anything is going to make me cry at this point.  So I let my oldest eat my burger since he wanted a second anyways, pretend to eat a couple onion rings and then immediately go throw up.  I still ended up crying for 30 minutes in bed while they hung out.  I tried my hardest to tell my husband I was sad and really wanted this specific item PLAIN and I couldn’t do it.  He doesn’t understand mental illness or ED...

How on Earth am I supposed to eat food I hate?  I’m not only extremely picky (I eat super plain foods like a toddler) and have had major past issues with ED, but I get these insane cravings when my estrogen is high that make the picky eating a recipe for guaranteed tantrums and relapse.  How can I force myself to eat food I don’t like or food that’s made wrong?  Taking the item back is not an option since my husband will take out the stress of having something remade on me and getting what I want is almost never an option because I get voted out.

To juxtapose this, I’ve been trying to eat healthy non-processed foods this week and eat 3 meals a day so i can have sustainable weight loss, but stay under a calorie intake which I’ve been pretty successful at so far but I can’t seem to lose any weight. I’m eating a lot of raw veggies, fish, low sodium foods and I don’t eat meat. I’m also drinking things like collagen, MCT oil, alkaline water, lemon water, all this shit. I’ve also started working out again and walking a lot more again. But because I’m not seeing results fast, I feel so tempted to starve myself. But i know that causes me to binge eat which is why I’m overweight right now. The other night I didn’t feel good after dinner so it made me sick (i wasn’t trying to purge i just really felt nauseous), but I ate very few calories that day so I lost 4 pounds overnight.  That made me feel like I’ll only see results if I starve myself. 

I just don’t understand why I’m not dropping weight when I’m tracking the evidence that I’m eating less &amp; healthier. Does it take a long time? I have never made an attempt to lose weight in a proper way, and when i was my “goal weight”, i was only able to attain it in accompaniment with a spiraling drug addiction. 

All of the ruminating thoughts, and obsessiveness makes me question if I’m actually being healthy right now or if I’m just trying out a whole new set of unhealthy eating behaviors?

I have gone from xx pounds  down to yy within 2 months, cutting my calories low anywhere from x-y (extremely low) a  day with consistent cardio and a lifting regiment. I weigh myself often  and every time I reach a new weight goal, I set a new one. I am finally  nearly at a healthy BMI (but not quite there), but I look at myself and  still think I look just as fat, despite this very obviously not being  the case. However, I have always had this body dismorphia issue, at one  point in my life I lost weight naturally not even thinking about my  eating, it just happened. At about 6 foot and xx pounds (thin, but in normal range, much lower than yy), I never  realized that I wasn’t fat until my doctor told me, and even then still  felt fat. I also do not mind if the scale moves up, and even took a full  week to eat normally to see what I weighed at outside of water weight,  so I would like to say I am comfortable with gain and do not see it as  an issue. I have never been self conscious about my body, nor have I  cried about being fat, just seeking physical improvement for sports, and  to feel good on a regular basis, and I already feel much better  physically. My main concern is that I’ve heard people at this caloric  intake often don’t realize they have an issue, and when they are through  with losing weight find themselves checking the scale constantly,  monitoring their eating, etc. Does it sound to this sub that I have a  problem that I need to kick, or does it sound like I have an issue. Only  asking because if I am falling into anorexia, I need to stop  immediately. I would not want to live with a disorder as harsh as that.

I started my weight loss journey last November. i became overweight, which is why i started to work out and eat better. I lost a significant amount of weight, in 8 months. I am proud of what i accomplished for myself, but i can’t help to now become obsessed over losing weight more and more and my calorie intake a day. I don’t give my self permission to eat unless i have worked out that day. I think over xxx calories (low number) a day is very bad. Everytime i eat anything, i obsess over the amount of fat in it, calories, sugar, etc. if it’s slighter bigger in calories i will be down about it the whole day. Although i kind of know that this is not healthy at all, it feels like it’s out of my control and that i can’t stop it. :( I’m not sure what to do. this feeling feels so permanent.","Request: Lost weight to become healthy, but am now obsessed with it",https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/htyqsi/request_lost_weight_to_become_healthy_but_am_now/,1595178206,19-07-20 6:03
662,EDPostRequests,1595156455,htypux," I wanna start off by saying. I love him so much. Regardless of his weight, I could pretty much care less about what he looks like. Whats important to me is that he’s happy and healthy. 

That being said my husband has always strived to be very health conscious. Before we started dating he was healthy weight, looking and eating. But as for everyone, once you get in a relationship eating habits can start to falter in the health spectrum, and we eat more. Thats understandable to a point. I’ve even gained a bit of weight since we first started dating, but I realized this. Put goals in place and lost it all and some. He’s gained about xx-lb. He’s always expressed a deep interest in maintaining health and wellness through diet and physical activity. (I know he isnt just saying this because of me and my loss, because he’s the one who first encouraged ME to work out more, and lose weight..) But lately I found he basically has two versions of himself. The version who cares deeply about it, and the person who has 3 bowls of ice cream a day, a bag of chips a day, and 4 meals per day. May be a bit of an exaggeration but— not too far off at all. 

I try to sometimes politely remind him about his goals, and that whether he realizes it or not he’s hurting himself in the long run. If he’s in a binge eating mood he simply tells me he does NOT care at all and continues. And of course later regrets it and feels bad for himself. I am very worried because I believe he’s falling into dangerous territory of having an actual binge eating disorder thats been slowly building into itself for a few years now. I try to encourage him to visit a dietician and even cook healthy meals, and try to diet with him actively to make him feel less alone and maybe stick to a healthier lifestyle better but he consistently falls into a hole where he doesnt care. Maybe I’m overthinking it, if that’s the case let me know but I feel like I have genuine concern because I hate to see my partner feel so badly about how he looks, and I want him to be happy and confident. I also deeply fear that this could intensify into something much much worse IE Bulimia.

667,EDPostRequests,1595156115,htynv1,"I think I developed an ED over the last few months, or at least my parents insist I have and I am tempted to agree - I have started overexercising and calorie restricting, and have a series of 'goal weights' that I feel a desperate need to meet, no matter the costs. This started after I moved away from home and became very isolated; I am now at home with my parents, who I truly believe only want the best for me.

After almost collapsing a few days ago, I agreed with my parents that I had a problem, and that we would start working on it. They seemed thrilled with how easy it was to get me to agree to a higher 'maximum calories' on my counting apps. The issue is that I am still restricting, but am pretending I'm not. If asked, I tell them that I'm eating the newly agreed total. I eat 'a lot' in front of them, but lie about calorie totals and what I eat when they aren't there. I also feel a compulsion to exercise, especially if I have eaten in front of them multiple times in a day and have eaten over my old 'maximum'.

My parents love me, and I love them. I know for sure that if I spoke to them about it, they would try and help. I also know it would break their hearts and that they would blame themselves, even though this isn't their fault. My father has already struggled greatly with the idea I ever had an ED, and he thinks they have cured me and sorted it. I can't take that certainty away from him, or my mother. Likewise, I know that if I keep losing weight they will notice, so they will find out anyway - that just seems like a bridge I can cross when I come to it. 

I don't know how to break it to them now without seeming like a liar or making them feel like failures. I know I need to communicate with them that just changing something on my app and watching me eat ice-cream isn't a solution, but likewise I don't want this to be their problem.

My therapist and nutritionist have been talking me through my habits and logically I know this isn’t fake, but whenever I eat more than one meal a day or meet the calorie goal my nutritionist has set for me, I feel like maybe I could’ve been doing this all along and I just gave myself an eating disorder for attention.

3. She once in her young adulthood ate so little that she was able to &gt;!see all her ribs!&lt; and her &gt;!knees were thicker than her thighs!&lt; and suffered some related health symptoms. She has recently described this as ""goal.""

4. She has been told by her mother her whole life that people would like her better if she were thinner, and she agrees.

5. Shortly after quarantine began she began to feel urges to reduce the amount of food she consumes. She began to skip meals.

6. Her eating habits concern her close friends who know about it .

7. Her mom has been very supportive of her weight loss, even when she told her she hasn't been eating much. Recently she told her she was proud of her for not eating.

8. After that, in the past month she began tracking calories.

9. No matter what her calorie goal is, she feels stressed unless she is a couple hundred calories below. She also overestimates her calories.

10. She weighs herself 5+ times a day.

11. She thinks that she looks extremely fat, and I think she looks normal and of average weight. 

12. I convinced her to tell her therapist about her eating habits of late.

15. He told her that the amount she eats is healthy and he would only be concerned if she regularly ate &gt;!500 - 600!&lt; calories a day. He wasn't concerned that she's lost &gt;!8 lbs!&lt; in a month.

16. Because of her experience in therapy, she feel like it's ok to continue on this path. I don't like it and I think this is a bad thing. She says she was worried for nothing and is sorry she tricked me into thinking she had an ED.

682,EDPostRequests,1596063056,i0akwy,"I have not been able to explore this subreddit very much. I see a few folks making posts discovering their own eating disorder. I strongly suspect I have one, but it manifests itself in a way that really feels different from many of the stories I see here.

I feel very self conscious about this, but my disordered eating does not appear to be connected to body weight or body image in any way. I have skipped meals to a point where I was not getting the proper amount of nutrients. There are particular circumstances when my eating is most definitely out of order. It often requires outside help to get me out of my bad habits. Beginning of this month I had fairly easy access to food and some cooking supplies and I still opted to just skip meals. I've learned how much it helps to reach out to others when I'm behaving in ways that concern me, so I've already stabilized from that, but it was still pretty scary.

The thought loops that seem like the unhealthy ones seem more connected to things like ""I have more important things to do than eat right now"" or ""I don't need to prioritize eating today"" or ""I'd rather wait to eat than have folks judge my eating habits"" and other things like that.

It has been difficult to find resources. Sometimes when I reach out to folks, I have encountered resistance and hostility since what I experience doesn't involve struggling with body weight. Sometimes it kind of feels like I'm being pressured to develop obsessions with body weight and body image in order to get resources for the things I do struggle with.

I suppose it could be bad eating habits, but it feels like something that returns when unchecked rather than skills or habits I need to develop. I think I recently experienced the second time in my life when I nearly starved myself and I want to have more tools to avoid that from happening again.

If it's not an eating disorder I don't know what to call it. Since things have stabilized recently it's harder to be as confident it's a real thing. Hoping for warm words and guidance even if folks don't think it is an ed. Would be bummed by more hostility.

686,EDPostRequests,1596016289,hzxxnc,"I’ve been recovering from a mild binge-restrict cycle for a few months now. I call it mild because it wasn’t to the point where I would fast or throw up, but I did overexercise or under-eat meals to compensate for overeating. 

Right now, I’d say I’ve pretty much fixed my eating habits. I have a consistent eating schedule, I plan my meals, I adjust my calorie splits to keep me satisfied through the day, I make sure I’m eating healthy food at least 80% of the time, and I watch my protein intake. I also still work out regularly but this time with an actual goal to be stronger and not just to burn off excess calories. The best part? I feel great! I don’t starve any more mid-day or feel bloated every after dinner.

It seems as if I should be fully recovered from my eating disorder (I‘m not sure if I should call it that because I haven’t been diagnosed), but I still occasionally feel as if I’m being restricted and I get really bad cravings which often leads to overeating or binge eating.

i don’t know why i’m like this. well maybe i do, but i still need to vent a little. i’ve been worried about my weight since i can remember (instilled into me by my older sister). i feel like i’ve always been chubbier than my friends, and i just keep getting more aware of it. i started counting calories in high school, and i weight myself often. after i use the bathroom, in the morning, at night. even a 1lb increase ruins my day. my family doesn’t help, but that’s too much to elaborate on. i just think i’m literally the fattest person ever. i started gaining weight since covid and it’s only made things worse. i like feeling hungry because it feels like i’m burning away fat. i make eating the opposite of priority in my day. if i haven’t eaten all day it’s a success. then of course i get high and eat like shit, so i just keep getting fatter. i used to be significantly lighter, and it kills me that i’m not there anymore. it makes it all seem hopeless, if i do lose weight it will no doubt come back. according to the internet i have the bmi for an overweight person, so that just ruins my life more. 

i’m so hyper aware of my appearance i legitimately can’t focus on anything else. when i’m out with friends, alone, passing a reflective surface, taking pictures. all of it is a nightmare because i’m humiliated that people have to see me. that fact that others can see me so fat is so embarrassing. and they all lie to me and tell me i’m not fat. i just wish i didn’t have a body. i don’t know if it’s an eating disorder or just intense self loathing, but more more i anticipate how i can leave this body as quickly as possible, if you catch my drift. sometimes i get so angry looking at myself, like “seriously, you have to be fat right now, and you can even fix it?” 

i get so mad i hit myself, or other things. if i could carve it all off my body i would. i worry sometimes though because i look at a model, or something considered skinny or in shape, and i think “they aren’t even that skinny” like even super models aren’t skinny enough for me. i just feel like my life would get so much better if i was skinny. people would i like me more, i’d look less awkward. people in gyms and exercise classes wouldn’t treat me like i’m an idiot. i don’t know where this is going. sorry for the long post. also please don’t take this as pro-the way i’m living. i’m miserable like this.

So I do not have an eating disorder, but I am fully aware of some bad habits that i cannot seem to stop doing.. and I'm wondering if anyone else does this or if there is a name for it? I also have BPD which I'm sure plays a role in this, but I'm just not sure how to control it.
 
To start, when I was in my late teens I was very unhealthy with my eating habits. I starved, only ate chicken broth and black coffee, and lived on laxatives. I was never underweight, but I did lose a lot of weight. I stopped doing this probably 4 years ago.. but have always focused on my weight. I hardly son almost 2 years ago, gained a ton of weight with the pregnancy and went hard core on weight loss again. 

Currently, I seem to cycle between extreme dieting, losing about 10-15 lbs, and then binging. Hard. To the point that I feel shitty about myself and my body physically hurts. Then, I take some laxatives ( not like I used to), and go back to dieting. And by dieting i dont mean starving, just, crazy dieting? Very particular about everything that i eat. Idk. 

Mostly my concern is that I cannot control the binges. Like, I'll know in my head that I need to stop but I just cant.

I’m looking for advice on how to approach my little sister with the following. 

“My (24F) little sister (16F) is in training to be a professional ballerina. She is naturally on the skinnier side, but in ballet it is desired to be absolutely tiny. Our mother was a dancer, and although she won’t admit it, has some issues with food still, many years after ending her ballet career (complain about weight gain, won’t eat breakfast or lunch some days etc.). 
I should also mention that due to infidelity that I discovered as a teen between my parents, my relationship with my sister is strained (I found out, confronted that parent, but ended up not telling my sibling as to not ruin their relationship with that parent. I was then severely punished for every little misstep as a teen by that parent, and was blamed for all the fighting that my sister overheard but did not know the cause behind). 

Anyways. She was gone this weekend visiting a friend. She never does her laundry, and trying to be nice I went to separate her laundry to do it for her. She was recently diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and having been diagnosed myself, know that sometimes even something as small as laundry can make everything seem worse. While going through, I found a bunch of clothes everywhere. Not just in the hamper but under the bed, in suitcases from weeks ago, etc. So I went through her room to get all the clothes. While going through, I discovered a ton of candy wrappers hidden in a storage ottoman. Like, probably 100 full sized wrappers. 

When she came home I was still doing her laundry so some was on piles on the floor, some folded on her bed, so she knows that I did her laundry. But I think she knows that I know about the wrappers as she was in a very weird mood at supper. 

My question, is how/do I address this with her. I’ve mentioned binge eating to my parents before and they sort of just brush it off or get mad at her which will then drive it to be more hidden. I feel like if she didn’t have such pressure both at home and at dance she maybe wouldn’t have such a problem. She’s always had a problem controlling her sweet tooth, even as a little kid, but the sheer amount of wrappers felt out of control to me. This isn’t eating a few too many cookies when baking. It’s not being able to stop, and hoarding the evidence. 

Maybe I shouldn’t have gone through her room, (she’s always very open with her room, will ask me to go in to look for things when she’s gone, etc.) but I did and I can’t take that bad or undo that. So what do I do about the wrappers? 
(And no, I don’t know who her therapist is, so I can’t send an email to her therapist letting her know what I discovered without asking my sister who she is).

For the longest time I was bulimic and it went pretty hand in hand w my alcoholism, it became daily and euphoric to purge, I was obsessed with eating too. I loved food, the thought of food made me happy, eating made me dance, I ate whatever the hell I wanted and dealt with the consequences later but I still ate. I had an appetite. 

Earlier in January I quit drinking and smoking cigarettes and was trying to turn my life around, and as part of that, I also worked on my recovery with eating. I was still eating a lot, I started gaining weight, but I stopped purging. 

I don't know what happened to me recently and I'm not sure if this is due to medication I'm taking for my migraines and insomnia, but I became someone I didn't recognize. I've always struggled with different eating disorders but the common thread was that I was always hungry, I was always obsessing over food. I now have no appetite. Like none whatsoever, I usually go more than 24 hrs before I put something in my mouth and even then I can't get half way through the plate. This happened for over a month and then I realized I have been obsessing over my weight again, and I have been dropping weight faster than I ever have. People around me are suggesting that I'm falling back in to disordered habits again, some even saying anorexia? 

I went out yesterday with a friend because I haven't seen him since the quarantine and I felt so disgusted with myself not being able to order anything, eventually I ordered juice. I couldn't even get half way through it and then for the first time since January, I went to the the bathroom and purged out fucking juice.

I don't know if this means I'm bulimic again or if I'm anorexic because I never eat, I don't know what the hell I'm doing, this is the first time in months that I've been honest with myself about any of this because to everyone around me I've been calling it a ""restricted diet"" (mind you I wasn't binging before yesterday's incident so technically in my head I really convinced myself I was just dieting extremely)",Request: idk what's happening to me,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/i5at6b/request_idk_whats_happening_to_me/,1596814425,07-08-20 4:33

Me and my dad are waiting in the room and the doctor arrives and the first thing she said was “it seems you’ve lost quite a bit of weight were you trying to do that?” I responding with “yes” I was actually trying to lose some weight since I was overweight and now I’m classified as a healthy weight. There were some papers there for me personally to fill out while she asked me about my calories intake which I told her and she told me it was too low and asked me how I was feeling but I felt fine she dropped it after that. The papers asked me if I had tried starving myself or bingeing, purging, any type of disordered eating I looked at the yes checkbox and decided to skip the question and come back to it but after she asked me those questions about my weight and calorie intake I quickly went backed it checked the no box.... a few more questions later it asked me how often I thought about weight loss and had anxiety about food I checked the several days a week box, I gotta be kinda honest right? Then a nurse came in took my blood and I got some shots and I left. Later that day the doctors called back and I guess they told my parents that I had lost thirty pounds in a year and my blood sugar and vitamin  D was very low im a 16 year old girl that isn’t normal... and they wanted to see me again on Tuesday. That night I deleted myfitnesspal and decided to stop counting my calories and just eat what I wanted, and the the 3 meals now recommended by my doctor... I never ate breakfast but the next day I did and it honestly wasn’t bad except I had to wake up early to fit it into my day which was new since I usually woke up at 12:00 in the afternoon everyday, that day I didn’t track anything and I felt okay it kinda displeased me that I couldn’t count but I also wanted to be healthy I still hadn’t reached my “goal weight” but the doctors visit scared me and I’m pretty sure my parents are starting to think I have an eating disorder and maybe I do too.... I just don’t have the common symptoms I don’t ever starve myself as long as it’s in my calorie budget I’ll eat whether it be cookies or chips of course there are foods that I avoid like fast food but I feel like everyone who’s trying to watch there figure does that right? I don’t binge because it scares me to eat that many calories that’s not normal is it? I get a bit repulsed when I walk past foods in the store I deem unhealthy....

705,EDPostRequests,1596792743,i5asmg,"Hi, I was wondering if you'd be willing to post the below message? I had sent it to the EDPostRequests but noticed the post about that being a rarely checked account so I thought I'd try again. I hope I've done this correctly! Thank you!

I'm a 28 y/o female. Last year I lost a lot of weight from a combination of things: it started as a physical problem but after losing weight, I ended up exploiting the problem until I was restricting my food to very little a day. At the beginning, I was very very overweight and am still considered overweight, despite dropping close to 1/2 of my weight over the year. I was usually able to eat 'normally' around friends in order to maintain the facade, but otherwise, I was obsessive about what I ate, often ate the same things over and over, weighed myself daily, and lost a lot of hair. I passed out once or twice. I told my therapist and they didn't think it was a diagnosable problem, but then my friends held an intervention at the beginning of the year to tell me they thought I had an eating disorder. It shocked me into action and I started eating 'better', but really, I just became a binge eater.

I've been struggling with pretty serious mental health issues for a couple of years and have recently experienced a lot of change in my life. In the last few weeks, I started restricting again and now I feel like I'm on top of the world. My anxiety is gone, my depression is barely existent, I'm functioning better than I have in months. It's like this neutral state where I can get stuff done instead of being frozen in depressive or anxious states. It's made me take on a bunch of projects and I'm actually thinking about the future for the first time in years.

I don't know if I have an eating disorder, but I do know I probably shouldn't be restricting as much as I do. However, it's confusing because I'm grateful for the sudden, radical shift in my mood, but am worried that it's a temporary response that will disappear. And I really need it to stay.

Has anyone had this response before? Is this because I started restricting again? Will it go away if I were to stop restricting again? Do I really have a problem anyway if I was able to mostly stop for a bit? Thank you.",Request: Improved mood after falling back into behaviours?

Okay, so to cut the story short, all my life I’ve had severe issues with smell, texture and the look of most foods. I literally gag with certain textures or taste of 80% of foods I’ve ever tried.

How my brain processes food is like so... Does it look simple? If not, I won’t like it (and I’ve not even tried  it, but I’ve already said I won’t like it so I just won’t try it because  I feel like I know I already wouldn’t like it). Does it smell good? (Honestly, if there’s multiple scents coming from a  plate, it makes me gag). And sauces. I hate the smell on certain foods and the colours etc. I’m  23 and I’ve never ever tried any sauce and yes that means Ketchup,  mayonnaise and other common sauces.

Moving on to the good old hold your nose so you can’t taste it trick... If I can’t taste or smell it, the texture of the food will make me gag, for example; Chewy foods, Clunky foods like baked potatoes and others, Chicken, the texture and chewy texture makes me gag as soon as it touches my tongue.

I also hate the smell of a lot of foods too a point where if I smell  something which I don’t like, I’ll happily hold my breath until I’m far  away from the smell.

Honestly, I just don’t like food, nor do I enjoy it. I’m not anorexic or anything and I will eat foods that I’ve eaten for  many years, but I just don’t have the mental strength too try something  new as I immediately tell myself “that will make me gag or throw up.”

My BMI is ideal which is great, but my grandparents and father is  type 2 diabetic and if I get that genetically, there’s no way I’d  survive with the way I see food and think about it.

I just can’t bring myself to get over this. It’s not a phobia, it’s  just my senses make my mind up for me without trying something new. It  actually makes me feel nauseous just when I think about eating something  I’ve never eaten before.

Anyone else relate too me here? I can’t go out with friends and  family for a meal etc because I don’t have the capacity too store much  food in my stomach and I’m that fussy with foods, I feel embarrassed  most times and when I get nauseous, I’d rather just skip eating and  drink something fulfilling like milk.

Advice would be highly appreciated, I’ve had a tough few years with  my actual health (I have other disabilities but they’re not related too  this topic) which has really made me forget about the way I see food.  It’s come too a point though where I need to get a grip of my eating  habits as if I carry on, I won’t survive if I became diabetic and with  my diet, it’s inevitable, like for real.

710,EDPostRequests,1596699067,i4nc6q,"I (25F) just moved back with my mom after living by myself for 6 years due to covid. I’ve always struggled with eating well and eating the “right” foods and avoiding the “bad” ones. I even did my bachelors in nutrition because I wanted to know more and it was a topic I always felt drawn to. During my years in college I was very happy with my eating habits, I never felt guilty and exercised a healthy amount of time due to the fact that I was learning a lot and nobody shamed anybody about what you ate.

However, now that I’ve moved back in... I feel guilty every time I eat a chocolate, chips or if I just feel like eating some noodles for dinner. I started noticing that every time I eat a “bad” meal, my mom always makes fun of me saying things such as “wow you’re eating so healthy” or if she sees me grab a chocolate and a little bit later some chips, she would tell me to stop eating or raises her eyes when I go grab some snacks. She does the same when I don’t exercise as well, which of course makes me feel guilty even though deep down I know it’s healthy to take breaks and to not be so strict with your eating habits.

To be honest I don’t know where to begin to start healing again as I always feel ashamed of my body and what I eat while I’m living with her, I’m in a healthy weight and I’m an overall healthy adult but now food controls my life and I’m always struggling to choose what to eat.

711,EDPostRequests,1596699057,i4nc4w,"Yesterday I had my intake appointment at an outpatient ED clinic. It took several hours and I was nervous. I am an early thirties mom who is happily married and work a professional job. I was really afraid that they would tell me that I didn't have a problem and that I was just overeating like normal people do sometimes. I was worried that they would tell me that I was relapsing but that they had bigger fish to fry. 

I struggled a lot with binging and purging when I was a teenager while I was undergoing sexual abuse by my step-father. When I went away to college, things got better and I largely stopped purging. 

Recently (as is a shock to exactly zero people on planet earth) things have been stressful. A pandemic comes with its own stress, food insecurity in the form of gluten free foods being hard to locate for my family was stressful, and unexpected but happy miracle pregnancy was stressful (hey being pregnant during a pandemic isn't scary at ALL), and then finally, a horrible miscarriage that just wouldn't freaking STOP topped off the cake. Binging escalated, to be followed swiftly by purging. Nightmares of my abuse have been happening more frequently and I have been tired a lot, especially at night. 

Yesterday I received diagnoses of Bulimia Nervosa and PTSD. Honestly, I half expected them to tell me, ""It's a pandemic, we are all doing weird coping stuff, and we are all overeating."" Instead, they completely validated everything I have been feeling and let me know how glad they were that I came  in at the first signs of trouble. I still have two years of treatment ahead of me but I feel really hopeful. 

I am writing because maybe you are like me. Maybe you have been through some horrible stuff and come out stronger. Maybe you generally have a great life and feel like because you don't fit the ""mold"" you have in your brain for not being ""sick"" enough or ""profound"" enough that you don't deserve treatment. I went in yesterday half expecting them to laugh me out of the clinic. Ok not really, but I have been told before that I wasn't in danger, so they couldn't be bothered (Thanks to that police department for not prosecuting my abuser). Instead, they reassured me that I DO have a disease that deserves help and treatment. They reassured me that especially PTSD comes back again when your brain can handle it, aka, when your life seems pretty great. They reassured me that both of these things are things that respond extremely well to treatment.

So, I want YOU, yes you, to know that if you are wondering if your issue is bad enough, it probably is, or at least it couldn't hurt to find out.

I am fairly new to reddit and am not sure if this is the right sub at all, so I'm sorry if I'm wasting your time! Basically, my question is: Did I have an ED when I was a teenager or not? What I my post would look like:

When I was a teenager I was severely depressed and had an anxiety disorder, still have. I have been always chubby but not unhealthy and it never bothered me really. When I was about 13/14 my depression got really bad and I felt that eating was the only thing I could really control.

It started with cutting out any sweets and only eating healthy food. Then I would cut down on that, too to only eat once a day, maybe twice. My calorie intake wasn't high but not too low, I guess, I never counted. What I basically ate was like two toasts a day, at the weekend I treated myself to half a pizza. So it wasn't even healthy food, just not much. I then started to work out daily. I did lose weight but overall not much. I was in a pretty healthy body weight and maintained it.

Years later, I went into a psychiatric care for my depression and I told my psychiatrist how my eating habits were and that I would use it occasionally to punish me. (eg. wouldn't eat when I felt bad etc.) She then said to me, that this is not an ED because I am not underweight. 

That has been about 8 years ago. I am in a lot better place, gained weight, eating healthy, working out to get muscles etc. I still struggle with eating in front of people though. I want to start a new therapy for my still ongoing depression but I don't know if I should even mention my eating habits after being shut down by a professional before. And, furthermore, I don't know how/what I should tell my friends when they suddenly decided to eat out/order food when it wasn't planned because I don't like eating if it isn't planned,  it don't feel comfortable saying that I have problems with food or even a ED because of the reasons I mentioned.

So, did I have an eating disorder and should I ask to be treated for that as well?

So In 2014 (age 17) I entered the world of eating disorders. 
My vices were Extreme exercise and calorie restricting after months of this I lost a lot of weight very fast at my lowest weight was 55kg (120lbs) 5’8 active male. 

I loved how I looked and how I felt and looking back at the photos I still wish I looked like that.

I had gained a nice amount of wait after therapy in 2016 and since then I’ve had a lot of other anxieties including pure O ocd, they all seem like different control mechanisms. 
Now I seemingly have Pure o OCD under control, my weight has got to a all time high at 13 stone, I could stand to lose a stone or two in healthy ways.

I first felt my eating disorder coming back at the start of this year but now it’s peaking

But I feel the relapse coming on due to all these factors.

I have been struggling with compulsive overeating for a long time and over quarantine it’s triggered it even more. I know the cause is &gt;!emotional trauma/sexual assault/domestic abuse. !&lt;

Growing up I was severely neglected and my parents would often not buy food and I didn’t know when I was going to eat. When they did buy food it was unhealthy and a lot was fast food. So I would eat as much as I could so I wouldn’t be hungry. I would literally be so hungry I would eat spoonfuls of sugar or honey. I would often only have bread and butter to eat. I remember going to my grandmas house and being so hungry that I ate so much that I actually threw it up from overeating.
Over the past 12 years I’ve had  counseling,seen psychiatrists, and had treatment for all my medical conditions. I had lost a bunch and kept it off. Then in 2018, I had my first manic episode, I was in and out of the hospital and was jobless for four months. I got food stamps but it wasn’t nearly enough to cover my food and I ended up mostly starving because I couldn’t afford food and what I could afford I couldn’t keep down because of my mental illness. I have not had another manic episode in two years. However my overeating has gotten incredibly severe. I’ve gained back the the lbs I had lost and it keeps rising. 

I’m at a loss for what to do. I tried OA but it doesn’t really work for me and it ended up making it worse due to trauma triggers.

1) So... I have both OCD and Anorexia, and it just feels like a constant battle. The OCD doesn't seem to be directly related (it's more intrusive thoughts about harm) but I feel trapped between the two. When my OCD is really bad, the ED is practically non-existent. When ED is really bad, then my OCD is much less. A lot of what I have read about this is that as I get to my set point, the OCD should decrease and I guess I am wondering if anyone else can relate to this? It just feels like a game of whack-a-mole that I will never win :/

2) I identify as nonbinary (AFAB), and am on HRT. I don't want to lose more weight - I just want to look more masculine. I would be completely fine with gaining weight if it meant I looked more ""male"" but I feel like I never will, especially because I have this image in my head that is mostly unrealistic. I know that working out would help, but I find it super hard to get started and have anxiety surrounding even going to the gym (+ the fact I probably shouldn't be working out due to my weight rn).

Eventually I gained so much weight and it was very noticeable that I started to feel insecure. Once my government started to ease the lockdown, I began to jog few times a week and think about changing my diet. I learned about calorie in and out, and since then I’ve been using an app to count calorie. I never like running, so I felt like I would never burn enough calorie if I did not reduce my intake. That is when I started to significantly eat less. I would say 1200 calorie. I lost some weight and it gave me a tremendous satisfaction, being able to see result with some change. But I kept wanting more. Internet research sent me to the darker place. I learned about all kind of eating disorders. I watched documentaries. I studied the symptoms, but for the curiosity like how these girls managed to lost so much weight. I began to copy the behavior, find out how much calories these girls take in a day. I am still eating 800-1000 calorie now, because I don’t want to be too thin either.

The behavior that I have been adopting is:
- constantly counting calorie
- skipping meals
- restricting food (vegetarian diet, no bread, no potatoes, no ice cream, cakes, all kind of sugary snacks)
- purging (not often, only after i eat something I deemed unhealthy for the sake of socializing, like after going to restaurant with friends)

Sometimes I would also develop a strong urge to eat food that I am supposed to restrict myself from, like fried fish and cakes. I would then feel guilty and vomit it out.

I have a therapist but I never talk about this. Because I feel like is still harmless, my BMI is still around 19, I can still function, and this behavior sort of gives me purpose in life. Like I can wake up everyday and have a little project that I am looking forward to, which is eating healthier food and losing weight. It gives me sooooo much satisfaction to see the scale points to lower number. So I guess I need to keep this “little project” to sort of keep me sane. Weird but that’s what I think.

Between being born through sophomore year of college, I was always extremely fit and in-shape and underweight . When I met my now boyfriend, I started to eat a bit more and gained weight and I also stopped taking my birth control so that’s probably why I began to gain weight as so my doctor states.

My boyfriends parents and family have always been kinda weird with me and my parents absolutely adores me which made me depressed for a while. His sister called me the c-word and other names and calling me fat. His dad called me a fat-ass . Mind you they both don’t have abs and are overweight themselves but I’d never in my life say something so cruel and debilitating to someone and it’s not my business. They even told my boyfriend (who is overweight) that they would talk about me to each other about my weight. They are disgusting people. That was the straw that broke the camels back for me.

From then on, I’ve been watching and obsessing over my calories and always needing to be active and trying to watch my weight as much as possible. I also have major anxiety and I get panic attacks often because my boyfriend stopped talking to his dad and he showed up to our apartment in Florida and drove all the way down from Atlanta, GA with no warning and knew I was home alone.

My question is, I don’t eat all day until at night and when I do finally eat, I only eat a couple of bites or not much at all. I’ve been repeating that process for a couple of weeks.

My family doctor has been my absolute rock. She’s getting me the help I need and assured me that I wasn’t alone in this process. Honestly, she’s the only one making me not feel like crap for this. 

My family, however, don’t understand. When I told them my diagnosis, my father joked that he wished he had one so he could lose weight. I lost it at him, telling him how disrespectful it was. I asked him and mother (who I’m only staying with periodically during a visit, where I’m to our regulations have been lowered) not to comment on anything I eat or my size, but they won’t stop. My dad outright told me the other day I’d look better skinnier. It’s these comments that have drove me to not eating in the past. The majority of my friends have not been supportive at all. I know they’re going through a lot in their personal lives, but when I told them, it was met with “oh? I never would have guessed” or something along those lines... to me it makes me feel like because of my size right now that they don’t think there’s a possibility that I could have it.

So I counted calories, found exercise. Lost the weight. But sometimes it would come back. I asked my Dr for help, they said eat less, move more, get back to a healthy weight. My hair thinned, my Dr said it was from stress. My period vanished, my obgyn said it was my birth control. I got faint in an exercise class, my friend said yeah it was hot in there today.

I'm now gaining weight again. Only to find out it's due to 15 years of under eating, dieting, over exercising killing my metabolism. How can I forgive my friends, family and Drs for ignoring every cry for help, and continuing to encourage me to exercise more, and eat even less?

Enough was enough, I got myself a nutritionist and into therapy. I have been binge free since the day after the first day I met with my nutritionist (four weeksish ago). My weight has been stable, more or less, with even a slight downward trend, presumably from not binging. My nutritionist wants me to chuck the scale but I’m not there yet. 

Even with this progress...it’s so hard to contend with this weight gain. I see pictures of myself and literally can barely recognize myself. And it’s not just dysmorphia - there’s a real difference.

Hi guys, a little bit of background: I'm a long-distance runner and have fallen in love with marathon training. Over the course of 1-2 years, my love for running has slowly but surely gotten tied up with an obsession with calories, macros, weighing my food and portioning. This eventually got wrapped up with intermittent fasting, meaning I would be doing all my runs and strength workouts on an empty stomach, and then waiting until my ""window"" to eat. Even on my 3-hour runs, I would never take fuel gels, etc. with me. I've been obsessing over nutrition labels, etc., and would always check with MyFitnessPal to make sure I was ""under' my allocated calories as a buffer, just to be sure that I wouldn't gain weight/lose my physical aesthetic as a runner.

I've recently been working with a team of dieticians/psychologists, and while I'm not ""married"" to any of the following, they believe I'm definitely ""dating"" anorexia, bulimia (while not typically purging, using exercise as an ""out""), binges because of my restriction, and orthorexia.

Because of this, I've been put on a ""mechanical eating plan"" where I'm shift away from calories and macros and instead, count the number of starches/veggies/fruits/protein/fats I consume at predetermined times, which is all designed to fuel my training. While this all sounds good on paper, I can't help but feel like this is ""feeding the beast"".

My initial reaction to this plan to ""move away from MyFitness Pal &amp; counting"" was to build a spreadsheet to make sure I was hitting the count of starches/etc that were prescribed. If I'm under or over, I feel like a failure. My type ""A"" personality and perfectionist tendencies are honestly not built for plans like this....which makes me wonder...have any of you felt like this?

I'm currently wondering if I should just forego the ""plan"" and just go all-in. Eat what I want, when I want. Stop tracking, stop worrying about hitting meal numbers and ratios and just LISTEN. TO. MY. BODY. I feel like my personality and habits are just not well suited to follow a plan of any sorts, no matter the intentions...

Last night while we were drunk she told me she has been abusing laxatives for 2 or 3 years and she only poops like once or at most twice a week. she told me about a month ago she had been abusing them but I guess at the time I didn’t understand how damaging it is.

I kinda freaked out on the inside bc I didn’t want her to get them bc I know she’ll most likely abuse them bc of her addiction/ED. She knew I didn’t want her to get them bc I was clearly uncomfortable and hesitant when she said that but she said it’s worse if she doesn’t poop for any longer. I didn’t want to fight her on it plus she’s allowed to make her own decisions but i’m just really concerned for her health and I really want her to stop abusing laxatives. She’s expressed how she wants to stop abusing them so I want to help but idk how.

So ive had a eating disorder since i was young years old.(trauma related) Ive been through them all. Anorexia, bulimia, binge eating. Anything eating disordered ive been there.

When i met my boyf i was anorexic. This was over 10 years ago. I went through bulimia and binge eating since. Up and down in shape non stop. He acceptted it up till few years ago where binge eating took over and i put on extreme amount weight pretty quick in few years and i became pretty unhealthy. Im pretty tall lucky so its evened out over my body but im still alot heavy..

Anyway he started saying to me he was worried for my health and it wasnt healthy and i needed to exercise so we could go on walks together and i needed eat better and stuff and Didnt find me attractive anymore.

I agreed and i not happy how i looked or felt. I stopped binging pretty much at around xmas. Ive not binged once since. Ive lost alot weight. I wont say how much as im not sure a numbers allowed or not.

However heres the issue. My boyf says i look no different and recently text me saying i looked like id put all my weight back on and looked fat and unhealthy again. When what actually happened is id just been eating normally for few weeks for a break from loosing.i didnt loose or put on any weight in those two weeks.i staid exactly the same weight. In those two weeks i stopped reporting every other day id lost a bit weight to him. So i think psychology he made me fatter in his head?? After he sent that i cried and cried for ages. I felt my big weight loss had meant nothing if i still looked just how i did before.

If i eat he rolls his eyes and judges me for it. Which really doesnt help me.

I want to be healthy again but i still have binging urges constantly but im controling them but they are there daily.he has no idea how hard it is. He eats a big bar chocolate for pudding every day. I cant do that.

I have a few health disorders that make loosing weight harder too like pcos and underactive thyriod ect.

My mum saw me after not having seen me for multiple months and said i looked quite alot better. So i know it is visable and the scales dont lie. Niether do the photos.

I want to be healthy yes but i feel like theres alot pressure from my boyf and its making me feel really bad about myself. I should feel goid ive lost and im healthier. Im still classed as heavy so i have some more to loose but i should be pleased.

Loosing all i did isnt easy when inside you wsnt to binge so badly. I have so many in dealt with emotional issues. I just feel like i cant eat right now. Parts me is greatful because i want be healthier but part of me is really annoyed. Id like to enjoy having a snack and feel not judged about it once in a while.

I’m confused and scared. I have always had a pretty bad relationship with food and a significantly worse relationship with my body. (I used to do a lot of unhealthy things to lose weight and it was pretty bad, but it didn’t last very long.) 

These past couple months, It’s become impossible for me to eat, for a couple different reasons. It makes me feel horrible, so so horrible. Everytime, no matter how much or what it is, I can’t stand I gave any sort of relief/satisfaction to myself. I can’t stand not letting myself suffer. I started eating only once every couple of days. Not even to become thinner, mainly because I didn’t think I deserved it and I wanted myself to be in pain, along with getting rid of that sinking pit in my stomach after eating the smallest amount. This is the longest this type of thing has ever lasted. Every once and a while I would fall back into old habits but I would always “give up” and go back to eating normally. My motivations were different, my goal was different, a lot of aspects of it were different. This time I don’t see an end to it. And that’s horrifying. 

I am 00cle of eating very occasionally, and only to prevent overindulging in the future. I can’t talk about food. I can’t think about it. Any mention of food by my family or friends gives me that burning anxiety feeling in my stomach/chest. And it is f\*cking unbearable. It’s the worst it’s ever been by far. I have this overwhelming anxiety revolving anything about food and I am just so confused. Let me make this clear: I am not coming here saying I have an eating disorder, I doubt it. Who knows, in a couple of months theres a pretty good chance I’ll be back to eating “normally”. But even knowing that, I am just so frustrated with the state I’m in. And I can’t seem to get out.

RED-S, Running and Disordered Eating

Hi everyone, first post here so feeling unsure/not very confident in what I'm doing, but looking to hear from anyone who may be going through the same thing...

I'm a long-distance runner (approximately 40-50 KM/25-32 miles per week), and have fallen in love with marathon training. Over the course of 1-2 years, my love for running has slowly but surely gotten tied up with an obsession with calories, macros, weighing my food and portioning. This eventually got wrapped up with intermittent fasting, meaning I would be doing all my runs and strength workouts on an empty stomach, and then waiting until my ""window"" to eat. Even on my 3-hour runs, I would never take fuel gels, etc. with me. I've been obsessing over nutrition labels, etc., and would always check with MyFitnessPal to make sure I was ""under' my allocated calories as a buffer, just to be sure that I wouldn't gain weight/lose my physical aesthetic as a runner. I would never try to eat to ""maintenance' and have gradually seen food as an enemy/threat as opposed to fuel for my training.

Long story short, I started struggling with intense mood swings, fatigue, disrupted sleep, and in all honestly, probably an addiction to working out and my running schedule (despite not having any race to train for because of the pandemic). 

I've recently been working with a Sports Psychologist as well as a Dietician, who both have diagnosed me with RED-S (Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport).  They say that while I'm not ""married"" to any of the following, I'm definitely ""dating"" them: anorexia, bulimia (while not typically purging, using exercise as an ""out""), and orthorexia.

My restrictive approach has lead to binges on the weekends, because as soon as any one of my food rules gets broken, it's an opening of the flood gates and I will eat anything and everything, in almost a fugue state. I'm learning that this was just my body overriding my brain as it desperately tried to make up for the deficiency in calories throughout the week and essentially survive, but the guilt, shame, and disappointment with myself is definitely still there the next morning.

I'm only three weeks into my ""recovery"" journey...and I know I have so much work to do. I'm already experiencing extreme hunger and have no idea how to adjust to this new normal where my level of control goes out the window, and calories/macros are being replaced with food exchanges/etc. I cannot come to terms with cutting back my training/running as it truly is the only time I feel ""normal"" and is my mental relief during all of this...running is honestly my outlet, and without it, I fear I would go off the rails.

To wrap it up I'm feeling overwhelmed and lost. I'm wondering if:
- Any of you out there are athletes/runners who struggle with eating disorders, and RED-S in particular? How have you navigated this? 
- How did you step away from habits like weighing yourself/food/tracking every little thing? going cold turkey seems so scary - I want to make sure I am actually ""getting enough"" but don't trust my hunger cues at all at this stage/not even sure I have any at this point...
- How have you dealt with extreme hunger and the mental warfare that rages?
- Any and all advice is truly welcomed...I know this is such a deeply personal and emotional issue so thank you all in advance for your support and guidance.","Request: RED-S, Running and Disordered Eating",https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/i7036a/request_reds_running_and_disordered_eating/,1597064568,10-08-20 2:02

My girlfriend, before I began dating her was anorexic to the point where several times she had to be interned into a hospital. After a lot of psychiatric help and with the help of her family she was able to pull through and get much better. Still she did not eat well and was really skinny.

Then, 1 year after that we started dating and at that time I did not fully understood what she went through but i knew she had an eating disorder before. She was really closed down on this topic for a while because she said that she did not want to worry. 

Some months later she became my girlfriend and until this day we have a beautiful relationship (almost 1 year as my girlfriend). The first months as my girlfriend everything seemed normal until I went to a family trip. During the family trip, a friend told me that she did not go to school so I asked her. She answers and she is in the hospital and I kinda freaked out and cried in the back of my car during the road trip. I did not know that she was not eating so it was an intense emotional hit. Shortly after that, I invited her over to a lake house to spend the weekend. We had a lot of fun and we ate a lot as well. Even she ate a lot of food. Therefore, I thought that she was doing better. At night, she got a horrible stomach ache (like really bad and she was also shaking). So I took of her and kinda got mad at her because she had kept it hidden for so long. She went to sleep and in the morning she was better. We talked about it and promised that she would never make me go through that ever again. So she really made an effort and started to eat even if her brain tried not to eat. It was really harsh but she improved a lot. Until this day, she eats normally and has gained some weight ( now she is at a very appropriate weight).

Through the months, I invited her several times to the lake house and everything seemed normal. As we got to know each other more I learned to read her and I learned how to tell when she is lying. So the next time we went to the lake house I knew something was wrong. It was the stomach aches again but not as strong. I tried to help her and finally the stomach ache went away when she layed down on me. After that we talked some more and i realize that every time she came to the lake house she had that stomach ache at night. After some analysis I concluded that it was phsycological because she was really scared that the stomach ache would come. She could not stop thinking about it and every night outside her house she would experience this same aches. Still, after some comforting by my part one night she did not have any and from that day on she never had. It was really weird.

Now to the problem
She went to study a year of high school with his dad. So she arrives and everything is fine for about a week. She complains some times that the food they eat in his dads house is too greasy and unhealthy. One night she has another stomach ache and now she has them every night. I dont know what i can do to help because im thousands of miles away. I am really worried because this causes her to sleep less and be in pain. I also worry that this might become something that affects her physical health. I have researched everywhere and i not found good information on something like this. I really need some advice on what to do. I have become really anxious and need some peace of mind.

At the time it was pretty damaging to the ol’ self esteem I cannae lie, but obviously now I realise that actually we were a similar weight it’s just that she was taller and also like a chronic smoker from the age of like 17 so go off I guess. She’s also told me before that I eat like my grandparents and will end up like them which would be okay except, they’re morbidly obese and at the time I was a perfectly healthy weight. My mum and me dannae have a great relationship when it comes to my eating and my body image.
When COVID happened (I’m 18) I’d already been on a diet for like a month or two where I had been restricting too much but thought I was being healthy and okay (for some god forsaken reason) since I was doing intermittent fasting. I’m in the UK so I realised that I would be getting my A-level results based off of my trash mock results and my chances of uni were now uhhhhhhhhh lower. I’ve been really anxious all through lockdown. It’s been like constant anxiety for the past 5 months and my relationship with my mother has suffered since being so anxious for so long does make you pretty irritable. That linked with the amount of restriction I’ve done for the past 6 months straight has meant I’ve lost a large percentage of my body weight and I’m now underweight from being overweight.
This now actually leads me into the general question. I live at home so going to therapy or getting treatment in a family that doesn’t believe *I* can have mental health issues (specifically because that would get in the way of their plan for my future) can be difficult. I say family, I mean my mum. I can’t really tell my dad and not my mum because that would put him in a weird position and he’d refuse to lie for me especially if he knew my actual weight since he’d be worried. I’ve tried to contact my GP but they told me they can do one of two things, either refer me to the ED clinic (and getting to and from is difficult since I live at home with my parents) or just put me on meds. They’d also just give me meds over the phone as well without me seeing them due to COVID atm. I’m also pretty fuming because when I did call them and speak to them they told me that they’d give me some resources and they gave me, (an adult) ChildLine’s phone number for me to talk to them about my eating.
I don’t particularly know what to do, I don’t know really how to make sure I’m still safe and I couldn’t tell you how my physical health is doing. The only thing of mine which I can measure is my heart rate. I get some symptoms like irritability and bad sleeping and hair falling out and dry skin and sometimes I’m lightheaded (not very often mind you). Occasionally I get random pains in my side or in my chest (I think the chest pains are around my ribcage mostly not my heart). I don’t know what I should look out for or how to get taken seriously by the GP. They have this trashbag absolutely garbage rule that says that they’ll take ED patients who are underweight before they take ED patients who are a healthy weight or overweight and that’s so damaging but I’m now literally underweight and all I’ve been given is childline’s phone number.

so, the reason i’m posting this here is because i see a therapist and have learned through our sessions that i have some serious issues with trusting myself, to the point where i believe my emotions are fake/i’m faking my feelings/thoughts/whatever. because of this, i really need a second opinion, but i’m not at all interested in talking to my therapist (who i do seriously trust and appreciate) about my habits with food. 

essentially, growing up i’ve always had this thing (which is pretty uncommon, the mayo clinic has an article about it here: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rumination-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20377330) called rumination syndrome. i was never diagnosed, as i thought for a long time i had acid reflux, but it’s basically involuntarily regurgitating your food with literally no effort or autonomy shortly after eating.

for a long time, i used to swallow, but i began spitting just as quarantine started. this correlated with a time period in which i had seriously begun to hate my body (i always have, which also has something to do with my dysphoria as a non-binary person) and made it a goal of mine to lose weight. i had just begun intermittent fasting, and this seemed like an easy option to cut off a few extra calories. however, this eventually led to me also thinking, hey! why not make myself throw up sometimes?

so, i began doing that. i don’t binge, but i do often purge after eating food, first letting my rumination syndrome do what it does and then additionally making myself throw up the rest of my food. it’s become so that when i eat large meals i feel really depressed if i don’t purge afterwards. i’ve also begun to fast 2-3 days a week, and try to keep my calories to a certain amount everyday. i’ve lost a TON of weight in the past 3 months, but i still feel like it’s unlikely i actually i have an eating disorder, because i feel like it’s under my control, you know? like, it’s just me being selfish because i want to lose weight, it’s not like i actually have to. i don’t know. i guess i’m just posting to see if people agree? like, i’m not crazy to say that i don’t think i have an eating disorder?",Request: Post Request: Rumination Syndrome/Possible ED.

I would also do this when I was stressed. For some reason I never clocked that this may be a disorder. I thought I was just using weird coping mechanisms.

I've been struggling with a small list of physical issues which are making it very hard to gain weight on top of a long recovery from anorexia.

The motivation or even memory to eat throughout the day when I'm alone is near non existent.

I guess I'm wondering if anyone else well into recovery has noticed this too. It doesn't always seem like a conscious decision to not eat, but it's almost as if I can't bring myself to want to eat (even if I'm hungry) until there's somebody else eating as well.

I started losing right before going to college. I was what I would consider significantly overweight, but not obese. Anyway within a yearish I became noticeably and clinically underweight. Over the following three years I slowly started to gain and restrict less and less, until eventually food did not dictate my life. Honestly I just enjoyed it again. My weight since has fluctuated to healthy, like it was before college, healthy again, and back to over, but I just kinda ignored it when I was overweight. I lost some before my wedding a year ago, but was still in a very healthy range. 

Well as we know 2020 is a disaster and I fucked up and bought a scale for the first time since my early twenties. I only knew my weight lately based on doc appt, etc. in recent years. As it turns out I’m clinically overweight again. Now I know I will have nagging thoughts about wanting to be “thin” again on and off forever. But I don’t want to be that sick ever again. I just can’t seem to keep myself at a good weight... if I have to be mindful of eating less, I end up restricting. If I am not mindful I eat too much on a regular basis. Side note- I don’t like working out cause I over do it and it’s boring to me (gym), but I do love to to hike, play sports, etc. 

My mind is saying “well that’s been a fun few years of eating whatever, but you better get it together now”.

- Nearly every time I eat, I feel nauseous, and sometimes I vomit immediately after or a few hours later. 

- I’ve never been able to eat a “good sized meal”. Instead, I eat that same meal in small portions throughout the day.

- I either eat too little, or too much. There’s not much of an in between

- Ive been around the same weight for a few years now, and when I go over those certain numbers, I drink smoothies and water until I feel I’ve lost the weight.

i was extremely overweight growing up and due to a health condition caused by my weight, i joined WW to shift the weight. i am now a normal weight for my height and i have noticed that (of no fault to WW), my relationship with food has went from one extreme to another.

i find that i look forward to eating and am very stringent about when i do so. however i am restricting my calories far too much and i don’t feel comfortable eating anything that’s deemed more than around x points (small #) on WW. i am now far too anxious to eat much and my family have noticed and become extremely pushy and frustrated and are constantly nagging me to eat more. if i try, i just get anxious and have even been brought to tears at how stressed i am at the prospect of eating.

i have seen my GP and she has referred me to counseling. however, i feel as if i still need to make changes in the meantime. i cannot afford to see a dietician/nutritionist, so this is my best (and uneducated) bet.

i do not feel comfortable coming off any kind of diet/tracking system completely. i have considered coming off of WW entirely and using myfitnesspal to count calories. the main benefit is not considering points when eating may help me eat different things and potentially increase my calorie intake (gradually, of course, as i can imagine my metabolism is too damaged to go up to my TDEE maintainence number so quickly anyway) and along with counselling, may help my damaged relationship with food. when i proposed this to my family, they were very against it due to my success on WW.

Hi all. I've had an eating disorder for over 10 years. I managed to get it somewhat under control but the last year or so has been very unhealthy for me. For the first time I'm binging excessively but purging less frequently so I have gained weight. I am still at a ""normal"" weight but I no longer look thin (as in my bulimic phase) or fit (orthorexic phase). My life is a bit all over the place right now and the purging has started to become more frequent as a result but it really takes it out of me these days. I don't know if it's just because I'm older now or what but it takes a full day to feel somewhat normal again. 

I'm terrified that I'll be in this cycle for the rest of my life where I get better, come across somewhat normal, things go to shit in my life and I revert back to my old coping mechanisms (which don't even make me thin anymore). I feel too old to still be struggling with the same issues I had as a teenager. I also feel like a failed human being because I can't even eat properly - it's such a basic, fundamental thing and I just can't do it.

I've tried therapy. I also saw my GP again pre-pandemic and they told me there's nothing they can do as I'm not currently underweight. I'm not sick enough to be at risk of dying from this, I guess, but I'm not well enough to have a proper life either. I honestly don't know how to pull myself out of this limbo anymore.

I’m pretty nervous to post this. I was diagnosed with anorexia at age 14 and have been to inpatient treatment on three different occasions. The disorder has definitely evolved and changed since the time of diagnosis, but something that has remained mostly consistent is that I want to be able to eat a lot. Like I feel very happy when my meal plan gets increased. The other thing is that I can. Eat A LOT that is. Volume isn’t an issue for me, in fact, I’d rather eat high volume. Despite this, I have remained - for the most part - very underweight and have never met my goal weight. The main issue for me (as far as I can remember) has been with exercise. I would exercise literally the ENTIRE day. I would still be eating a lot though. In fact, I was afraid to restrict below a certain number because I didn’t want to pass out. Over exercise was like the rationalization I used to allow myself to eat. In the past year, I have developed more restrictive tendencies as well as struggled with eating regularly. I had to do ALL the exercise first and finish all of my homework and anything around the house before I was “allowed” to eat (which ended up being like 7 or 8 pm.

As soon as I reach the weight I was at before the eating disorder started, I ramp up exercise so the gaining stops. When that gets unmanageable, then I guess the restricting starts. But that happens very minimally. For example I was supposed to be eating xxx calories - and I was. Then after I few weeks I somewhat subconsciously made that lower, then after a few months lower, then after many months I just started having to leave at least something of what I was eating. When I was weighed and found out my weight was like 6 pounds from my previous admission weight, it was like a switch flipped and I did everything in my power to lose as much weight as possible. I was eating like yyyy calories (in a common dieting range) and exercising 7 hours a day. After a couple weeks doing this I was admitted to inpatient because my heart was extremely unstable. Now I’ve been discharged and am planning to go to residential because things are already getting hard again. I guess what I’m wondering is....is this really anorexia? I see all the people on here who seem to really struggle to eat physically and mentally and don’t eat for days at a time or eat an extremely low calories a day and I guess that’s my idea of what anorexia is supposed to be. Maybe I’m just incredibly confused.

I’ve been in ED recovery for 4 years and have been working at a grocery store for 3+ years during that time. I was away from work for 3 months recently due to the pandemic, which is the longest I had been away. During that time, I got over my compulsion to overeat. I was a bit too focused on my body... but I genuinely had a really healthy relationship with food. But when I went back to work after a few weeks, I got triggered and here I am stuck again overeating junk food.

I’ve heard before that being in a grocery store with an ED is like an alcoholic working at the liquor store but I’ve never gotten anyone to validate that claim. I can’t decide whether to leave my job for good or not and if it’s possible to work there and have control over my disorder.

Hi all,

Here is my situation:

* I'm 40
* smoked weed a lot (3.5g per week) pretty much the entire 20-28 y.o. period. Weed was giving me the munchies, like everyone, but i usually managed to handle it well during my awake time but after going to bed, mental defenses went down and I would wake up many times within 20-60 mins after going to sleep, and head straight to the kitchen. I could eat cheese, ice cream, granola bars, cereals,drink coke, chips, olives... in no particularly order. I would wake up and my stomach would feel like crap,. obviously... but I was young so always managed to recover
* fast forward to today, I'm 40 yo. Couple of kids. Don't smoke weed anymore. But I still get the night binging. Not as bad as when I smoke weed (I almost never smoke anymore but when I do - OMG the binging is even worse than before)
* I'm xxx lbs. Not obese - but could definitely lose weight
* my entire life I've been an impulsive eater - put me in front of a bag of chips and it's really hard for me to stop reaching in. I don't even notice im doing it. I can eat and eat and eat until I start to feel sick to my stomach. This is due to my upbringing (was never thought to control urges - grew up in household with ""if you want it to can have it"" mentality)
* I feel totally trapped - the only way to get a good night sleep is when I sleep in a hotel room with no food in the room. At home, I get up almost every night, eat all sorts of shit. Only night where I don't is usually on Saturday, due to a week long sleep deficit. My body just sleeps through the night (not always) And I always feel like crap the next morning. I have terrible, terrible sleep due to this bad habit and it's taking a solid toll on my health.

I recently successfully managed to stop smoking cigarettes once and for all (i fought the stop-start smoking again battle for 10+ yrs...) and ery proud of it. I'm now resolved to get rid of this habit and reclaim my health, but don't know where to start.

I was super upset and told her she needs to stop. I had no idea about eating disorders back then, so I know I didn't handle it well. The thing is, I have always been an emetophobic to the point that the idea of vomiting triggers anxiety attacks. So it makes me distraught that someone I love so much is constantly suffering with purging. 5 years later, I have only mentioned it once or twice by asking her if it is still going on. She doesn't talk about it, but she has told me not to tell our parents (who are very supportive) because she doesn't want to go to therapy but she knows we can afford it because I went to therapy (ironically, I had to go to therapy for my emetophobia). She's lost a lot of weight, but she's still in a healthy range, so I don't think anyone who isn't constantly with her has noticed. She goes to the bathroom after every meal still, and acts self-conscious when she comes out. She used to have an obsession with exercise.
Now, she exercises a normal amount, but only eats one or two small meals a day, and usually drinks a lot of coffee and calls it a meal. She also drinks a lot, and that worries me because I know she hasn't eaten enough to process the alcohol. She has always had heart problems and panic attacks.

I don’t have anyone to ask so I’m just going to lay all my cards on the table and hope someone can point me in the direction of an answer. 

I think I have an eating disorder or at least something that’s leading to one. I’ve never been a skinny girl but I’ve also never been obese. I have always been definitely overweight, though. Ive hated how I look in the mirror for years and my relationship with food is so fucked up that I can’t even lie to myself about it anymore. I think about food and my weight almost constantly- from the moment I get out of bed to the time I go to sleep. I think of how many calories are in foods, when to eat, when not to eat, what is that food going to do to my body, it’s going to make me fat. I also have to weigh myself every day or not knowing eats my thoughts up completely. 

It gets to a point where I just don’t want to eat anything but I usually break around dinner time and eat a meal and a dessert, but I definitely don’t eat enough for it to be considered a binge. It’s either a normal sized meal or a small portion depending on my mental state that day. 
However, even though I don’t eat nearly enough for it to be considered bingeing, I obsess over what I ate so much after finishing a meal that I feel compelled to throw up. And I do. This happens mostly once a day because I usually only eat once a day. But sometimes I eat small snacks and don’t feel compelled to throw up. Other days I feel like I need to purge even the smallest snack I eat. Regardless, after I throw up what I ate, I feel accomplished and proud that I got the food out of my body and got rid of the sick feeling. On days I lean more toward restricting food, I feel so proud when I’m laying in bed and my stomach is growling. Either way, there’s always some sort of obsession over food that seems to be playing on loop in my head. 

I also exercise 6 days a week for at least 90 mins. The workouts aren’t always super intense but if I are more than I thought I should I definitely ramp it up. I feel incredibly guilty after taking a rest day or eating too much on my day off. 
I’m a freshmen in college, but have had these thoughts since my sophomore year of high school. I did exercise almost obsessively but school tended to keep me occupied enough to keep my mind off of food. However, it has gotten significantly worse since quarantine started in March. Some days I feel like I’m spiraling out of control and others I feel like I’m making this all up in my head and nothing is wrong with me. 

I tell myself that if i just lose 15 or 20 more pounds I’ll be happy with how I look. I’ll have the flat stomach and lean thighs that I desperately want, but truthfully that’s what I told myself 25 pounds ago and I still hate how my body looks with a fiery hatred some days.

I only know of three EDs and I don’t think what I have can be called any of them. Not bulimia because I don’t binge, not anexoria because I do eat, and not binge eating disorder because, again, I don’t binge. So really, I have no idea if what I have falls under any category at all.

800,EDPostRequests,1597572322,iapw07,"Hello everyone,

This is kind of a tough post to submit because just right now am I starting to face the fact that I might have an eating disorder after I nearly flipped out after a bad number on the scale after weighing myself for the fifth time today. For some background, I am an 18 year old male who is an avid runner and I am according to my doctor at a very good weight 

It really doesn’t feel that way at all though. Everyday I take off my shirt and look it the mirror and try to see how bad my stomach looks. If I eat a big meal, I always look in the mirror in disgust looking at my full stomach. My weight fluctuates a lot week by week, day by day, but if I’m ever at a higher number than I like it ruins my day. Since lockdown started, I’ve only been given more of an opportunity to obesely weight and judge myself 

I feel like I eat a crap ton of food too and often have to calculate how many calories in a day I eat. As a runner, I have a big appetite but it feels like I’m never full and if I don’t stop myself I’m going to get super overweight really quick 

Sorry if I’ve been rambling on a lot, but I guess the point is that I have a grave fear of overeating to the point where I’ve become absolutely obsessive about checking my weight. Before the virus, I could live my life without having time to worry about my weight but now that I’m always at home my mind is taken up by thinking of it. I wanna let this feeling go so badly but at the same time I’m still so scared Im going to become overweight if I’m not monitoring my body every day. Thankfully Im leaving for college in a couple weeks and I won’t have access to a scale, but I know I’m probably going to be looking at myself in the mirror to check my weight every single day...

My (23) gf (24) has an eating disorder. She’s admitted to me that she often purges, takes laxatives, or just plain starves herself in an effort to lose the weight she thinks she needs to. I’m not even being biased when I say she’s a 10/10. She’s perfect, and I’d love her no matter what she weighed or any psychical attribute. She’s my baby. Even physically, I know any guy would give their left nut for even a chance with her. It’s hard for me to understand how she views herself, but as someone who struggles with my own set of mental illnesses, I understand things are not always that clear cut.

I just want to know how I can be the best partner I can for her. She’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me, and I want to be as equipped as possible to help her.

I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to do that? I really can’t think of a way.

I just binged today. Before noon. Ate a lot. I am satisfied. I feel In control. I ask myself why did I binge? I now know the reason. I had all these snacks in the pantry and everyday I restricted myself to eating them. No, they aren’t the healthiest, but you can still have one or even two as a nice treat or snack . These are childhood staples and I missed how they tasted, I wanted to experience it again and fully quench my hunger. I am not a doctor, this is just my experience and how I understand why I binged and how I can strive to get better in the future. I am not a fully recovered person. Maybe I will binge again. My mentality is not the healthiest. But I do realize that having only a few snacks is probably the best for me right now just because I don’t think I will be fully in control for a while.

I would really like some insight from people who have been diagnosed with an eating disorder to see if what I’m experiencing is indeed the same thing.

I started intermittent fasting for my insulin resistance this year and have lost a lot of weight from it and am now finally close to a healthy weight for my age/height. I have been following the one meal a day (OMAD) plan. Whenever I eat even a small snack during my non-eating hours, I feel like I need to just not eat the rest of the day to save myself from the mess-up. I feel so guilty after eating large portions or having snacks. I've even stopped planning out nutritious meals as I did when I first started. I go so long without eating and then at random times I’ll go absolutely crazy and “binge” on anything I can find. If I end up eating out I’ll take laxatives to (unsuccessfully) counteract the weight gain.

I don’t really obsessively count calories, I don’t NOT eat every day...I just feel like I know I’ll make quick progress if I don’t eat so when I DO eat I feel guilty/like I’m screwing myself over.

He bullied me for eating honey and says fruit is unhealthy so now i worry overeating (i know its dumb but it makes me feel crazy) i have broken my eating rules to enjoy i few days out...but i cant relax, i end up crying looking at or thinking about food if i cant eat “good things” and fear ill ruin my body (after a few of those days im feeling angry as i feel i have). 

I thought id ended this by leaving his house and moving home but yesterday after a last minute outing where id ate completely clean to lose those foods and completely clean that day...we ended up eating out and i was moody in the queue and ended up crying in the restaurant as my favourite food was there but I couldn’t eat it...it was unhealthy and shameful and id already “pigged out” a few days before so choosing healthy or that ate me inside. 

I ended up giving in as i should be able to enjoy outings but..looking at it made me sick with how gluttonous it was and later i was angry with myself and felt fat.

I have been recovered for a few years. Mostly Bulimia/EDNOS. To most people, I have it all. I have been in a great place the last year, specifically. I landed my first big girl job, stayed in regular therapy, and I haven't purged in 2 years or over exercised/taken laxatives etc since then. My mate is an amazing cook and I've indulged in many meals I wouldn't have been able to eat before that I'd previously ""banned"" from my diet.

That being said...working from home is putting me in a bad place mentally (like most) since the pandemic started. The stress of it all is too much to bear at times. I feel like because I won't see anyone that nothing even matters anymore. I feel sad all the time. I wear sweatpants constantly. Showering is an accomplishment. I majorly overeat from stress and I am currently at the highest weight of my life and I'm struggling really, really bad. So I feel like nothing matters, yet all I can do is think about my weight and how fat I feel. I miss my old clothes and I feel like I have totally given up on myself. I haven't purged or done any compensatory behaviors but I have the urge to. Really bad. I have the urge to fast after large meals. Or run. This is the first time in my life that I am watching my weight go up like this. I miss my ED because I feel like I've given up on myself entirely. I'm open to any advice to anyone who can help me.

First post/question here.I struggle mainly with both annorexia and binge eating for thirteen years. I went to treatment in 2017. Was doing well for about a year but started struggling again.  

For the past two weeks I have been following a meal plan as I did in treatment. My issue is I seem to be very hungry in between meals and snacks throughout the day. It feels to me like either my metabolism has sped up from eating regular meals and snacks or my body is getting used to not binge eating. I try &amp; eat a snack(like recommend in treatment) when I feel like that but it doesn’t seem to fully satisfy.

My sister (18F) is anorexic  and has recently gone through a breakup, triggering disordered eating  habits. Her recovery has had its ups and downs but has been in a good  place for the last year or so, from what she’s expressed and from what I  can tell. Well, with the new turn of events, She won’t seek treatment,  and my parents are having a problem getting her to eat. She lives at  home and I live in the same town close by. I’m much older (30F) and she  has historically been very open and receptive to my wanting to help. I  think my house has always been a safe space for her and it hasn’t been  up until now that she’s ever resisted my help. We are very close and we  can usually talk through things. Recently, she was at my house and we  sat down for dinner but she said she wasn’t eating. I tried talking to  her but she got very angry and I didn’t want to upset her further so we  dropped it and I tried later but this time it resulted in a full blown  tantrum. She was going to spend the night but asked to leave. Today, she  asked to come over for the week and I said yes. I guess I’m just not  sure what to do. My gut (and likely incorrect) reaction is to tell her  she can’t come over if she’s going to act out the way she did last time,  but I don’t know what I would do if she refused to eat the whole time.

I have anorexia and I've had it since I was really young. It's not like I want to lose a lot of weight or I feel sick after eating, but I don't eat ""enough"" and I'm balancing on that fine line of having an average weight to being underweight. I don't really like eating. Neither do I like the feeling of a full stomach (it feels so heavy). So I used to stop eating before I was completely full. I was never super underweight and I was pretty healthy. But then, I kept hearing comments like, ""Oh my gosh, you don't eat enough"" or, ""Wow I wish I could be as skinny as you"". I know they were words of concern and compliments, but those words gives me so much stress. I eat enough to be both happy and people won't worry. I mean, at least I eat. Hearing words like that made me think like I'm not trying enough and I should just force myself to eat. I guess I could've.. if people didn't tell me they wanted to be as skinny as me. I don't get why people want to be as skinny as an anorexic girl, but I guess I never told them I'm anorexic. People kept calling me so skinny and after a while, I was that ""skinny girl"". This made me sorta proud that I have something people are jealous of. It seems strange, but I never really had a lot of things to be proud of. Due to this, I started getting worried.

My mom has always been a VERY picky eater. She doesn´t like any kind  of condiments or spices on her food, and is very strict about it.  If  you touch food with an utensil that has been in contact with anything  that she doesn´t like, she will not eat it, even if the part that was  touched is removed. She doesn´t eat most vegetables (except potatoes,  pumpkin, and onion), and she also dislikes some meats, unless they are  cooked just the way she likes them. She has been like this since she was  a kid, which is weird given that my grandma cooks a large variety of  meals, and is the complete opposite of my mom when it comes to food and  cooking.  On top of not eating a large variety of foods, my mom has never eaten  large quantities of food either. Sometimes, she´ll skip various meals at  a time, saying that ""she´s not hungry"", and drinking a cup of tea with  two or three cookies instead. My parents are divorced, and when I´m with  her she eats most times, but when I go to my dad´s ( usually for three  of four days a week) she hardly eats anything. When I get back, and open  the dishwasher, there´s only 5 or 6 cups and glasses, but no plates or  cutlery, meaning that she doesn´t eat whole meals. She´s told me  multiple times that sometimes she eats only because she´s dizzy, but  that she doesn´t feel hungry at all.  Last year, she went on a 15-day trip by herself, and came back with 3 or  4 kilos less, which is a lot, given that she´s medium height and pretty  skinny as it is.  Two days ago, she had an operation (appendectomy, nothing serious), and  was given some meds. The doctor made special emphasis on her eating  before taking them, since they could make her stomach hurt if she didn´t  do so. (this comment was totally random, since he didn´t know about her  eating habits.)  Yesterday, when it was time for her meds, she refused to eat before  them, claiming, once again, that she wasn´t hungry, even though she knew  it could have negative consequences. She ate some cookies and some  dinner later, which wasn´t much for the regular adult, but above average  for her.  Today, after lunch, I offered her a cup of tea, to which she said yes,  and a small piece of cake, to which she replied ""I´m too fat for that"".  She is, in no way, overweight, and I may even dare say that she´s  underweight, and the frequency in which she makes these comments is  worrying.  I told her repeatedly that she should change her eating habits, but it  hasn´t changed anything.

I was quite obese from about the time I was 14 'til was 22. Last year, my mom pressured me to get a liposuction. She paid for everything and the whole ordeal was pretty safe and went without any trouble. However, 2 months after that, I found out I had gained 6 pounds. Now, mind you, the reason why I was fat (apart from my depression) was my constant overeating, but never in my life had I ever found myself late at night, heaving over the toilet because I had ingested a disgusting amount of food over the course of the previous hour.

I had read about people dealing with increased anxiety related to eating after this type of surgeries but is it really the root of this relatively new problem for me? The thing is, last year, I also did coke once and now I'm wondered if that might've also fucked with my body.",Request: The cause of binge eating,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ikhdxc/request_the_cause_of_binge_eating/,1598975314,01-09-20 4:48

This went on for years, and I was overweight. For the past 8 months, I’ve been losing weight in a healthy way and now I’m a normal weight. 

Now here’s my concern - I also have diagnosed OCD, so I’m a bit obsessive about most things. Now that I’m at a healthy weight, I’ve started having really strong impulses to work out. I will workout for maybe an hour or so, and feel the urge to do it again as soon as I’m done. I’ve talked about it with my therapist but she’s not focused on ED and we never really got into my BED because I downplayed it tbh. So she doesn’t see an issue with wanting to workout so much, as long as I can resist the urge. (Which most of the time I can.) I guess she’s seeing it from an OCD perspective. My concern is that I’m also starting to secret eat again, I want to all the time but I only give in occasionally. Has anyone been in this type of situation before? Is it I just don’t know what’s healthy? Or my OCD is kicking up?

848,EDPostRequests,1598869559,ijvi9t,"Hey everyone, thanks in advance for reading this. It's kind of hard to explain everything while still following this subs rule's, but I'll do my best. Anyways this all started back in the beginning of quarantine, when I realized the number on the scale was higher than it had ever been. I decided to start a diet for the first time in my life with my goal weight probably not being the most healthy weight for my body.

The thing is, the majority of my life I've been underweight without intentionally trying to be. I think this was partly due to the fact that I never really knew how to cook good food until a couple of years ago when I met my now-boyfriend, and also due to the fact that I was in a horribly toxic and abusive relationship, so food was never my primary concern. 

Anyways I wasn't able to stick to my diet...I was waking up at 3am with hunger pangs so bad I HAD to eat something just to be able to fall back asleep. After about three months I slowly started putting the weight back on, and while I'm not back to where I started I'm agonizing over every single pound. There's a number that I'm so terrified to hit, and the closer I get to it the more I feel like a failure. 

I think the absolute worst part of this all though is the fact that I can't fit into a lot of my old favorite clothes. I love fashion in general, and the fact that I can't fit into some of my favorite pairs of jeans kills me. I know I should probably just get rid of them, but I keep telling myself that I was able to fit into them at one point without feeling like I was starving myself, so maybe I can get back to that. 

I just feel like starting that diet broke something in my brain, and now I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I have an eating disorder necessarily, but I'm obsessively thinking about every meal and how much I eat, when I eat, how much I've gained, etc. I just want to feel normal again :/",Request: How to stop thinking about food and being sad that I can't fit into my old clothes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ijvi9t/request_how_to_stop_thinking_about_food_and_being/,1598891159,31-08-20 5:25

I’m 28 and was officially diagnosed with bulimia last year (even though I know I’ve had it since college) and was advised to go into an intensive 12 week outpatient program. I was too nervous to do it so I didn’t but I can tell I’m spiraling and I don’t know how to stop it. 

I’ve been fluctuating in my disorder where I don’t do any bad habits,  but then I want to lose 20 pounds (yes I need to), and then I get into exercising 7 days a week, counting every calorie and using laxatives everyday to flush food out. I know it’s gotten worse because I sneak and get phentermine from a doctor online which suppresses hunger. 

I’m on that track now where I constantly check progress pics of people, reading how to diet, checking the scale everyday... and I’m at my parents house in a different state and I’m down to 5 pills and I’m having a breakdown because I’m worried I can’t get more in time. They have no idea what’s going on. 

It sounds like I’m rambling and all over the place but I really don’t know what to do. I always say it will stop once I lose the weight, but then I lose it and nothing changes or I gain weight back and cycle all over again. 

I’ve called two therapists and none have returned my calls. I literally don’t know what more I can do. This disorder is affecting my life badly. I can’t have relationships because I don’t want them to know about me, I don’t even want children anymore because I’m terrified of gaining the weight and not being able to lose it.

I've tried getting help for my anorexia and this general aversion to eating that I have, but everywhere I go, no one will help me (including resources/websites I've been given from here) unless I'm already seeing a therapist.. the problem with that is that I have to wait until October until I'm able to see one. I've tried everything to get help sooner, but no one will help me. I indicated that I've been on and off being suicidal but I don't really plan on killing myself.. and when I do that everyone tells me to contact an emergency number.. I don't want to do that because I don't want to go back to a hospital. The reason for that is because I was forced to be on a horrible drug that I've desperately tried over and over to get off of but can't, called Mirtazapine.. I can't really trust the hospital anymore, especially given the poor treatment I've been given.

I should mention in case it's relevant to the answers you give, but I'm a 22 year old trans girl who has been on hormone replacement therapy for a year now. The answer to this question might be a bit difficult since apparently no one wants to study trans people and there's little research on us..

I'm stuck with my eating disorder for now.. and I've done all I can to try to eat more but can't.

i don’t have an ed, but i’m afraid i’m in danger of developing one. 

i’m a 19 year old female with a history of other mental health problems, if that matters. 

i’ve danced for the past 9 years. the past few years it’s been 5 days a week, 8+ hours a week. i was mostly muscle and i hadn’t  had body image issues since i was a kid. but then covid happened so my dance classes were moved to zoom, and were shorter and less intensive. then i stopped dancing all together after i graduated high school. my muscles started deteriorating and i started gaining weight. it wasn’t that big a deal until i noticed my face had gotten rounder. 
i started counting calories to try maintain my weight, then i decided to start trying to get back to where i was before i started gaining. i counted on and off for a couple months. i knew it wasn’t healthy, but i was afraid of gaining any more. 

i don’t know if it’s because school starting is stressing me out or what but it’s been bothering me a lot more the last few weeks. half of the time i think there’s nothing wrong with my body and i’m okay with my face, and the other half of the time i hate everything about my appearance. i started counting consistently last week and i’ve gradually lowered the amount i allow myself to eat. i’m still above the triple digits, but i’ve lost an alarming amount of weight since i started-
but i don’t really want to stop. 

i don’t know if i’m just trying to invent more problems for myself or if this is real. all i know is that i forced myself to eat a bag of potato chips today and i wasn’t filled with guilt, but i felt... wrong. like i know i’m not eating enough but to eat anything more feels wrong. 
i just want to know how worried i should be, and if this is something i should be scared of, what to do about it.

For some background I’m 17 F. I feel like I have always had the correct amount of food for myself, I would usually have enough so I would be satisfied. Most mornings I will wake up at about 9-10am and I’ll be really hungry however I won’t eat. I’ll feel like I could eat but I’ll wait and eat lunch because I like the “morning skinny”. It probably sounds stupid but I prefer how I look then. Even then I will eat a very small lunch and dinner though I will be hungry. I used to eat a small snack at night before going to sleep but now I don’t, I just drink some water and sometimes some fruit. I’ll drink coffee in the morning and joke about how it’s a meal replacement but nobody that I live with really recognizes it. I don’t know if they aren’t saying anything because it’s not really an eating disorder and I’m just being dramatic or if I really am developing one/have one.

869,EDPostRequests,1599523344,ioj50e,"Hello,
I've recently started a relationship with someone who's in the process of recovering from an eating disorder, specifically anorexia. She's great and I love her a lot, but her struggle with recovering is putting somewhat of a strain on me. I'm currently in recovering from EDNOS but my recovery process wasn't typical; I just kind of quit cold turkey and have been going strong for about a year now.
I've been reading up on how to best support somebody with a (basically) active ED but I figured actually receiving advice instead of reading articles would also be helpful.
The biggest issue is that my S.O. has told me that she lies while she's in her ED, so it's difficult for me to gauge if she's alright. For example, if I text her and ask if she's doing okay that night in terms of behaviors and she says yes, it's possible (and I'd say likely) that she's actually done something. She also alternates between being very gung ho about recovery (which I encourage) and a very defeatist attitude (i.e. ""I'm just going to get sicker until I need to go to treatment). I'm trying to support her as best as I can, and I don't want to make this all about me, but I don't know how to best help besides not commenting on her size even if it's positive. Like I said earlier, my recovery process looks very different from hers, and I want to encourage her recovery without babying her or making her feel like she's constantly being monitored, but I also don't want to accidentally enable her behaviors.
If anyone has any advice, please let me know, thanks.",Request: How to best support significant other?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ioj50e/request_how_to_best_support_significant_other/,1599544944,07-09-20 19:02

Seriously, I stay in bed as long as possible to avoid that mental fog, physical bloat and feeling like my skin is literally stretching to accommodate what my brain has convinced me is an extra 15 lbs. It SUCKS. I usually “punish” myself on days like this: restrict my eating and find a way to sweat/exercise as much as possible. It’s my way of purging without purging, but we all know that only perpetuates the cycle. So I’m looking for mental and physical alternatives. Anything work for you guys that you think I should try?

874,EDPostRequests,1599512759,iog4ob,"I want some advice. 

My history: I am 33 now. I restricted for many years. Eventually I started binging. Since this led to weight gain, I kind of freaked out and found a dietician who specializes in eating disorders. I have been working with her for about four years now and learned a lot about developing a more neutral attitude about my weight and not trying for an easy fix. I stopped having the crazy binges I used to have, but still do small binges when I feel overwhelmed. I started therapy about a year ago, though it hasn’t been very helpful. I also see a psychiatrist and am taking a mood stabilizer and an SSRI. 

My question: Over the last four years, my weight has increased steadily to the point where I am legitimately obese. This interferes with my ability to exercise (I love sports) and also affects my energy level and generally contributes to me feeling down. I want to lose weight and my dietician has been trying to help me by coaching me on meal planning. However, it’s just not working. I am too impulsive and disorganized and honestly exhausted about food to stick to a moderate meal plan. Also, for whatever reason, even when I feel like I am eating a reasonable amount, my weight keeps goes up. My dietician has told me that some people are just wired that way and those people need to be very organized about their eating to lose weight. This week, I told my dietician that I want to stop seeing her since I feel like I have too many appointments between her and the therapist and we’re going around in circles anyway. She agreed. Now I’m trying to figure out what to do next since I still would like to lose weight. I have accepted that dieting is a bad idea for me, but the sensible meal plan method doesn’t seem doable with my temperament. I have tried stimulants for ADHD but started abusing them to lose weight so I don’t think that’s an option (also my psychiatrist won’t prescribe them to me anyways).

Okay so I’ve been having this on my mind lately and always have but there’s times I think I’m just overreacting and feel like its going to get in my head so i just forget about it and don’t pay much attention to it. Since last year i used to struggle with depression and i hated myself a lot and i thought i was ugly and fat so i decided that maybe if I lost weight i would be more attractive. I started counting calories eating only healthy foods and would exercise as much as i could. After a few months i somehow just stopped and forgot about it and ate again,but again these past few months I started eating way less. 

I don’t eat much and if i do its only a small piece of fruit or when im forced to eat by my mom. I can’t eat nothing that has bread without feeling bad about myself. So as long as i don’t eat bread, anything with oil or just eating out I’m okay. I weight myself frequently every morning, after I exercise and if I eat I’ll weight myself. Whenever I’m forced to eat I will just space out and just be bumped out about it and be like “why did i eat that” however as long as it was either fruit or some type of vegetable and as long as it’s a little bit i won’t feel bad about myself. So basically as long as i don’t eat 3 meals a day, eat out, breaded food or anything with oil I’ll be okay. If i do eat something fattening I will make sure to do at Least 20 minutes of exercise. Also my doctor is trying to get me therapy and im supposed to go get diagnosed soon at the hospital since my heart rate is low and I’ve lost a lot of weight in the past 3 months or so. I feel like I’m okay tho whenever I look at someone with an ed i think to myself and just tell myself “i just want to loose all this fat but im not trying to end up being like that...im just cutting out every fattening food there is so i can get thinner”. 

I’m so confused and don’t know if what I’m doing is normal or not but i feel like it is and that i don’t have an ed but at the same time deep down i feel like maybe I do. Edit\~ (Theres also times where I’ve ate like a banana or a piece of chocolate but i do it when my mom doesn’t see me but thats really it) and i get anxious whenever i see my family eating out or when i go to a restaurant i get so anxious and scared of giving in. However i no longer feel hungry.

My boyfriend and I essentially decided to up and move across the country woefully unprepared and we failed to realize we had enough money for the apartment, but not for groceries. 

I bring this up because since the month or so that I was hardly eating, I haven't really gotten my previous healthy eating habits back. I usually eat one smallish meal a day, I drink coffee throughout the day at work and I try to eat something like a nature valley bar before I go to work so it's SOMETHING. 

The thing is I'm not hungry during the day and I hardly have hunger cues except for my normal dinner time hunger. Its not that I'm ignoring them exactly, I just really don't get them. I also want to eat more, and eat a more varied diet but nothing really tastes good. I don't feel guilty about eating like I used to, but I don't really understand whats going on. I try not to think too much about what I eat because it does cause me to spiral back into bad habits, but for a while I was tracking everything to make sure I was getting what I needed to be healthy, and I am for sure not eating enough 

My job is also fairly active, and I hate taking breaks because it causes me to lose my momentum and I get really tired. I generally don't feel drained like I used to when I was intentionally restricting, but eating does feel a bit like a chore. I also tend to wonder how my boyfriend can eat as often as he does.

I feel like I should preface all of this by saying that I’ve never seemed professional help, for anything. Ironically (?), I’m too anxious to go to a doctor or therapist. I also have a hard time talking to people I’m close with.

Basically my issue is that I’m not sure if I just have really low self esteem and use food as a way to cope sometimes, or if I’m actually developing/already have an ED. 

I really hate my body the majority of the time. I suck in, I pull on my fat, etc. I’ve stopped going clothes shopping in stores because ever since puberty its been a miserable and genuinely triggering experience. I would stand in the fitting room and punch myself in the stomach until I had to sit down or pass out. 

I eat large amounts of food in private, when bored or need to be distracted, and am ashamed of what I do eat. I never purge or starve myself, but I feel guilty sometimes. I’m vegan (for ethical reasons, not dieting), and really only exercise when I’m feeling optimistic, but that quickly goes again as soon as I feel low.

Up until recently (last 6months?) I really didn’t think I had any sort of ED or was even at risk but now I’m not sure. I took the NEDA screening test and it said I was potentially at risk, but I’m still hoping for a more personal insight.

904,EDPostRequests,1600901063,iyl1qd,"(sorry guys..... i'm really going through it lol...)

Hi friends :)
I'm writing this out of total desperation. I joined reddit a couple minutes ago just so I could get this mess called my life story off of my chest for the first time ever.
So to start, I am female, just turned 18, 5'10"" and 173 lbs. I have been struggling with body image/ eating/ weight since 7th grade, puberty sort of kick-starting it all. I grew to my final height in about a year, which caused me to be hungry CONSTANTLY. I didn't think too much about it because my weight was consistent and I was getting plenty of exercise with school sports. 
Now we go to the beginning of ninth grade; the worst year of my life, the year I almost didn't make it through. 
Lots of changes this year. I had just moved to a new place, I went from a small neighborhood to a secluded farm 40 minutes away from town (which I didn't really mind.) A new school, a highschool  where I know absolutely no-one. A house that required almost 100k worth of renovations. And a bipolar mother who had been 3 months without her medication. And a father with extreme anger issues.
I cried every day for at least an hour. My parents would constantly scream and swear at each other, my father would break things, I was treated as a glorified punching bag for both of them during the heat of it. I should also mention my anxiety, social anxiety, depression and ADHD (only the depression has been diagnosed professionally.)  Who knew renovations could be so terrifying? I think it gave me ptsd, too. I never liked being yelled at as a child, but these days even a loud laugh from someone makes my hair raise and brings tears to my eyes.   
This is when I noticed my eating behaviors. It was always when the house was quiet, like I was terrified a fight would break out any moment. I would eat a lot. Tons. I would stop, get anxious again and then keep eating. Everyday. I think I took to this because it kept my brain and body busy, and the only thing I had to worry about was getting too full. It got much, much worse when highschool actually started. I was too scared to eat my lunch at school (isn't social anxiety the best?) so I would get home and binge for a while, continuing after dinner. Halfway through grade nine, the depression began to creep in. My parents were too busy trying to kill each other to notice I guess, the binging continued. My social anxiety was life threatening at this point. I was scared ALL day, everything made me jump, even walking in the halls. I would shake for the rest of the day after answering a question. I guess all this fear made me more hungry, because I was now binging until the verge of vomiting. I wanted to die. I was going to drown myself in the river at the front of my property, wearing my school bag full of books. One, so it would weigh me down, two, so my parents would know it was school  that pushed me to do it. 
I am holding TONS of probably important details back but I really don't want to be here forever, so I'll speed things up.
Basically, my dog (my best friend) kept me from killing myself, I realized leaving him behind was selfish and I would miss him in hell. I cried more, till I would vomit, my parents finally noticed and took me out of school. I slowed down on my binging and tried using exercise as an escape, and it actually worked. Feeling better now but the other side of depression took its toll on me. I was lazy, grumpy, unmotivated, and emotionless. Halfway through grade 10 and the reno is complete. My parents actually start to patch up their marriage; going to counseling, my mom started new meds and dad tried anger meds.  I am now failing grade 10. I don't want to die but I don't want to live, so I sleep. I go back to school for grade 11 as I have no other choice. Luckily, my depression ironically made me so numb that my social anxiety could not compete anymore. My binging doesn't really occur anymore, I spend most of my time working out. I feel a bit better that summer. My parents are doing ok and I rarely binge, yet I slow down on my exercise and start making tons of desserts and delicious food. I eventually became 185 lbs by the start of grade 12.
Here is where I discovered my current problem; almost no self control around certain foods. It's really strange, when I bake cookies, for example, I end up eating the whole batch of them by the end of the day. For some savory things I do the same,  only if I really like them. I forgot to mention, I have always been late for class, almost everyday, because it is very hard for me to get dressed. I change 1000 times and just end up being angry or crying.  Still happens today. 
Really gonna speed it up now, we're almost there!! 
When quarantine started, I took the opportunity to shed some lbs. I didn't think I could do it, but I ended up getting to my current weight, 173 lbs. I exercised everyday and used an app to count calories. It took about 4 months but I was super proud of myself. I still had no control over ""yummy"" foods though; if I over ate I would stay up until 7am the next morning to starve myself. I could never be successful if dessert was brought into the house or if I went out with friends. I decide to stop my diet  because counting calories everyday was starting to become mentally draining for me.
Now we have reached current day. I have gotten used to the weight I am now and have started acting similar to how I was at 185. I'm starting to hate how I look again. I always say my fat looks very unnatural, and I think how I gained weight influences this. I am not counting calories but watching my portions. I have been doing well until a couple hours ago, when my mother made chocolate chip cookies, I ate 6, a total of 600 hundred calories, meaning I cannot have dinner tonight. Worst part is, I injured my leg the other day and cannot run to burn it off. 
If you have any advice for ""no self control ,"" please, please let me know. I just want to eat normally for once, I want to be able to enjoy something without any regrets or weight gain.

Then becoming too full to finish the meal, but feel bad for wasting my time and money, so I finish it anyways.

Both restaurants I went to that triggered purging afterwards did not offer to go bags, and they were the only meal of my day so far. I am generally good at listening to my body and have no problem saving food for later. If it’s at a restaurant that is cheap, I either take it to go, or leave it uneaten. I’ve even become pretty good at eating to comfortable satiety at buffets.

I don’t have problems binging at all. I do emotionally eat, but always in manageable amounts and I always feel better after emotional eating (never feel like throwing up).

Even if the food is not good, I will still finish all of it. At these times, I eat beyond being comfortably full, and basically feel like throwing up every time I take a step.

Hello. I have been under a lot of stress recently as I believe my partner has an eating disorder. However, as is common, they deny the possibility that there is anything wrong with their eating habits. Although there have been issues in the past, I will first talk about what our situation is at present.

My partner has been making themselves vomit constantly. This occurs about as often as going to the toilet, even when they have not been eating. They have been getting dizzy spells and have frequently fainted for a few seconds. They talk about needing to lose body weight on their arms, thighs, etc.

As is the case with eating disorders, their attitude towards their body is highly critical and, in my opinion, inaccurate. My partner is a healthy weight, leaning towards underweight. However, they believe they’re overweight and that I’m lying to them when I compliment their appearance.

They are paranoid about weight gain, believing that a small, healthy meal will make them gain weight even after purging. They are obsessive about calories and think that very small amounts are too much. My partner even claims to notice a difference in weight immediately after eating.

This is all very concerning and points towards an eating disorder (in my view). I would like to ask people’s opinion on whether or not it is, but I shall also divulge details about previous instances where I have seen evidence of an eating disorder.

The first time was when they threw up after every meal. They wanted to lose some weight on their thighs. After this, when they had more control over their eating, they turned to starving themselves.

For a few weeks, they barely ate at all, skipping meals whenever they could. This resulted in dizzy spells and fainting, which is similar to our current situation. My partner told me they had been looking at harmful pro-ED material. This encouraged them to become dangerously underweight. During panic attacks they would clasp their body parts in despair and stated that they wanted to see their skin against their bones.

At this time period they were underweight and rapidly losing weight; the difference was noticeable to me. However, my partner claimed that there was no weight loss. They were obsessed with wanting to become morbidly underweight, constantly checking the scales and different calories. I worry that this is happening right now.

My heart goes out to the members of this lovely community, God bless you all. I’d love for someone to confirm that what my partner is experiencing is indeed an eating disorder.

I'd like to know if anyone else has experienced these episodes and how they initially got them under control. I'm currently in therapy but I'd like an outside perspective. 

About the ""sleep binges"": I will eat normally,, without restrictions, during the day. Then, at night, I'll wake up in a sort of stupor (I'm not fully conscious during this time), and I'll consume entire chocolate bars, half jars of peanut butter, or anything really calorie- or sugar-dense; I then go back to sleep. I *cannot* stop myself, no matter how many times I've tried. These do seem to happen after particularly stressful days or days riddled with anxiety, but I cant pinpoint any more triggers than that.

The shame and the weight gain is almost too much to bear and I'm really at a loss for what to do.

A little history: I've had an e/d for the past 2,5 years... at least diagnosed. I've struggled a lot with body image before this too but it got really bad after going through a traumatic experience and then bam I developed a full blown e/d. It's been very bad but after recieving treatment it's gotten a lot better even though I can't say that I'm fully recovered yet. 

I wasn't allowed to work out for a long time (except the occasional walks) but since my weight and health is better and I really miss working out I want to get started again. My issue is that I come from an athletic background so I have no idea of how to start a small work out routine. In the past I used to work out 6 days a week, at least 2 hours per day but this was before my e/d. I compulsively worked out when my e/d was bad too but I'd honestly say it was less than when I was younger and competing at an elite level. 

So now I feel very lost because I don't know where to begin. I've always loved being active but I have a tendency to ""go hard or go home"" and I'm super competitive. My body is obviously not what it used to be and I've lost both stamina and muscle from the damage of the e/d. I also love cardio and fast paced things. I tried yoga but that bored the hell out of me. I'm also not sure if I should start running either? It seems like something that would just trigger the calorie counter in me too and I'd end up overexerting myself for a destructive purpose.

first of all, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, please tell me the right subreddit if that's the case.
second of all, I'm sorry for bad english, it's not my first language.

a classmate who's one of my closest friends is struggeling with eating, she told me how many calories she eats and it's really really concerning, she's also lost a lot of weight in a very short time and I'm extremely worried because it doesn't seem like she's going to stop any time soon.
It all started maybe two months ago or even less, at first she told me she couldn't eat much because of all the stress going on in her life (a breakup, fights with family, ...) and I obviously believed her since she was going through a lot. But all of this calmed down a lot and she's still talking about how she's losing weight and how much sports she's doing and all that and by now I'm sure she's doing it on purpose. The way she tracks her calories and all are obviously not on accident.
I am really concerned because her weight was normal at the beginning and she might be underweight now (not sure but definitely borderline)
I know teachers often make things worse, but I really trust the one I am thinking of talking to. (he's a big support to me and helped me with coming out as trans to my class and is overall very sweet and protective of his students)
I would not talk to any other teacher. Her parents also kinda know, but I'm 100% certain they don't know how bad it has gotten (they only know she hasn't been that hungry lately)
I feel like if I tell the teacher I'll betray her because she trusts me with this, but I really don't know what else to do. I can't just go to her parents, they are terrible people and they'd probably just send her to the hospital without any explanation or something like that ughh
I am so worried and I don't know how to support her without supporting that behavior. I myself am mentally ill (DID and MDD) and I've been to a psychiatry before so I'm not completely inexperienced when it comes to this sort of stuff, but I'm still overwhelmed with how to help her. I'm scared that if I don't do anything it will get even worse. She mentioned that she's not even getting her period properly anymore. 
What can I do? One of my friends I met in the psychiatry was servery anorexic and almost died from it and I'm so scared she'll end up that way. I just want her to be happy because she deserves it more than anyone.

For a while I was able to brush off the comments but now reaching 6 months of hearing these comments almost everyday I’m start to break, and quickly. I’m already going back to some of my old habits. I’ve told her that her comments, about foods, dieting, and weight, have hurt me and lead to me to falling into a really bad mental spot with my eating disorder again. She responded with “You can’t blame me, It’s not my fault that you aren’t eating the right things.” I know deep down she is referring to the meal plan I had back at my outpatient program, but it made me feel destroyed. She says I can’t blame her, but it is her fault I’m back here. Just like a big part of me having an eating disorder is from her. I’ve already purged once, and have been getting on the scale every morning. She claims she just forgets that she can’t say those things, but I know it’s just because she wants to tell some one about what she’s doing.

This all started a couple months ago. Growing up I ate junk like crazy but I stayed very thin. as a child I had to drink those protein shakes to gain weight, I didn’t start plumping up until eight grade and my weight evened out my freshman year of highschool. Quarantined happened and I gained a lot of weight. That’s where everything went to shit, I started weighing myself a lot, and eating “healthy” but I either ended up eating to little or too much. I had a big emotional episode and had to go to a psych ward, and I met this girl who called me ‘thick’. I cried in my room but couldn’t stop eating, so I gained more. Right now, I obsess over my food, try to count every calorie, and if I eat anything “unhealthy” or a lot of something I freak out. I love cooking and baking but I feel sick that I can barely eat anything anymore correctly. I ate 2 bowls of soup and 4 hush puppies tonight and the whole time I was wondering if I could throw it up, but I haven’t been successful with that. I just feel like I’m going insane. My family shrugs it off and says It’s not real because I’m not super skinny, now I have this urge to get really sick so someone can help me.

to keep this anonymous, i won't say where he's from, but it's one of those cultures where food is definitely a love language.

i've been struggling with bulimia since i was 15 and able to control what i ate and what i did with it. i was one of those girls that really seemed to just get more weight and curves overnight, and that was awful for me even without my mom's criticism, which inevitably sent me down that path. i was also addicted to working out, which was both something to do to get out of an awful house and something to punish myself.

now i'm at a healthier balance. i'm not perfect, by any means, but one of my things is that i keep track of what i eat. it's not obsessive for me, it's just something i can see at the end of the day and note that this is all the food i've kept down. i push myself every day, but i know when enough is enough.

my boyfriend's mother loves cooking for us, and my boyfriend understands that me eating everything she makes is, right now, out of the question for me. i really do try, you know? it's just that i see the amount of food there and my brain just tells me that i'm disgusting for even considering it and that i deserve the consequence of eating it. usually, it's not even a problem if i'm around the food in my apartment, because i have a lot of control now.

but if i'm at her house, it's just really hard to tell this sweet woman 'no' to almost everything.

she, my boyfriend's dad, and my boyfriend's sister ended up confronting my boyfriend about it, and said that my boyfriend's mom was really hurt because she thinks it means i don't like her food. to my boyfriend's credit, he tried to explain as much as he could without explicitly telling them i'm struggling, because he told me he thinks they'd either ask a lot of questions about it or they would walk on eggshells around me. this really devastated me, as i've never really had a family of my own and these people have been nothing but loving to me, and i really love them as well. i just don't even know what to say. they're from a country where an issue like this isn't necessarily a 'real' issue and is wildly untreated. is there anyone who was in a similar position? i don't even know where to turn now.",Request: my boyfriend's family takes it as an offense that i don't eat much,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/iwbeb9/request_my_boyfriends_family_takes_it_as_an/,1600618658,20-09-20 5:17

In addition to this I am a type 1 diabetic &amp; suffer from HYPOthyroidism (under active).

My big issue is that I struggle with eating &amp; swallowing - most foods I cannot just swallow &amp; will need water to assist. I will gag on most foods that I try to swallow unassisted. The biggest issue seems to be moving the food to the back of my mouth to swallow, and getting it down my throat - there are no specific foods so I’ve sort of ruled out ARFID. I have some body image issues, especially being thin - but im also fit &amp; recognize that so my body image isn’t horrible. I also am now at a point where making food is harder &amp; harder because I am not looking forward to the task of eating.

Hello everyone, I hope that I am in the right subreddit here because I don't know for sure if I actually have an eating disorder, as I don't have a diagnosis nor do I have any issues with body image disturbances. All I know is that I've had trouble eating for most if not all of my life.

What I mean by that is that I can barely eat a healthy amount of food even though I am not scared of gaining weight, quite the opposite in fact, and that the act of eating is giving me trouble every single day.

As a male the average meals other men eat look huge to me and I apparently cannot get used to eating that much, even though I've been trying for years now. Therefore, I've been underweight for most of my life, quite severely during some periods, and even though my weight is healthy now, albeit being on the lower side of things, it is a daily battle to keep it that way and it constantly fluctuates by roughly 10lbs, depending on how well I manage to keep my calory intake intact.

When eating food, even if I enjoy it, my throat basically gives me the signal that I've had enough after only 3 bites and begins to feel tight approximately around the area of the jugular notch (which later extends to the upper areas of the larynx). After about 5 bites more my stomach joins and gives me the sign to stop eating too. Each additional bite after that is a struggle and becomes progressively harder to swallow. It is a bit difficult to explain what it feels like exactly, but I think that ""physical tightening of the throat (even though it probably doesn't actually do that) and a full stomach"" comes close enough.

It really feels like an entirely physical sensation but I don't want to rule out a psychological root or at least component.

Therefore I sometimes can't eat anymore despite still being hungry.

All of this has a rather large negative impact on my life as I can't exercise the way I want to (too little energy, no increase in performance without enough food), can't achieve a balanced diet (no room for vegetables or I won't get enough calories) and the simple fact that eating is such an exhausting activity for me.

I haven't heard of anyone with that kind of problem before and searching the internet usually leads to results of more common types of eating disorders. Has anyone here heard of or, even worse, experienced this before? Do you know how exactly an expert would treat this?

930,EDPostRequests,1601684035,j460ol,"hi! im sory, this turned into a bit of a ramble, (TL,DR at the bottom) 

i'll give a little backstory: around this time last year until about christmas, i'm pretty certain i almost became anorexic. i was restricting quite a lot and became underweight but only just under a healthy weight. i managed to snap myself out of the mentality and go 'back to normal' i guess. i also struggle quite a lot with my body image since then, especially more recently. 

during lockdown i was a healthy weight but gained quite a bit, so i started exercising to get back to how i was before lockdown. then we went on holiday to portugal. i think this really negatively affected me, as i was wearing bikinis all the time and at the beach in front of strangers. my self consciousness went through the roof and since then ive been slowly losing weight, and counting calories, but not restricting to an unhealthy level, although i don't think my mentality and awareness of calories is healthy. 

this week, i went to the gym with my mum (we are very close so i know these comments were only because she cares) and as we were walking out , she was saying that i've been irritable these last few weeks (i hadn't really noticed) and was it because i was trying to lose weight (she knows about what happened last year and that i had lost weight after what i gained in quarantine). recently one of my close family friends became severely anorexic but is now recovering and is back to a healthy weight, but is still waiting for counselling. my mum commented that i've lost a lot of weight, and do we need to get help. i told her everything is fine, 

i do have a goal weight, and it is only just under the healthy weight, and i keep telling myself that i know i will stop when i reach my goal. i know that my goal and mindset is probably not particularly healthy, but i don't want to make anyone worry about me. the reason i am asking on this sub is that i don't want to slip into something like i did last year. 

my question is, do i need to seek help, or am i just being over-dramatic?

TL,DR
i have a lot of body image issues and have set a goal weight which is only just underweight, and my mum is concerned as i have noticeably lost weight (i gained a bit in quarantine, but ive since lost that and a bit more). i don't know whether i should get help or whether i'm being over-dramatic?

I’ve struggled with eating disorders ever since I was little. It never really started until I was eight, when my pediatrician told me, “You’ll be a model, so thin and tall!” He’d say this at every visit thereafter and my mother would be ecstatic, repeating such and constantly reminding me of it. All of my family members would acknowledge my weight and comment as such, even when I was only little. It was the only comment they would make of me, aside from comparing my looks to that of my very masculine father.

Following this increase of comments, not only from my family but even friends and strangers, I had restricted my eating when I wasn’t even ten yet. By the time I was fifteen, I was around the same weight I was at ten, despite growing a handful of inches taller since that point. I was constantly prodded, yet praised, for how I looked despite feeling awful and incomplete. I felt that, although I was at my desired size, I wasn’t happy.

Unfortunately, around the time I was fifteen, a new era of body shapes and sizes had arrived via the media. The new look was fuller and curvier. From this point on I was mocked, called deathly underweight, and that I needed to eat. These comments came from friends at school, family, and even my parents. I felt disgusting and began to binge terribly. I no longer wanted to be thin. In the course of a month, I managed to go from extremely underweight to above a healthy weight, which was a lot for me. I felt nauseous and sick the entire time.

While it was finally a healthy weight for me, I was still ridiculed. My mother noted my weight and said that while I was only slightly above the healthy weight, I needed to lose it. My father joined as well, saying he worried for my health and that I should lose weight. Yet, on the other spectrum, I was mocked at school by both friends and unfriendly acquaintances and called “anorexic” and “disgusting.” I was even told by one of my best friends I had known for years, “I don’t know how your boyfriend is even attracted to you, there’s nothing.”

For the years since then, I have been in a vicious cycle between binging and fasting. My parents, friends, and family mock me and encourage me to worsen myself. No one supports me. I no longer know what to do. I have not felt happy since I was ten, and have struggled mentally since that age.

Hello everyone, I'm here to provide you with my journey on my BED ""treatment"", please feel free to post comments with your advice or review on this

Some context : I have BED mainly associated with stress / boredom and when I start the ""cycle"" it doesn't end after several months.

I've already performed several diets and losing each year for 3 years 30 kilos then gaining them all back, they were all kind of ""hard diet"" with 5/7 days of sport

Now I've been back on the BED and this time is way worse than the other times since even with food in the fridge i will order on deliveroo/ubereats even if it's not diet food in the fridge the urge to order was insane (this was two weeks ago)

Now I'm followed by a therapist about that and I'm mainly focusing on CICO while looking for eating to reach my daily goal instead of trying to optimize it I'm doing the opposite, always trying to reach it so i do carve anything

On the previous diet I liked the fast that I was able to lose 20 kilos in 3 to 4 months but after 3 times that diet it proved to be not-achievable on long term

For now based on my therapist input my goals are as follow :

- Focus on losing the BED habit

- Focus on moving more during the day (Walks, sport, ...) but never overextend

- Weight loss is too early : focus on eating correctly

But unfortunately I'm struggling a lot with the weight loss since I would like to see the results quickly, I'm feeling horrible and ugly because of that and I know that my well-being is vastly dependent on that, and even if I've been free from BED for 14 days and the urge is not there so it's super cool because I'm able to control the BED but I'm still struggling to feel good / look forward and accept that I must leave my body lose weight at a slow pace, to be maintainable over time.

A month or so into my new habits (today lol), my body is just starting to look a bit more healthy and closer to what it once was. As usual, my mom left to go grocery shopping for herself and my dad, but today she came home with a “fun surprise” for me: the same sugar cereals i used to binge.

Hello!

I am really missing this huge part in my recovery and would appreciate any help. I am terrified of my ED coming and staying for myself. And I really want to protect my relationship too. Story below... Please comment some advice.

I am super struggling because for the past year I thought I was recovered. Except, the past two months have been hell and progressively getting worse. For a looong time, I didn't have urges, or thoughts about my restrictive&amp;binge ED/body dysmorphia. Now, I cannot stop. My recovery was found in veganism and intuitive eating. (We are all different paths :) This combo of eating vegan and intuitivly, gave me power and freedom instead of my ED holding the power. My boyfriend recently went vegan as well. I have never had my partner eat the same as me while being recovered. Normally, he ate his foods, keto and I ate mine, vegan. Now, when he eats...it is like I feel the need to monitor his food intake internally to myself. I think, oh thats too much, not enough, not well rounded, just not what I want. If he eats my food, I am scared I wont have enough then end up over eating. When I do not monitor his intake and push back what I feel are ED thoughts, I naturally eat as much as him. This doesn't work for my body because intuitive eating goes out the window. I am gaining weight, which honestly isn't the worst part of it all. The worst part is, I feel I am losing trust in myself to hold the power of food. I don't feel comfortable in my own body because I feel like I am not respecting her.

So, any help yall? I really need some insight. Wishing you all the best. And a huge thank you for this safe space to share.","Request: I thought I was recovered, but struggling.

My fiancé and I have been together for over 3 years and plan to get married in December. Since the beginning, I was aware that she struggled on and off with restricting and it has been something she has sought treatment for in the past. I’d say it’s mild, and during the beginning of quarantine she was doing great and got to a healthy weight. I made it a point to compliment her body during this time as her 0 size clothes started not fitting, but she seemed pleased with her progress overall. 

I’ve noticed that she has recently relapsed and is restricting more and more. It kills me and I know it’s wearing on her but it has never been something she is super open about - she just says it matter of factly that she struggles.

My girlfriend has been battling her eating disorder for years and she seems to have gained more control over it. However, every once in a while she will ask me if she’s gained weight or if I think she looks fat or chubby I tell her I haven’t noticed, which is the case (I learned quite quickly that responding with “you look beautiful” is not the answer)

My fear is that by me saying “I haven’t noticed” does that translate into her mind that she’s always looked this “chubby”? I tell her that I wish she could see herself through my eyes but, as I’m sure is with most/all cases, once she has an image in her mind, it’s not going away.

Hi friends,

I want to share a bit of my story and I hope it will give you some hope. I developed my ED at 10 years old. I’ll spare you the details but it was a long, horrific and often unbearable 17 years that I suffered from my eating disorders. I did not receive treatment until I was in my 20s and once I started treatment it became an even more horrific fight for my life.

Eating disorders are no joke. They are dangerous, serious and deadly. I am saying this because I care about your life, your well being and your quality of life. Eating disorders suck everything out of you... I am not talking physically as we all know ED’s come in every shape and size - I am talking they take away your personality, friends, family, interests. They completely wreck your life and do so unapologetically.

After years of treatment I can proudly say I am recovered from my eating disorders. And I know you can too. If you need support, I’m here. If you need encouragement, I’m here. My hope for you is that you’ll find someone safe and reach out to them for help. It takes a village. It takes help. AND it is 100% ACHIEVABLE.

Most days I will go out and spend twenty to thirty dollars on meals that will end up going down the toilet thirty minutes later. I cannot stop. When I eat, it feels euphoric. I dont just throw up so I don’t gain weight, I throw up so I can get the feeling of being sick out of myself. My stomach is so filled with food I can barely walk.

I have suffered from different eating disorders throughout my life. I have swung between anorexia and binge eating disorder. Recently my binge eating disorder got severely out of control. My doctor put me on an FDA approved medication to treat it but that comes with appetite suppression. I don’t mind it but I’m not hungry during the day at all. I can go an entire day without eating. The last time I was on a medication that suppressed my appetite it triggered my anorexia. I lost a lot of weight, but I was starving myself, excessively working out, challenging myself to eat less and less calories than the day before until I wouldn’t eat for weeks. I don’t want this to happen again. How can I continue my BED treatment but prevent triggering my anorexia? I am currently working out once or twice a week. But eating has been a challenge because I’m not hungry. I try to only step on the scale 2-3 times a week, but it’s a struggle to not get on it everyday in fear I gained weight.

Hi all -

As part of my partner’s journey to sustained sobriety, he has wanted to focus on his diet, specifically eating a keto diet without formally calling it that. At first, I had clashed with him quite a bit because, to me, it felt incredibly triggering because it was disordered eating. To this day, he insists that the aim is to not ~lose weight~ even though at other times he said he’s almost at his “goal weight.” He claims he makes these food swaps because it makes his stomach less upset, however, I know the goal and continued reasoning is weight loss. 

We had a discussion a few months ago and he shared how much it upset him that I would get on his back about his meals. My comments were usually around him missing food groups and he would counter me saying technically they were still there (I am being vague because I don’t know if it would be upsetting/breaking rules if I specify further). I explained why I would make comments and how 1. it triggers me and 2. i’m so worried about him w/ disordered eating and it potentially spiraling. He has expressed that his body is different than mine and he doesn’t have an ED. When I see him preparing a meal, I feel sick and don’t want to eat myself. I end up crying in the corner. It has really upset me. 

So…I’m here, feeling lost. I have tried to overlook his meals but we live together in a small apartment and it’s in my face. I find myself especially struggling with reframing thought about comparing my meals with his because I’m in a larger body and both medical professionals and society have taught me that my weight and body are not adequate (despite my blood labs and medical documents showing that my levels are healthy).

I‘ve always had a difficult relationship with food, my body, my weight, both objectively and myself in relation to other people. I’m an emotional eater for sure, and growing up there was a lot of “good” and “bad” and guilt thrown around about food. As early as preschool, I remember feeling fat compared to my peers. I would sneak and hide food and eventually began to secretly binge eat. As I got older and more independent, it was easier, and it has escalated. It’s caused me to put on weight, much to my mother’s chagrin, and I’ve yo-yo dieted for the past 5 years but never been able to get down to the healthy weight I was at 16. During these diets, I’ve always taken them far (not as extreme as in, like, not eating anything, but as in very restrictive and regimented, causing me to obsess and weigh myself several times a day). This then caused more anxiety about food, especially if I was going out of town (one summer, when I was religiously doing intermittent fasting, I flew to see a friend but eating breakfast with her that week seriously frightened me) or even out to a restaurant with friends. And after losing some weight in the summer, every fall I would go back to school and relapse into the binge eating, which I think is a poor coping mechanism to handle stress and emotions, and would gain the weight back and then some.

I think I just barely meet the DSM-V criteria for BED, but because it’s kind of on the threshold and I haven’t been diagnosed by a professional I’m not sure. I also exhibit other behaviors like body checking (like sometimes I’ll try on a ton of clothes in my closet at least once a month-it’s fun because I love fashion, but it’s excessive-I want to see that things fit and even if I’m super tired and want to sleep, I keep going and will stay up an extra hour or more) and food anxiety (I can’t eat certain foods or amounts around others unless it’s a social thing or someone else is doing it too because I would feel too embarrassed).

This summer, some personal stuff happened that triggered my biggest binges ever. I’ve always been scared of throwing up so I was never able to purge, but I started seriously wanting to and tried to-thankfully I couldn’t. I finally realized that maybe something was wrong. I told my family in August and am currently seeking help but won’t be able to get fully established with a therapist for another few weeks. I am tired of waiting and I really want answers.

973,EDPostRequests,1602116740,j72uyc,"I recently moved together with my boyfriend and of course we have to adapt our eating habits to fit into the realationship. I used to go through a phase of restricting and overexcercising a lot, though found somewhat of a semibalance and now i eat regualry and would say my calorie in/output is ok. Slightly underweight but i‘m not enforcing it.

Despite this, i have noticed that every time we have dinner together (my biggest meal of the day and the only one we share) i get insaasaneeely aggressive towards everything. It stops the moment i am done eating and starts when i start prepping the food.
Of course i barely let him do anything, maybe cut some stuff but i have found myself yelling at him for cutting carrots the wrong way and calling him all the words i know for using too much olive oil. I am quite embarrassed by my behavior, but i cannot keep calm and just take deep breaths. 

I have no idea on how i can get in control of that and what triggers me so much, even though i do all the cooking myself and am genuinely liking it. Needless to say, when something goes other than i wished, i lose my mind and start yelling and getting quite insulting (not only to food relating things). 
He knows i am difficult with food sometimes and usually leaves me alone.
Also, i get food-competitive like no ones business. If he eats something that is „mine“ i snap at him. i‘m kinda always scared i‘m running out of food for no sane reason (?).


This is about to destroy a good amound of our realationship.

974,EDPostRequests,1602116730,j72uvq,"First of all I want to clarify that I have never been diagnosed with an eating disorder and do not claim to have one. I have been diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder, but I’m wondering if there might be a little bit more at play than just that. I’m posting my experience here hoping to find out if people recognise this and to hopefully get some tips. 

Weight has been an issue as long as I can remember. I was never skinny enough, but I also never had the ‘mental strength’ to properly diet.  I specifically being friends with a skinny girl in primary school and asking her what her diet was like (only to not be able to follow it because I ate more lol). 

I’m 22 now and I’m struggling. I do not see my body the way that other people do. When I show my mom a picture of someone I think has a body alike to mine she’s like: “uhh, no sweetie”. I also find that when I find someone ‘goals’ they tend to be too skinny to other people. You could say that my BDD is very weight focused. When we talk about food I feel like it gets a bit tricky because it doesn’t necessarily fit into the stereotypical eating disorder descriptions. There are weeks that I eat very little and perhaps feel good about that. However, this instantly causes me to be unable to go to the toilet properly and cause bloating, which then makes me feel like I’ve gained weight. I don’t count calories, but I’m very aware of my choices. It’s always “I can eat this or this.. this has less calories.” But during certain periods of time I can also just.. be like whatever and grab whatever. Like lat week I’ve eaten calorie rich sweets in two different occasions; but I consider it to be a bad thing. That comes along with thoughts such as: ‘like this you’re never going to lose weight’. 

I also no longer get on the scale because I fear I’ve gained weight. I’m constantly asking for reassurance, but also not really believing what other people are saying. My sister went; ‘do you think i’m skinny?” just now and I asked the question in return. She said: “Average” and my mood has been down ever since. I instantly regretted the fries I’d eaten just before that and my first thought was to exercise upstairs.

I’m kinda unsure what to do. Waiting lists for therapy are long here, but thankfully I have it available for me as an option. However, most places are ‘a bit of everything’. So for example; they do know some things about BDD but they most likely don’t have enough experience to proper treat it. Would it be smarter for me to start looking at a place where they treat eating disorders because perceiving your body bigger as it is appears to be something a lot of people with eating disorders struggle with? They would probably know how to help me better than the places working as mentioned above. I've been to those before and it definitely didn't help me.

I have had a point where I didn't eat, at all. And I lost an unhealthy amount of weight in 4-5 months last year because of that.

I first didn't feel like eating, then I got a period where I got obsessed over calories and not eating more than a quarter of what you should eat a day. Lost an unhealthy amount of weight, found a coping mechanism that isn't healthy either but I am not gonna talk about that. Started eating something again, but still afraid of calories and restricting food, I eat but if I gain weight I stop eating for a few days until my weight is back or even lower. Now I can eat, but I feel the urge to puke/to make myself puke whenever I eat something and I still am very focused on calories and what I am eating on a day (but less precise than before, now I could say I ate between a certain amount of calories while before I could give the exact number).. Also, I can overreact when I eat to much for my standard, and this usually ends in unhealthy coping mechanisms if you know what I mean.

And honestly purging is easier than restricting for me even though I know how bad it is for me.

It wasn't hard to resist the urge to purge initially since I wasn't eating well and kept forgetting to eat. Now I feel like I'm hungry frequently and I actually do love cooking and eating. And I eat pretty healthy. I just have a shitty metabolism.

And when is a little weight gained going to become a lot if it already happened this quickly? This is the most I've weighed in a long time. I mean only by a little from what I weighed at the beginning of February but the fact that it's more is enough to get me worked up. Especially since it came on that fast.

And I've never been like a super skinny person. I'd say I'm like average but I'm small. I don't think I'm unattractive necessarily but at the same time I hate my body. It's more like I'm aware that other people don't find me unattractive even though I think I need to be skinnier.

978,EDPostRequests,1602074607,j6q4bc,"So I hot diagnosed with anorexia about a month ago. I had it for longer but I was never diagnosed because my past doctor never seemed to care.  I would faint while getting blood work done and they knew I never ate and didn’t seem to worry or care. I ended up moving to a clinic closer and  I found the most sweetest doctor ever. Ever since the first time we met she was the sweetest and always made sure to listen to me. She knew I struggled with anorexia and she convinced my mom I needed the help when my mom just thought it was something stupid. She spent the whole past week trying her best to get in contact with many hospitals and the ED specialists, even if they wouldn’t answer her she tried her best until finally she got me an appointment for this upcoming Thursday for a therapist for the meantime while she receives a call from other specialists. She always understood and tried her best to help me in every way she could. I always felt heard and she made me realize that maybe I did needed help and well she was the first one to get me help it all started with her. 

Today tho...I went to the clinic for my weekly check up and well she told me that in 2 weeks she is going to be leaving to another different clinic where she got a job. It broke me right away because she was the only one who always cared . I really wanted to cry but me trying to act tough i didn’t. It hurts to know that next week will be the last time I see her. She meant so much to me and she was the only doctor ever to make me feel like I was valued and my health was important. I’m so thankful for everything she did for me. Really I am. I wish she knew how much she meant for me and it sucks to know that next week will probably be the last time I ever see her again. I feel so sad, I never binge but I have this urge to just binge because i feel so sad and worried and im gonna miss her. Ig I’m worried that I’ll never have someone who cared so much and who took me seriously just like her even if I wasn’t underweight or at a serious point. Idk if I should binge because I never have and i know I’ll feel like shit and guilty and even more depressed later if I do binge but part of me just wants to let it take control and just eat my pain away. Idk what to do. Part of me wants to just write her a letter and give it to her the last time I see her which is next week. I want to tell her that I’m thankful for her.

This led to me not eating breakfast at all before noon for the next seven years of my life after I finally put my foot down and refused to eat breakfast so early. I was just never hungry on my own for at least two hours after I woke up. But I noticed a very weird issue now: if I get up after 9 AM, I’m not hungry before 1 PM, I might feel slightly peckish (“Hm, this looks good I guess”), but nothing that wouldn’t go away when I bury myself into a book or something, it’s a level of hunger that is so low I forget about if the doorbell rings. 
If I wake up before 9 AM, I have terrible hunger pains (7/10 pain scale) and I am simultaneously very hungry and very nauseous, so I don’t eat anything anyway. The only remedy so far is to just sleep through it, because it doesn’t wake me up at all. As you may imagine this poses some problems if my current job requires me to be in the office at 8 AM or something like that.

I've been dealing with atypical anorexia and compulsive overeating on and off for a few years now. Recently I've been meeting remotely with a dietician to try to keep myself on track to recovery during the pandemic. It's been going fairly well.

Today I took one of my cats to the vet and asked them about his size since he's been looking a little overweight compared to his brother. I've been raising him and his brother from kittenhood and they're finally getting to the age where we have to start worrying about overfeeding. The vet said he was in fact starting to get too heavy for his frame and recommended that we switch from letting the cats graze on dry food all day to having portioned, scheduled feeding.

As a lifelong obsessive cat lover and someone aspiring to a career in vet medicine, I understand full well that being overweight as a cat is far more unhealthy and dangerous than being ""overweight"" as a human. Our anatomies are not the same; we have different dietary needs. I trust that if our vet says my cat should go on a diet, then it is necessary to preserve his health, comfort, and happiness. And I am determined to do right by my cats.

This isn't a question of if I should restrict my pets' food intake, as I've already said I understand and trust our vet's professional opinion; it's a question of how I can cope with the feelings this stirs in me as a recovering eating disordered person.

I have to count calories for my cats. I may have to buy a scale to monitor their weight. And I have to push through denying them food when they're vocalizing that they're hungry because they've gotten used to being able to eat whenever.

All of this is of course very distressing and puts me at risk of relapse.

Does anyone out there have any advice for me to get through this?

Now about my family: my brother and my mom are rather bulky and my dad has a normal body, albeit with some fat on him. It was my mom and my brother who liked to eat a lot. They just loved food. That isnt to say they were overly fat or anything. But a few years ago, my mom had a stroke, mostly due to her having high blood pressure (she always did love fatty food). Thankfully my brother hasn't had one. But ever since my mom had her stroke, I guess it made me rather hesitant on gaining more weight than I'm used to.

I do love to eat, but only a small portion of it. Recently though, I experienced passing a small gallstone.

Now, i'm on (online) classes again and both of my parents are working, so we don't have time for going for the groceries or cooking, they keep ordering delivery food or buying “comida corrida”, and since we are mexican lots of this foods include a lot of bread, tortilla, grease, strong flavors etc, and i'm never able to finish them, i cant handle a lot of , smells or textures now and i can hardly eat my food, i avoid eating in front of my family and eating in general, i don’t have enough meals and feel grossed out really easily, a lot of guilty feelings every time i eat, i also body check like, every time i pass in front of a mirror, follow lots of skinny girls on tiktok to make me feel worse on purpose and over-exercise 5 days a week, even when i don't have energy.

i have always struggled with my body, going through phases of binge/purge and complete starvation, but none lasting this long. i’ve always been overweight, so i quickly began receiving compliments over my weight loss. i lost the amount of weight one would normally lose in 2 months in one week, and was congratulated. the past couple of days i have been, somewhat shamefully, bingeing. today, i even ate 2 full meals with a bag of chips ! i didn’t even count calories, though the thought was prevalent in my mind.
i’ve been feeling good, but the number on the scale keeps going back up. i decided to search for motivation to continue this - i won’t even call it a diet - starvation, and came across the netflix movie, to the bone. at first, i was bothered by the protagonist; then, by there even being a love interest in such a sensitive story. however, it eventually started to make me feel,,,, i don’t know, sick i suppose?
the miscarriage scene hit hard, eli staring down on her decaying, naked body after the very emotional scene with her mother hit even harder. i don’t know. i guess was expecting this to be a misinformed and messy production, like 13rw. something enough to trigger me back into starving myself. but, if anything, it’s made me afraid of this rapid weight loss. i don’t want to be overweight again. i don’t want to hear people telling me how well i was doing before i gave up. i don’t want to lose this method of control. but, this movie alone has really terrified me.
i don’t know what to do now. it’s 4:00 am, and i feel a bit too sick to sleep. i don’t know what to do from here. do i go back to starving myself and forget what i saw, heard, and processed? or do i try to ask for help? another worry that i have is that nobody will take it seriously if i do. i’m still heavy, granted much less than months prior. i’m even nearing a healthy weight. but what if i’m just given more congratulations by a doctor? i’ve been diagnosed with a multitude of mental illnesses, and body dysmorphia was amongst them. i am afraid, though.

Hello All!

I'm just a few weeks into a long-delayed recovery. I have found that much of my pull towards ED is the need for feelings of power and control of self and situations, and a perception that restriction is strength. I want to rework my internal definitions of those words, to decrease the hold they have over me within the context of ED. I've got a few things started but I'm a little stuck. \*\* What does power mean to me? The ability to affect change, being knowledgeable, being able to enforce boundaries

What does strong mean to me? Physical endurance, mental/emotional strength, discipline, commitment, having a sense of agency

What does control mean? Enforcing boundaries again, ??

I (female) am at my first year at uni and I have struggled with my self esteem for a long time regarding my weight, but I feel like it’s gotten so much worse lately. I have counted calories since sophomore year of high school and lost a little bit of weight (needed, trust me) and even though I purged once in awhile I consider it a healthy weight loss.

Now, however, I’ve begun to feel really guilty about eating. I started out just being strict about not going over my calorie limit, which made me feel good, but it’s escalating. For the last week or so I’ve eaten much less than the calorie counter app allows, and I’ve begun jogging as well. I’ve noticed that my pants are a little looser now, but I don’t have a scale in my flat so I can’t determine how much weight I would’ve actually lost? I limit my purging to like three times a week because I don’t want to mess up my throat, and I don’t binge, so it’s definitely not bulimia?

Basically I restrict caloric intake, purge infrequently, and I chew/spit ALL the time when I’m feeling snacky. But idk if it even really counts as an ED because I’m not underweight and I’ve not talked to anyone about it? I think I’m losing weight but without the scale I can’t determine how much. I am a perfectly healthy weight, slender even, but I still can’t seem to shake the guilt of eating and the desire to lose weight.

Hi everyone, I never ever struggled with eating and body dysmorphia until last year. I’ve always been what people might consider “skinny” a had “good” body. I used to be really athletic when I was younger, I danced competitively until I was 18, which I guess all of this was keeping me in shape. I was really happy with it. 
About two years ago I was diagnosed with major depression, anxiety. Because of this I went on a bunch of medication, The antidepressants initially made me lose weight and I was now quite visibly skinny. Later it was suspected I also had Bipolar disorder so I went on mood stabilisers and these tend to cause weight gain as a side effect. I gained 14kgs in the span of 2-3 months which to me was absolutely outrageous and excessive, I took me almost 2 years to get back to lose 7kgs and I still have a couple of kgs to go back to my original weight (before pills). Losing and gaining weight made notice my body more often, always scared of how my weight would be changing. 
Right now, being roughly 7kgs above my usual weight, I feel horrible. Not like myself at all. I hate how clothes fit, how I look in the mirror. I became obsessed with exercising, calorie counting. I fast for 16 hours a day and barely eat when I’m supposed to. I skip meals, and only eat as a reward for exercising or fasting for long periods of time otherwise I feel like I don’t deserve it. I enjoy food soo so much and I feel like I have to keep myself from it. I pinch my body and cry because I don’t look how I’m supposed to, how I always looked. 
I already suffer of the mental disorders described previously so I don’t want to go to my psyc and say I feel like I also might have this. I feel like psychiatrists think that if you think you have it, you probably don’t, you’re faking it. 
This is absorbing me. All I think of every day. I don’t know what to do or how to help myself.

Since the pandemic started I had issues getting food. First it was financially then logistically. I finally get food delivered.

But I've had these issues before. And not they are rearing their ugly head and I don't know what to do.

Basically I'm afraid of getting sick. In the past I suffered through bouts of food poisoning and a gastrointestinal problem that lasted about 6 years of intense pain and vomiting after eating.

This year because the pandemic happened I can't do the things I would normally do to keep this phobia from getting out of control. I liked to eat meals with friends or go to restaurants especially buffet restaurants where everyone is eating the same food and I feel more confident and comfortable. Or I lived with partners who would cook and I watch them eat and we eat together.

This year I've had a few issues where I got badly sick on canned food and some refrigerated processed meats. But now because I can't do the shopping for myself, it's getting unbearable.

I buy frozen food. the vegetables have tiny pinprick holes in every bag. I buy meals they are full of freezerburn like they were thawed and refrozen. Seals look opened and resealed. Canned goods I'm terrified of botulism. I read too much about it when I was sick and now I'm scared. Raw food always gets recalled for ecoli salmonella etc I've bought raw chicken that smells like ammonia when I open the container, ground beef that is super bright red on the outside and dark brown on the inside. My OCD about it is getting worse and worse

I'm basically surviving on dairy gains and protein bars and vitamins

I want to eat. I really do. But I can't go to the store because I have pre-existing condition that makes me high risk for covid. So I'm at the mercy of shopping online and just getting whatever is delivered wasting money and still not eating.

I've lost half my body weight and since I was obese before online ""friend"" thinks it's a good thing I'm not eating and doesn't care how much pain and anguish I'm going through. If I talk to my family I get yelled at. What can I do to safely eat veg fruit and meat before I get a deficiency or end up in the hospital?

What can I do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Request: Eating disorder/OCD triggers,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/jaadh2/request_eating_disorderocd_triggers/,1602604776,13-10-20 4:59

I’m 25 F, It started when I was about 21 I think. I had a traumatic event that happened to me and sent me into a really bad depressive episode. I couldn’t eat anything really, and I lost a lot of weight in a short amount of time.

I just brushed it off, and tell them I was eating less. Now, i’m at a healthy weight, but nowhere near where I was when I was over weight. Ever since then, I’ll have moments where I can’t eat.

I (30F) used to have a terrible relationship with food. I was always in great shape in high school but, I never felt good enough. I turned to binging and laxatives. I also exercised constantly.

Then, I started my first semester of college. I continued binging but, due to shared dorm bathrooms I couldn’t bring myself to take laxatives or purge. I ended up gaining weight that semester, and by the time I got back to school I was willing to do whatever it took to lose it.

This is when I settled into full on bulimia and started planning my binges around my roommates class schedule. I would weigh myself before each binge, eat until I felt sick, and throw up into a trash bag until I weighed within a pound of where I started. After I took out the “trash”, I’d go to the gym and run 6 miles - this happened every day, and it lasted all semester.

When I got home for the summer, I guess I was just tired. My entire life revolved around my ED and it was exhausting. On top of that, I was so scared I’d be found out that I just stopped. I thought that was the end of it. I was triggered many times over the next few years and would go through short phases of binging and purging but, it never lasted. My weight yo-yoed for a long time, but eventually it stabilized and I’ve stayed around that weight for 6 years, ED free.

This is the first time I’ve shared my story with anyone, but it’s long overdue. I recently realized I’ve been harboring a massive amount of shame and guilt for never telling anyone. I beat my ED all by myself, but it was incredibly taxing and painfully lonely.

I wanted to share my story to remind you that you shouldn’t have to struggle alone. When you’re ready, ask for help.

I recognised that what I was doing was unhealthy yet I couldn’t stop. I was obsessed with purging and then weighing myself afterwards. It brought me joy but it never ever truly satisfied me, if that makes sense?
I’ve been to a psychologist but psychologists can’t actually make diagnosis’s, only a psychiatrist can. I don’t know what the hell I would even call this issue that I had, but I know it was really serious up til the point it was consuming my life. And I would still look at myself as fat.

I booked a visit with a therapist and now I'm afraid I'm just wasting her time.

In my country the person that diagnoses you, gives meds, etc. is the psychiatrist. So a week ago I finally booked a visit, and now I'm having huge doubts. I don't starve myself all the time. I don't purge and vomit all the time. I weight within healthy range. In fact right now I'm in sort-of a good streak. I'm counting calories and sort-of sticking with the plan. But there were times when I was starving myself, there are times when I'm purging. I love the feeling of an empty stomach, there's a chance never weight enough to feel satisfied, I always look at what everyone else around me is eating and trying to eat less. I feel like a disgusting blob, I compare myself to everyone. And I don't remember the last time I wasn't trying to or thinking about trying to loose weight. But I'm so scared that all of this is just simply lack of strong will or me being overdramatic. I don't want to waist anyone's time and I'm afraid of hearing that I'm just making up my problems",Request: I booked a visit with a therapist and now I'm afraid I'm just wasting her time.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/jemesi/request_i_booked_a_visit_with_a_therapist_and_now/,1603209239,20-10-20 4:53

Hello everyone.  I am still relatively new here but I have been struggling recently with disordered eating and anorexia.  I also sometimes have bingeing episodes.  I am sixteen and male and I believe I may be anorexic.  I do not have an official diagnosis and I have never been evaluated for an eating disorder before.  I realize posting specific information regarding calories or weights is prohibited here.

I have been fasting and restricting my calories.  I have also been misusing laxatives.  I use fasting and laxatives to try to compensate for the binges when they do happen.  I am trying to stop the laxative abuse because I realize abusing laxatives is dangerous and can cause digestive problems.  

I have been fasting for the past two days.  I am scared to start eating again because I believe I need to continue fasting.  I have been losing weight constantly for more than six months.

1042,EDPostRequests,1603100603,jdyp3e,"Years ago when I was around 13/14 I know I was a bit messed up with food and in general. I remember throwing my dinner away outside. Doing diet's like the ABC diet. I remember one day my calorie limit was 30calories which was difficult to manage. Etc. 

After that I got better and I think I have been eating pretty normal for the most part. 

But I went through a phase where I would only eat fruit and veg.

About three years ago I definitely started over exercising, (2/3 times a day, doing about an hour of cardio) and not supplementing what I was eating properly. I would do intermittent fasting so I would go to the gym early morning and start eating at about 1pm during the day.

Then I would go back to eating normally but limit what foods I can eat. Eg. no bread/pasta.

And now more recently I've started fasting for about three days, then eating normally, and repeating. 

And when I say eating normally I mean just one meal a day.

I'm not too thin or too big for my height, I'm just about right.

I just feel like it is on my mind a lot and like I cant say things to people because they will think its wrong - so that makes me think maybe it is. But then I have seen some people do fast for a few days for like health reasons and I just dont know is it okay to do or not.

Hi I don’t know where else to go to post this. My GF is recovered from anorexia during highschool. I started dating her this past January and she has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. I know she is the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. I am currently deployed however... she didn’t tell me about her eating disorder and what she recovered from until right before I left. She said I was a big factor in her not having a relapse and that she was scared to what would happen when I was gone.

Well 4 months later and she has started restricting again. She lied the other day about what she ate and told me she lied. I’m not mad at all... I’m worried fucking sick. I have been doing a lot of research about it and I have found that restricting can be a form of control. She tells me it feels good to do it... it hurts to hear her say that. I know she doesn’t want to worry or hurt me with it. When it’s really bad she tries to push me away and make me not care about her. That is never going to happen. I love her way too much. She is tired of fighting it. I don’t understand exactly what is going on in her head, but I try and understand the best I can so I can help.

I just got off the phone with her and she sees that she can win in two ways

1. She lets it take control and eventually she won’t have to deal with it anymore(that fucking hurt bad)
2. I did tons of research of therapists taking in clients with eating disorders and got number she can call to make and an appointment on Monday(she promises she will call them) so she can call and get help and try and best this

I’m no doctor, I don’t have an eating disorder but I tell her everyday that it doesn’t make her any less of a person, doesn’t make me love her any less. That I am always here for her. She won’t push me away. I think I am the only person she is still holding on for. I know the cognitive dissonance in her head is bad because she doesn’t want to hurt me or lose me but she doesn’t want to deal with the pain anymore either. I got her to get up and make a shake on our call but I can tell that was a struggle too.

I guess I’m making this post because I don’t know what else I can do right now. I want to hold her and tell I love her but I can’t because I’m stuck in the middle of butt fuck Afghanistan. I’m just worried. I don’t want to wait for two more days for her to get any help because I know the longer she restricts the easier it will be to keep going. I don’t want to call 911 or mental services or whatever I would call to get her admitted somewhere but I’m at my wits end. I’m scared for her. I love her and I want her to be okay...

So I have been feeling super uncomfortable about my weight recently. My mother has always put pressure on me to lose weight, even tough I'm a healthy weight. She keeps saying how her waist was thinner at my age, how she was lighter, etc. She also says that I was thinner as a child, and I shouldn't look like this. Because of this, I have a really unhealthy body image. I like my body most of the time, I'm just always told that it's disgusting for others. I've been pressure to lose weight, even in unhealthy ways. I've been told to eat less than x calories a day (very low amount). At this point, because of quarantine limiting my interactions, that's all I hear. It's been wearing down my self esteem. I feel nauseous after eating, and I think about purging to lose weight. I know its wrong and unhealthy, I just want to be good enough. Maybe then my mother will leave me alone. Also, if anyone can recommend healthy ways to lose weight, I'd be happy to hear.

I've had an eating disorder for years where I want to eat but as soon as I try to eat, or put anything in my mouth, I feel sick to my stomach and have to spit it out. I also throw up very often. This has interfered with me eating in public, in places I'm not familiar with, or around people I'm not comfortable with. The thing is tho, I have a positive body image and I don't want to lose weight whatsoever. I can even pinpoint when it started. When I was in high school I loved food. I'd always get a hot dog from the canteen at lunchtimes because it was my favourite thing to get. One day, I took a bite and felt immediately sick. I thought it was weird, but I didn't worry about it. However, I started worrying when it continued into the next day, and the day after etc. I ended up getting so underweight I needed to go into emergency. I've had all the tests done and it's nothing physical. No doctor believes me when I tell them I don't want to lose weight and I want to eat. My psychologist will pretend to believe me, then ask my mum if she knows if Ive been exhibiting ""anorexic behaviour"". I just don't know where else to turn.

1049,EDPostRequests,1603016533,jddzj1,"So, I've been dealing with an eating disorder(s) for a very long time. About 13 years. Mostly restricting with infrequent periods of binging and purging, although I stopped purging for good a few years ago. 

Up from the end of high school until now, I was able to maintain a relatively good weight despite still internally struggling - slim but healthy BMI.

Well, I've reached a problem. A combination of actually taking my ADHD meds and it probably increasing my metabolism, and not thinking about eating because of stress - and dare I say it - withholding food as a motivator to do work - has placed me as underweight (not extremely though, but the loss has been relatively rapid) for the first time in many years. I'm starting to swim in clothes that have never been big on me. I haven't been this constipated since I was in middle school. I typically try to track my macros with LifeSum, because it's cute and motivational and tells me that I'm doing a good job when I eat. Unfortunately, this isn't enough. Often times I'll ignore using the app altogether, and then go about the bad habit of counting calories in my head instead, which can send me into a restricting rabbit hole. 

I try to remind myself to eat at least the regular 3 meals a day, and keep things like fruit and bars around the house as snacks. But... I think seeing the number on the scale has only encouraged me to eat less and less.

TL;DR: Is there a way I can snap out of this miniature spiral and find a way to remind myself that self-care is important?

This may sound weird but here we go.
I knew i was going down the deep end for a while, I was still at a healthy weight but I realized my mindset was all wrong. How I bullied myself for eating certain stuff, restricted myself, pushed myself for way more activity than i needed. I knew something was off but with Corona getting help was hard.
Multiple times I had seen doctors for fainting during work (i have a very labour intensive job) the general advice stayed the same ""stop losing weight, eat more"" and everytime i'd say ""gotcha"" and everytime by the next doctor visit I had lost more weight.
I finally got to see a psychiatrist at a hospital who specialises in eating disorders. She didn't beat around the bush about it. I have an ED and I needed to agree on a few things with her but was allowed to go home.
I've tried doing everything she said, cut out some of the behaviours we agreed on, but it tears me apart, i sometimes just cry not being able to do a certain behaviour and not doing one thing drives me into doing another probably equally negative thing.
It has come to the point i'm underweight, and I hate it, I hate what this is doing to me, I hate what this is doing to the people I love. I hate being this exhausted 24/7 both physically and mentally. I'm just so tired I just wanna sleep...
Part of me is wondering if I should ask to get taken into inpatient treatment. 
But then I'd probably have to break the news to my dad (my parents are seperated, my mom is painfully aware of my problem) but my dad doesn't know yet and I'd rather he doesn't know.

I decided to use my extra free time to start counting calories obsessively, working out, etc. and dropped to an unhealthy number on the scale and still thought I needed to lose more.

Suffice it to say, that was not sustainable and while I’ve refused to step on the scales for weeks now (I don’t think I could handle it) I know I’ve reached my starting weight, if not more.

1067,EDPostRequests,1603791455,jiy245,"Over the last few years, I’ve noticed that my 60 yo mom has slowly stopped eating. Her doctor repeatedly tells her that she needs to gain weight, and her response is that she eats all the time. But she doesn’t!

When she visits, she will request elaborate meals (think: go to Costco at 6pm to buy lobster and steak) that she will have me prepare, take literally two small bites, and trash the rest.

If I ask her why she’s not eating, she says that her stomach hurts. Then she comments on how much I eat and how I could manage to lose a few pounds, which I do NOT appreciate. I’m of average weight for my height.

The last time she came over, I noticed meat and cheese was missing from my fridge after she left. She definitely didn’t eat it during the visit, meaning she snuck it out in her bag. I think it’s pretty strange behavior, not to mention very bad manners. (She has more than enough money to buy her own food).

The weird meal requests, stealing my food, and rude comments about my weight are highly annoying. But now, I wonder if these behaviors are symptoms for a larger issue?

Physically my mom is deteriorating. Her skin is sagging and her hair is falling out, presumably due to the weight loss. She’s noticeably underweight.

When I’ve tried voicing my concern about her health, she snaps at me for being mean to her and says all anyone ever does is pick on her. And then she cries until I admit I’m the root cause of the problem and then life goes on. 

Years ago, I told my mom that she seemed really unhappy, and maybe therapy would be worth looking into. She’s screamed, cried, and then refused to speak to me for 8 weeks. My dad also refused to speak to me in solidarity.

My dad says she eats all the time and there isn’t any problem. They have a strained relationship.

My sister agrees with me that there definitely is a problem. She doesn’t know what to do either. My mom is HORRIBLE to my sister about her weight.

1068,EDPostRequests,1603791445,jiy21i,"For context I had disordered eating habits for much of my life, which were exacerbated in summer of 2018 due to a mix of extreme stress, depression, and being prescribed adderall for my ADHD. It was approaching dangerous levels and I was incredibly lucky to be able to wrestle myself out of that spiral before I did any permanent damagw. While I occasionally have a couple days at a time where I slip up and restrict, I really thought I had recovered. But I never fixed the underlying issues I guess, and now I'm seeing those old thinking patterns coming back and it's freaking me out.

The first time I'd dealt with those feelings coming back was when I started dating again this February. Someone invited me to get lunch with them and the idea of eating in front of them (or anyone who invited me on a date) made me feel sick to my stomach. I was eventually able to convince myself to overcome that and have a meal with the person anyway, so I figured that meant I was fine. Then quaruntine happened so I wasn't dating anyone and it was no longer an issue.

Now I'm seeing a few things that are worrying me. For one, my schedule is out of wack, so whether I mean to restrict or not, I'm often not really getting enough meals in a day. On top of that, I thought I was ready to buy a scale, and oh man that was a fucking dumb idea. I've gained a small amount of weight since quaruntine started and I felt so incredibly guilty and gross and I can't stop thinking about it. I'm not weighing myself that often, but I could easy see myself beginning to again if things don't start to get back to normal. Now, two of my housemates are moving out and I'll have new housemates at the beginning of the month. The idea of eating in front of my new housemates is terrifying to me. To the extent that I've honestly considered no longer buying anything unhealthy so I don't seem ""gross"". I feel so much shame around the idea of eating junk food and often times, when things have gotten worse, part of that mechanism has been my definition of ""junk food"" getting so warped that I consider almost anything unhealthy and shameful to eat. I think I'm still at the point that I can turn back and get back to ""normal"" again before this gets out of control, but I'm frustrated.

I really thought that I had fixed this, but now I'm wondering if I'll ever get to let my guard down and just live, without having to manage this and make sure I'm not falling into old habits. I just want to get to be normal.

1072,EDPostRequests,1603665281,ji2qxg,"I've been overweight for nearly my whole life, but I've always had a not-so-great relationship with food. 

At the end of last year, I began taking a new antidepressant, and it suppressed my appetite for two or three weeks. I believe this is when it began to get worse. I ate normally after those weeks passed, but the negative self-talk got worse than it ever has been, as if my brain were saying ""you stopped eating before, don't go back.""

Then, in January, my partner was diagnosed with cancer, and almost died from a pulmonary embolism. It looks like they're going to be okay now, but from January to around August, that wasn't so sure. On top of that, I've been going to therapy and, while it has helped with some things, it's also painful - I'm bringing up things I've never talked about before and realizing just how badly I've been treated in the past. On top of that, college has been extremely difficult, unrewarding, and unsatisfying. And then there's the pandemic, and everything else. Everything just felt hopeless and, to an extent, still feels hopeless and out of control.

In March is when I really began to restrict, and since June it's been particularly bad. If I eat over my self-imposed calorie limit, I feel incredibly anxious and panicky. If my partner brings home any cakes or take out, or any outside food, or cooks for me, I want to cry because I know they expect me to eat it, and that they're just being sweet, despite not having to at all - so I eat it, and I hate myself for it, and I hate myself for hating myself. My partner regularly comments on how little I eat, ""like a bird"". I tell them I'm fine, just not so hungry today, but it always strikes fear in me that they're gonna figure it out eventually.

I count calories obsessively, weigh myself everyday, and I've lost a significant amount of weight since January (still overweight, though, so no one seems to notice, besides my partner.)

I feel tired all the time, I get shaky, it's hard to concentrate, especially on school. I'm constantly thinking about food and planning out my meals and trying to make sure I count every single little thing. I'm always anxious to eat around others, and I've been noticing bruises on my legs where I've bumped into things that, before, never gave me bruises. I enjoy the feeling of an empty stomach, even when it hurts, because it makes me feel like I'm finally accomplishing something, that this, at least, I can control, and I can control well. Every day, I try to get away with eating as little as possible.

My therapist has brought up the possibility of receiving extra treatment from someone who specializes in eating and eating disorders, but I'm extremely hesitant. I know what I'm doing isn't good, exactly, but it's hard to think about it being a big enough issue to receive extra treatment for - that I'm not sick enough for that. ""I'm overweight anyways, and I have to lose weight anyways, so what's the problem?"" my brain says. I think I'm too scared to face the reality of what's happening to me, and what I'm doing to myself. I think I'm ashamed.

1075,EDPostRequests,1603591036,jhlc6v,"Hi, I'm a man in his 30s looking for support with binge eating. I've tried OA support groups - they have many online Zoom meetings focused on men. But their approach is too black &amp; white for me. I found the same with AA when I went there. I'm now 2+ years alcohol-free, but many of the same triggers which would induce drinking now just transferred to foods.

Almost all of the time I eat nutritiously. I don't track my food because it gets into ""unhealthy obsession"" territory. That's where OA fails me - any sponsor wants me to commit unwaiveringly to a strict portion-controlled plan, to the point of obsession. Then they say, ""Well are you committed to the plan or ARE YOU NOT?"" with this judgmental tone. (If you've had a good experience with OA or a 12-step program, I don't mean to diminish that. This is just what my experience has been.) Aside from that, I don't believe addiction is a disease or that the brain chemistry of alcoholics or compulsive eaters is hopelessly unchangeable and fundamentally different than ""normal"" people.

I do habitually eat whole, unprocessed, nutritious foods, mostly plant-based, and this serves me well nearly all of the time. I've already, slowly over the course of many years, developed long-term nutrition habits which work for me. I've even worked on mindfully noticing and honoring my hunger and fullness cues.

It's just the binges which are an issue, and the problem for me is emotional. It's those times when I feel anxious or out of control or frustrated or angry or overwhelmed or upset or hopeless. That's when I'd go out and buy a bunch of food that I wouldn't usually eat - processed, frozen, fast food, calorie-dense stuff. I know that it's an adaptive (maladaptive) coping mechanism to deal with unpleasant emotions. But I don't have it under control yet, and I feel like I'm alone in this battle.

Is there somewhere I can find some kind of sponsor-like support for this? Like someone to call when I'm feeling like I'm going to binge to talk me down off the ledge? Very few friends or family know about my binge eating. None of my guy friends do.

I just started seeing a new therapist and working through complex PTSD which came about as a response to childhood trauma. The binge eating certainly is a part of that, but it's not our focus in therapy, and I can't just call up my therapist any time I'm feeling like I need support.

I was conscious of the changes in my body but it didn’t worry me at all because I knew that it was normal for bodies to fluctuate, and I also was confident in myself to lose the weight I gained over the summer by exercising and eating right once I came back to the states.
My mom on the other hand was absolutely horrified by my appearance when she saw me as she was picking me up from the airport. She made so many comments (direct and indirect) about my weight and called me fat, made many comparisons between my body and my friend’s body, nit picked at my body parts and just overall made me feel extremely bad about myself for a while. She even made me get a blood test because she thought there was something wrong with my body that made me gain weight so quickly. Spoiler alert, my blood test came back completely normal. All this to say that I mostly blame my mom for the state that I am in right now. 

anyways. because I’m lazy and I don’t want to make this post too long, I’m going to list some of the things that I do or think that is or could be considered unhealthy. 

• I’m not eating a lot. Like scraps from the fridge + coffee/pastries at a cafe per day. 
• cooking/eating healthy is too much work. I’d rather just skip meals to lose weight cause it’s easier.
• I have a roommate who had stomach problems/withdrawal symptoms and was throwing up a lot and couldn’t really keep food down for a month-ish. She was worried that she had lost too much weight. I was jealous of her. 
• I never actually threw up after eating but I do have those thoughts every once in a while after I eat a lot of junk food. 
• When my hands starts shaking because I haven’t eaten anything all day, I feel accomplished and weirdly proud of myself. 
• A small part of me wants to get really really skinny to the point I look sickly just to spite my mom
• now that I’m listing all these things out I definitely realize this isn’t normal but at the same time I don’t really want change. It’s been about a two months since I’ve came back from my trip and I already feel like I lost all the weight I gained, but I’m afraid that once I start eating normally again I might bounce right back. 

I know in my head that what I’m doing right now isn’t healthy but I can’t get myself to take my own advice. I’m wondering if there’s any way I could break this mindset. I feel like if I let this go for longer this might end up snowballing to an actual ED so I want to nip this in the bud before it gets super serious.

Hey, I've never posted here before because I've tried ignoring my ED for the longest time, but enough is enough. Long story really short, I binge eat and it's compulsive. I lost xx kg over the past year, though, because of my anxiety disorder. But, after circumstances changing, my appetite came back. Alas, so did my binge eating. I don't really know why I binge eat, but it's gotten to the point where I've gained some weight back, and then of course my binge eating progressively worsens. It's an evil circle. I'm gonna try to get a nutritionist's help asap, because I'm tired of feeling out of control. I guess this was sort of a rant, but I was also wondering if anybody's overcome binge eating and ended up at a healthy weight? Or even gained more confidence in themselves, with a sense of ""control""?

Hi. 28NB AFAB here, and have had extensive therapy and treatment for anorexia in my teens and early 20s, managing pretty well now, with the normal ups-and-downs that come with recovery. I'm fairly sanguine that issues with food will be part of my life forever, but I'm maintaining a healthy just-underweight status for my height and my doctors are happy, so I'm not too worried about that. I know my triggers (stress, over-work, feeling out of control, looking at thinness content) and try to avoid and mitigate as best as I can, which has obviously been incredibly hard this year.

I live in a shared house with four other professionals, and recently we got a new housemate as one left to get married. I strongly suspect that the new girl has some sort of eating disorder, largely restrictive. She's much younger than me, just turned 21, and my suspicions started when she had an absolute meltdown about spilling some food. We went to help her because she was crying, and when another housemate suggested she throw it in the bathroom instead as we got a hoover she flushed it, rather than putting it in the bin. I see a lot of where I have been in her behaviours, and because we are in similar fields with her just starting out with training, and me in an established career I also know the pressures that are put on people, especially in this city and university.

She often comes down when I'm in the kitchen, and alongside other things it's triggering a relapse. I picked up a bread roll for lunch and she came into the kitchen, my brain immediately said 'throw it away or put it back in the pack' which...I did. The stupid competitive no-one-can-be-thinner-than-me voice is back, that I should stop eating. I know these are the irrational thoughts, and I'm terrified. I can't really move out, nor do I want to, as this has been my home for a few years now. I had a quiet word with another housemate about my suspicions, and opened up about my previous diagnosis. Nothing too severe, but so we can gently check on her because she's just moved to a new city, alone, knows no-one, and the pandemic is hardly conducive to forming a friendship group, which is a pretty perfect storm for restrictive habits deteriorating.

I'm unsure of what to do. I'm forcing myself to eat, but feeling such shame and guilt over it, and it's making me scared to be seen preparing or eating food. I also worry that given the inherently competitive nature of the disease, if she knows we know, or worse knows that I have a history with it, it will actually push her into getting worse. I currently don't have a therapist (financially non-viable, and they only really offer CBT which was appalling for both anorexia and depression for me, so unless I could go private then that's not really an option here) but I also have no idea how to approach this situation.",Request: Suspect my roommate has an ED,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/jpfihg/request_suspect_my_roommate_has_an_ed/,1604725285,06-11-20 17:01

I was recently diagnosed with an unspecified eating disorder most closely related to binge eating. My therapist said I scored at a “clinical"" level. She seemed very concerned. That was over a month ago with no real follow up. I also have other, fairly serious, mental and physical health concerns so I understand why it was put on the back burner. However, I'm at a loss as to what to do with this information. I’m not even sure what exactly she means by clinical. I'll definitely ask her but first, I wanted to know if anyone else has received a “clinical"" diagnosis and what that could mean for my treatment/prognosis.

1096,EDPostRequests,1604399089,jn7ywx,"I come from a pretty size-attuned culture where thinness is a huge thing. If you’re not Asian-sized skinny (our L size is basically a US / UK / AU medium or smaller, or an EU36 if it’s stretchy), then you need to lose weight. 

Weight talk is a thing where I’m from. Everybody seems to be allowed to have an opinion on your weight, your size, how you look, and how you *should* look — family, relatives, friends, classmates, even colleagues. Diet fads are a thing. Metabolism pills, herbs, coffees and teas are widely used. We have a whole “healthier choice” movement and if you’re not trying to engage in it, then you’re not trying hard enough to be healthy. We are BMI-obsessed. Clothes go up to an Asian large, but go down to an Asian xx-small (because xs isn’t small enough). 

And I’ve struggled with my weight a lot. The first time I thought I was disgusting, I was 8 — wearing a dance leotard and a skirt for a dance competition, thinking my arms were huge and that my stomach was literally bulging out and spilling over my skirt. I looked like any normal 8’yo girl, like the pics you’d find on google, but I felt disgusted with myself, at that young age. My mum had said something along the lines of “your tummy looks quite big in this costume” and so I assumed I was fatter than everyone else. 

Things have since worsened, of course. Put simply, jokes made by relatives like “I saw a really big-sized person downstairs, I didn’t know it was actually (my name)!” / “wow you look really ugly in this photo!”, comments by my parents like “you need to exercise more” / “if you exercised more your joints wouldn’t hurt” / “don’t eat dinner anymore, and don’t eat your whole lunch” / “stop eating rice or noodles, it’s so much carbs” / “you really put on weight, are you planning to do something about it”, classmates: “wow she has a fat belly” (i was eleven and at a healthy weight), colleagues: “you would look prettier if you were skinnier” (i’d just lost some weight after going on a no-carb diet, and still wasn’t skinny emough), these comments from other people just made me feel so sick of myself. And eventually, the thoughts became my own. If no-one else was saying it to me, then I’d be saying it to myself.

Across the years I’ve engaged in food restricting behaviour (calories restriction / skipping meals / starving myself when i felt hungry), partook in diet fads like liquid diets (only soups), water-only diets (only mineral water and a handful of diet pills a day, no food at all, marketed as a “body cleanse”), and diet pills like garcinia cambogia carb-blocking supplements. I used creams like slimming gels &amp; fat-burning creams locked in with cling wrap. I went for slimming programs like toasting myself in a machine meant to “sculpt”, and then had to sit in a sauna for 30 minutes to “sweat the fat” out of my body. I used to be obsessed with exercise workouts. Not one message I sent wasn’t about some kind of workout routine or challenge. I was obsessed with making my collarbones obvious, and my hipbones, and making sure that I could see at least my bottom-most rib. I hated the fact that the edge of my shoulders were rounded instead of hard, boney edges. I weighed myself day in and day out, and the slightest weight gain would leave me feeling terrible. I would try to puke, or try to give myself food poisoning just so that everything that went into my body would come out — I never binged, but I needed it to not stay in my system. When i couldn’t make myself purge in that manner, I turned to taking laxatives on a daily basis for a substantial period of time. Despite everything I did, the numbers still climbed (despite some occasional dips). 

And every single time I ate more than I felt I should have and thought that I made my stomach (the organ) expand, I would have to “pay it back” by starving myself and skipping / rationing meals to get my stomach to shrink again.If my stomach shrank, so would my appetite.And I had a crazy amount of appetite to be honest, I was always dancing. And I would get told (even when I was dancing 6 days a week for hours at a time), that I still wasn’t exercising enough and needed to do more — I was barely at home at this point and was getting increasingly burnt out; I stopped dancing once I hit my limit. 

And then I eventually felt so bad about my body that I would cry looking at myself in the mirror before a shower, and squeeze my flab and claw at it. I wanted to take a slicing knife and cut it all off. I stopped weighing myself. When I lived abroad alone I stopped restricting my eating, ate whenever I felt empty (emotionally because I was getting depressed, but mistook it for physical hunger) and put on a ton of weight. When I came home from abroad I didn’t want to meet anyone at all for any “welcome home” meet-ups. I didn’t want to celebrate festivities. All I wanted to do was sleep and die alone out of embarrassment. I didn’t need to hear the comments because I already felt that way myself. 

I couldn’t &amp; still can’t look at myself in the mirror and in pictures without feeling gargantuan. I feel like I’m taking too much space in this world, because I’m not small in clothing sizes. If my bum has to squeeze past someone else in the aisle of a crowded bus, it’s because I’m fat. If I brush shoulders with the person sitting beside me on a train, it’s because I’m fat. Nothing looks good on my body. My nose is too big for my face. I assume that I’m twice the size of my friends. I am literally twice the size of my petite mother. I still check my body in the mirror everyday. I body-check my wrists. I have a terrible relationship with my body, myself, how I look, my clothing sizes, fitness, exercise, diets, expectations in general (because I was never slim enough, never exercised enough, never lost enough weight).

These days, I’ve started weighing myself again since having to attend monthly psychiatric appointments for moderate-severe depression. I’d been losing lots of weight after eating half a meal once a day for months, due to depression’s poor appetite. And recently I’ve gained a very tiny bit of weight that I had lost, after starting to eat breakfast and a fuller lunch again because I started going back to work / existing outside of my house again. And the super tiny weight gain has had me reeling. I kind of made a competition with myself to lose more and more weight each time I went for the appointments — if I didn’t weigh lighter than the last appointment, then I was a complete fat fucking failure. 

I’m not at a healthy weight per my BMI. I carry quite a bit of muscle from my dancing days, but I also still have some flab. My recent weight gain puts me back in the Obese category. I’m somewhere between a US14/16. It makes me sick. And I still do this thing where if I ate breakfast for the day (a roll of bread), then I could only eat half my lunch and couldn’t let myself eat dinner — if I was hungry in the evening, I would have to make friends with gastric pains and mineral water. I’m doing it right now tbh. 

And I hate it. I hate having this constant balancing scale going on in my head — so much compensatory behaviour. I’m sick of myself. I feel like my brain and my body are both conspiring against me, with these body image obsessed thoughts and depression (outside of body image) and all. I feel worthless. I hate how I look. I hate how I’m always thinking about compensating for portions that I eat (even if food and calories aren’t on my mind 24/7). 

At this point I don’t know if it’s just my internalized asian fatphobia towards myself (I’m body-positive with all of my friends and family, but am very hypocritically the opposite with my own body), or if I’ve really been taking it too far with my weight management habits. I never thought that I had an eating disorder because I was overweight (because maybe it was normal to feel this way about a body that wasn’t the ideal average-looking skin?), but after becoming more aware of eating disorder stories by athletes / dancers / figure skaters recently, i find myself identifying with so many of their stories leading up to getting treatment for an ED, right down to rituals, habits and thoughts. Gracie Gold is basically the olympic athlete version of my own experience with my body. 

I don’t know, am I displaying subtle signs (or maybe glaring signs) of a possible eating disorder? Or are they just disordered eating habits? Do I need help? Where is the line between normal weight management vs. probably needing to see a professional for eating-related issues? 

I see my psychiatrist this week, and have been thinking about highlighting this body image issue with her, but I’m worried that she’ll say “well it’s because you’re clinically obese, it’s normal to want to lose weight”. But I may bring it up to her if someone can convince me that I actually should. I’m just tired of feeling like this.

I've always been a little on the overweight side, but nothing drastic, for majority of my life. Until lockdown happened and I, like many, used the extra time and energy to motivate myself and achieve my ""dream body"". Now 6 months down the road I fear what the future has in store for me.

 It started off with just calorie counting, and then lowering the amount each time until a few weeks ago when I realised how badly I had messed up. I was in a constant grumpy mood and I would be so hungry to the point my stomach ached. Now I only eat between 12-6PM and I don't really have any appetite anymore, I definitely do not meet my caloric intake, along with plenty of exercise 6 days/wk. 

It caught me off guard last night how I have literally no control over my eating, if anything I get more positive attention now than I ever have before. The tears that followed hurt the most.

I am kinda self-conscious of my body but have never intentionally not eaten food to remain thin or thrown up food purposely.

I usually eat when I feel hungry, and eat until I feel full, although a small/medium salad will make me feel full. In addition, when I am stressed, my appetite is the first thing to go. Sometimes I feel slightly guilty for eating healthy as that won't help me put on weight. I brought these concerns up to my mother, and she stated that I probably have a small stomach.  

I recently switched doctors, and my new one seems highly critical of eating habits and blatantly told me that I look ""thinner than an anorexic"".

I’m (20 NB) am worried about my girlfriend (19 MtF) and her eating.

For some background, My girlfriend is a pre-transition trans woman. she came out as trans a few years ago, but she hasn’t been able to go to any sort of therapy. At first, this was because she couldn’t afford it. Now it’s because she not only is a full time student, but also works full time. She is hypoglycemic (I don’t know if this is diagnosed by a doctor, but she said she had hypoglycemia). She also has quite a bit of trauma related to her upbringing. She volunteered at a hospital for many years, and grew to believe that it is rude to eat in front of other people. She also believes it is rude to ask someone for food, or to take a second helping of food at a meal. I often have to make her eat by eating with her. (This is a problem for me, because I have gastric sleeve surgery, and can not eat a lot of food.) Often when she eats at my house, she will only take a small amount of food and later mention that she was hungry, but then when I try to get her to eat she refuses.

She’s never been great about eating enough, but she recently got a new job where she is less active, and someone made a comment that she had started gaining a small amount of weight. Since she has started this new job, it has become even harder for me to get her to eat, and on days that we are not together (because of her schedule, i only really get to see her on weekends), she will mention that she has only eaten 1 or 2 things through the day.

Today we were talking on her way to work, and she mentioned that she was hungry and that she hadn’t eaten all day. I told her she should stop and get something to eat, as her work wouldn’t be upset if she was a few minutes late (and they wouldn’t be). She said no, and that her work ethic is more important her her than her health. I offered to send food to her work so she could eat during her break, but she told me not to, saying that she wouldn’t be allowed to bring it in and that she was fine.

I brought up that I was worried about her eating, and she denied it. In her eyes, she thinks that she eats in a healthy way. I don’t know how to help her. I’m worried one day she’s going to go too long without eating and faint while she’s driving or woodworking.

Context: I work a lot and don’t have much time to eat, or I at least don’t allow myself much tome to eat.

I get one break a day within a 9-10 hour period and work in fairly manual labor. I head in about an hour early (a few others do as well) and for breakfast, I’ll grab a bag of chips and cookies out of my bag after setting everything up, and maybe an iced coffee depending. I try to save as much money as possible. For our lunch break close to noon, I usually take a 15-20 minute break and for much of the day try to stay as busy as possible because working means less time to think and I’ve been struggling with depression, so I work almost constantly. I think this results in me burning many more calories than I take in and yes, my lunch is also chips or crackers or maybe a cup of noodles if I feel like if I have the time.

I have known my friend for more than 15 years, and ever since high school, she has been ""on a diet"". I probably have never known her not concerned with her weight.

Every couple of years, her weight fluctuates up and down a lot. Her social media is full of her ""before and after pictures"" with her captions saying things like ""I can't believe I let myself go."" or ""every comment on my post, I will do 5 squats"" or ""starting today, I will stop eating carbs"".

She reached out to me recently in the hopes that I ""keep her accountable"" since she gained some weight from COVID. I am not super healthy, but I do try to balance my lifestyle by going to the gym and eating healthier meals. She texted me a few times telling me she wants bread or rice really bad but she's on keto and intermittent fasting. Every time, I would tell her eating carbs is okay as long as it is in moderation and that restricting herself is not sustainable in the long run.

I (18F) am a college freshman living with a roommate (19F) in a small double room this year. Before the semester started, I knew that my roommate struggled with body issues, but the full extent didn't become clear to me until we began living together. 

The transition to college is hard for some people because they have to create their own schedules and make their own choices, and this wrecked havoc on her eating and exercise habits. She became obsessive with reaching 10k steps a day, working out, and eating at a deficit. I first tried to refer her to campus resources, but due to insurance issues and scheduling conflicts, it didn't work out. As time progressed, her clothes became too big and she has now been showing negative health affects. 

About two months ago, I tried to set boundaries about bringing up body/food/working out in conversation inside the room. At first, she really respected this and I thought things would be better, but now that finals stress is hitting, she's returned to working out in front of me in the dorm and make more offhand comments that she doesn't realize could be upsetting. I try not to engage in those comments, but I want to be a supportive friend so sometimes I end up talking about body anyways to try to make her feel better. 

I've struggled with body image issues my whole life as a taller, midsize girl. Feeling like I stood out, like I wasn't represented in media, etc. Before coming to college, I finally felt confident in myself despite weight gain from medications and quarantine. My roommate is pretty petite, and seeing her struggle with these issues has started to affect me deeply. I question everything I eat around her, and when she complains about not feeling attractive and not working out enough, it makes me feel as though I'm not enough either. 
(Ex: if she's so small and thinks she's too ""fat,"" what does that mean about me?)

It hasn't actually gotten bad again, but it's enough that I've been trying to keep an eye on myself. Now, I'm realizing my housemate has some food issues and they're starting to creep into my head.

My restriction has always been very off and on, and because of this I've never really had any strict food rules. Instead, it's usually more of a self-competitive thing that will last for a few months and then die down again. My housemate, however, is super strict about rules. I was a bit aware of this beforehand, but I assumed that because I've never really had rules like this in the past they wouldn't really affect me. I think I was wrong. I know my housemate doesn't mean anything by mentioning them, but almost every time I eat now I think about what I'm doing would break their rules.

SEEKING ADVICE!

Okay so, she has had a very rough time with people being very judgmental/aggressive about her ED, so bad that she doesn’t talk to anyone about it. I’m apparently the first to really know what’s going on, and it concerns me quite a lot. She tells me she feels safe with me, and I’m trying not to push any boundaries, because I know that being aggressive about helping her, will just shut her down. 

She told me that she’d dealt with depression, and stress from school 1,5 year back, and that her ED might have come out of this. To me, she doesn’t seem depressed anymore. Still stressed, and for sure having anorexia. She eats x calories (very low) a day, and if she eats more she goes to the toilet to vomit it up. Were both into fitness, so I’ve kind of been in the same place as she has, at least I’d say I’ve had a taste of it. No puking though, just irrational control over my calorie intake. She says she deep down knows this ED is a problem, and that it isn’t healthy, but that the thought isn’t really present. She’s sometimes hard to communicate with, and is tired all the time, which I understand. For now, I’m just trying to get her to open up as much as possible. Not forcing, just implying that I’d like to know what’s going on, because I care about her. If she doesn’t feel like talking about it that day, then sure, we’ll do it another time, NO PRESSURE. So that’s all fine and dandy, but how would I every get her comfortable enough, to actually seek professional help. Her mother screwed it up by being aggressive (In that sickly worried mother kind of way), and the only psychologist she’d every had wasn’t what she needed, so know she just thinks that every psychologist isn’t for her. “It doesn’t do anything for me”.

What do I do?

TL;DR GF met aggression when she had really bad anorexia . Resulted in shutting everyone out. She let me in, and now I don’t know what to do since she doesn’t trust anyone with her issue, not even professionals.",Request: I (22M) just found out how serious my new girlfriend (21F) of 2 months anorexia is.

I have a hard time keeping a consistent eating and sleeping cycle. At least I think this is where my problem stems from. When in high school I would fall asleep 6am in the weekends and then be tired the entire week. But I ate dinner with my family and normally lunch in the break, so a bit of energy was left.

3 days ago I ate a piece of bread and like 100g of pasta. 2 days ago I ate a piece of bread and a bit of cereal. Yesterday I ate some serial. Today I just ate one piece of bread and can’t eat anymore. 

I get nausea whenever I’m “full”, so it’s impossible to eat more. 

I can’t really start a regular eating cycle because I can’t eat anything the first 6 hours of the day, and then I fall asleep again because I’m tired due to lack of food. Then I wake up and eat a bit but then nausea.

When I was around 12 or 13 my mom informed me that I was allergic to gluten (even though I had never been tested for Celiac's or gluten intolerance). Her explanation was that because she had it (she did take tests for gluten intolerance and Celiac's that came back negative for it) that I must be. I was a slightly chubby kid and I was very awkward in puberty. From that moment until I turned 18 and left our house I was not allowed to eat any bread or anything unless it was gluten free (which was very limited when I was young). My mom would also insist that she pack my lunch also up until the point that I graduated, which on top of being embarrassing in general, it was all diet food. Mainly beans and rice (which is not even something our culture traditionally eats). For a period in high school I also developed an eating disorder that started with trying to starve myself and then progressed to throwing up. I would sit and watch TV with my mom while ""eating"" dinner with her, but the whole time I was just chewing my food and spitting it in a napkin.

my psychiatrist didn’t really react much after she asked me to elaborate on why i didn’t want to get weighed at registration anymore; she did say it was okay to skip the weigh-in though. i guess that’s good enough? 

my therapist and i talked about it today after i wrote her a mid-week email while having one of my strong self-hate, pre-weigh-in panic days. and then right before the session, i’d eaten a fuller lunch (first meal) because a family member over-ordered at a restaurant, which left me wanting to make myself throw up in the therapy clinic’s bathroom while waiting for my session to start. i cried in the session, talking about how i felt really bothered by how much this obsession with restrictive eating, weight gain / loss, and purging urges were all living in my head rent free. i felt extra bad bringing this up because i’m already brimming with a ton of other unresolved issues relation to complex trauma and depression; i was worried that my therapist would be overwhelmed by all of my issues and give up on me. it just feels like everything is just resurfacing with a vengeance this year and i hate it, and i’m tired. 

anyway, yeah... my therapist suggested practicing more body neutrality / neutralizing the thoughts &amp; urges. a big part of it is self-compassion, which i struggle with wrt depression &amp; self-harm too. i want to eat 3 proper meals a day and not feel scared shitless about weight gain, or guilt and shame and panic about feeling full and satiated — there are people that enjoy this, and i want to be able to appreciate it too. i’m just pretty lost on how to get from *here* to somewhere good.

Hi,

I have a child (16trans) that is dealing with an eating disorder. I have a couple questions about how you would want your parents to approach a ED. So, my child is convinced that they can't properly swallow food. We have seen NUMEROUS doctors, specialists, went for biopsy, x-rays, etc. Honestly, I was getting frustrated at first, but I'm really trying to trust that they know something is going on. It's just hard when specialists and doctors tell me ""We don't see anything"" or ""nothing irregular"". I've tried talking about her eating maybe having a psychological component to it as well; she won't eat cause she knows it will hurt, but there isn't anything there to cause hurt. The big thing I have a question with is this though: the other day, they asked us to get some Coca-Cola for them. Apparently it helps dislodge food stuck in someone's throat. I'm just nervous because in two days, they have had 4 half litres of Coca-Cola. We're not the healthiest family, but pop is seldomly in the house. If it was JUST coke that helped or that allowed them to eat, I'd be okay with it, but I'm afraid it will be taken advantage of. Reason being, when this all started, it was thought reasonable by the teen that they could eat waffles and syrup every night for dinner. We bought extra Ensure drinks, soups, noodles that were soft, but waffles (crunchy when toasted) didn't cause pain, but soup (a liquid with few solids, if any) did. Again, my mom has noticed that our teen will eat any sweets at her house, but skip any meal. We have sweets in our house, we buy cookies and every weekend, we do snack bowls. Candy is indeed dandy, and I have no problem with it in the house.

I just want to support our teen, but I don't know how to react when we're told one thing by doctors and another by our teen. I want to know how to approach a topic to our teen about these things.

As a add, our teen is doing Counseling (our teen was adopted 2 and a half years ago and experienced all the horrendous things of foster care and drug abuse from birth parents), and has more specialist appointments, but after having a scope, barium swallow and biopsy, I'm not sure what other medical components there are left; that's for the doctors to tell us, but I don't know what else to say to our teen on the subject of their ED (that they bring up a lot more often then us). I just feel helpless about this all, cause they're in pain and it takes a toll oh them as well as all the other family members.

Since I was little, I never liked eating. My mom had to force me to eat food; giving me proteins, smoothies and healthy drinks so I could put on some weight. Until she had to leave me and I had to go live with my father who didn’t really care about my eating habits. I would only eat snacks and just a little amount of food because I wasn’t interested in eating at all. And I became close to underweight. Fortunately, I’m with my mom now and I have gained some weight but I’m still skinny. I eat better now but there are days where I would eat a lot and then weeks would go by before I start eating properly again. Like in those weeks, I could go a whole day without eating at all. And most of the times, I would wake up feeling heavy on my chest and I had to throw up phlegm so I would feel better. Like every time I’m feeling anxious when waking up, doing this fixes it.

1147,EDPostRequests,1604745512,jpoqhe,"(Hey mods! Could you post this for me possibly? Feel free not to post if it violates anything. :) )

Hello friends. I was wondering if you could shed some insight on something I am struggling with right now. I've struggled with disordered eating in the past, but never for more than, I dunno, maybe 3-4 months at a time? I'm just wondering - is it possible to go through ""episodes"" or something similar of disordered eating? Do I really have an issue, or am I just making this a ""choice"" for myself?

A little background if it's possibly helpful: the last time I restricted and had terrible body image issues, I ended up gaining a bunch of weight due to what I now think might be binging because of a long work hours + extreme hunger combo, and I stopped restricting soon after due to just...being too stressed about other things and needing food to do my job correctly, I guess?

My restricted eating habit has started up again in the past month along with a newfound thing of purging. In the past two weeks, I've lost a number of pounds that's relatively significant for someone my size and I'm now the lightest I've been in my adult life. I can't help it. I was losing weight as a stress response and it just triggered me into loving that number on the scale going down once more. 

I wasn't eating much in the first place, but now I eat half (or less) of that on a daily basis. I can't eat a piece of Halloween candy after dinner without feeling completely disgusting and going to throw it up. Even worse, my roommates tend to involuntarily trigger me with comments about their own weight - both whom are perfectly fine and healthy and make them as self-deprecatory jokes rather than actual concerns, I think - and the local eating disorder center is booked out until January, so I have no idea how to deal with roommates + holiday eating by myself. Watching people eat sets me off. Hearing people eat sets me off. I enjoy the food I do eat, but I eat so little and so slowly that I can no longer do it in front of other people for fear of them commenting on my weight or on my food. It’s seriously disrupting my daily routine, but I haven’t been able to stop lately, and I’m only getting more paranoid about calories and the way I look.

Here’s the thing. I don’t know if it’ll be like last time, where I went back to regular eating patterns over the course of a summer and didn’t have any severe issues for another two years (which is now). Maybe it will, or maybe it’ll continue forever. I know the general rule is that this is a mental illness and not a choice. I’m so worried I’m making myself go through “phases” or something for attention, but at the same time…this is making my anxiety/depression/body dysmorphia so much worse, or vice versa, and as much as I tell myself it’s BS, I truly believe the awful things I feel about myself and my body, because I can only see myself as disgusting.

Hi everyone, I need some advice on  what to do about this. Little backstory first - I (F26) have suffered  mainly from bulimia since I was around the age of 13 - this is something  I feel I am fully in control of now and I am hoping to be able to get  my general health back onto a better path. This to me isn't just my  physical health in terms of my weight but also my mental well-being and I  feel like I basically need to learn how to eat. I have been looking  around at a few options and decided to give this a go... Basically, I  joined Noom (a weight loss program) yesterday and was shocked that there was no mention of eating  disorders or any questions asked regarding potential issues. I decided  to send an email framing my concerns (see below) and I was shocked at their response (also see below). I'm in shock at their decision to cancel  my subscription without any warning and essentially push me away, I  understand they don't want to be liable for any issues but considering I  opened with some positivity about the service I'm quite shocked. I  wanted to express my concern that an app such as this, clearly designed  for weight loss and draws people in who feel like they have no other  options left to turn to has no screening for these issues and believe  this is extremely irresponsible. Even Slimming world has a tick box  section asking if you have any previous diagnoses. He mentioned that  helping navigate an eating disorder is not within the scope of practice.  This is also not what I was expecting from a weight loss app but I  would at least expect someone who is dealing with people who are wanting  to lose weight to be aware of the signs of these disorders. I believe  that certain safeguards need to be in place to protect people who are  already psychologically predisposed to develop a serious eating disorder  or to relapse into one. Considering this app is about the psychology of  food and weight loss they don't seem to be concerned about the issues I  have raised. 

Any help or advice on how to reply to them would be  greatly appreciated or even just any opinions you have yourself. Feel  free to message me directly as well. Thanks

The contents of my email: 

Good morning,

I  have only been on Noom for 2 days so far and I'm pleasantly surprised. I  was fully expecting this to be given a meal plan and to be left to my  own devices but I've enjoyed the reading material so far and I'm looking  forward to meeting my coach and group.

My  only issue so far is there has been no mention of eating disorders. As  someone who has suffered for over 10 year with various eating disorders  and disordered eating habits I do find this quite alarming. I'm at a  place now where I feel I am able to deal with my own issues and I know  how far I can push myself without falling back into old ways. I would  suggest even a simple option when signing up and filling out personal  details asking if any previous eating disorders have been diagnosed  before to make the coach aware that this could be an issue that could  come up and may need addressing. Also being able to be part of a group  with other people who are recovering would be something I would find  very helpful.

I would also like to  know if this is something that coaches are trained in and aware of? I  understand that not everyone would specialise in this area but I believe  that it is imperative to have the basic knowledge to recognise the  signs of an eating disorder before it get to a point that it may need  medical attention. One Thing I was shocked by is the suggestion to weigh  yourself every day. This is the first thing you are advised against  when you are in eating disorder recovery.

Thank you for your time.

Hi Hannah​,

Thank  you for providing feedback to our CEO Saeju Jeong. I’m a senior support  specialist and I’m reaching out to let you know that Saeju had a chance  to look at your message and we’ll be including your feedback in our  discussions.

We have looked into  this matter and although it is unfortunate, it does appear that our  program isn't the right one to meet your needs at this time.

All  health coaches at Noom work within what is called a scope of practice,  and helping someone navigate the challenges of an eating disorder are  not within that scope.

Although  our program is rooted in a variety of psychological tools, it is not a  comprehensive, individualized treatment nor is it intended to replace  any type of mental health or medical treatment. While we understand and  commend you for not engaging in the aforementioned behaviors recently  and being committed to your recovery, we feel that this program is not  going to be able to provide the help you are seeking. We recommend  reaching out to your primary care physician or other treatment provider  to determine the best individualized program to meet your needs.

In  light of this information, we went ahead and processed your  cancellation and we have also issued you a refund of £14.41 which will  be credited back to your PayPal account linked to  h\*\*nah@\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.co.uk. Please allow 2-5 business days to see the  refund credited to your account.

We sincerely appreciate your message and feedback and we wish you the best!

I want to make sure I'm resolving your issue before I close your ticket. Remember - we’re always here to help. Best, Jeff

TL,DR: I feel a compulsion to check  the scale before I eat. Was curious if anyone else had experience  dealing with this or any tips to help.

I’m  22 F and I guess I’m maybe average weight, if anything a bit over, but  I’ve always had a horrible self esteem. For the past year or so I’ve  kind of plateaued with mild weight gain every so often. I’ve done keto  and at this point I’m pretty terrified of certain carbs but I do still  eat them sometimes. It’s hard for me to find food I like that’s  affordable and easy to make. I guess I’m kind of a picky eater, but a  lot of healthy foods make me gag they just taste so bad to me (yes, I’ve  tried a lot of these healthy things very recently).

Because  I have a hard time exercising without getting sick (I have a history of  GI problems affecting this), I’m more self conscious than ever about my  weight. Every time I get hungry, I have a compulsion to step on the  scale first to see where my weight is at. If it looks like it’s higher I  modify my food to eat less.

Does  anyone have experience with this? I feel like it’s debilitating but I  also don’t want to gain weight so I feel the need to constantly watch it  even though that won’t help.

So  about a month ago I had to go to Urgent care for something, and when I  was put on the scale I got so upset because I didn’t eat a lot at the  time, and I was on a med that made me constantly sick to my stomach  after eating or drinking, and I had gained a few pounds.

When  I got home, I downloaded Loseit, and stopped taking the one medication.  For about a week I didn’t eat more than a bite of something a day,  because I was so upset about the weight. Well, I got back to eating a  bit, but I’ve been keeping it under a certain number of calories a day,  and tracking everything. I’ve been making sure to eat under what is a  recommended amount of calories a day, no matter if I got a coffee that  morning that’s half or what. On the days I’ve broken it(there’s only  been a couple) I don’t eat the next day. I know technically you’re  supposed to eat more than that, but I just can’t without feeling really  down and overthinking every thing.

1154,EDPostRequests,1605870196,jxn3x3,"Hi there. For several years, probably beginning in middle school, I [22M] have slowly been losing my appetite. As of now, I seldom have a desire to eat anything whatsoever, even if I'm in pain due to hunger. It's such a strange experience that is difficult to describe. I might go an extended time without eating and my stomach is SCREAMING at my brain to get food in there ASAP, but my brain doesn't comprehend that it's something I actually need to act on. The feeling of hunger has almost become a bodily sensation I've gotten used to, like wearing shoes or a hat for a while. It feels as if there is a complete disconnect between my sense of hunger and the part of my brain that gets me to do things. I think that because this appetite reduction happened slowly over a long period of time, I didn't notice it creeping up on me until recently. 

About a week ago, I had a vision/hallucination that a red dragon approached me on a cloudy mountain top and warned me of my imminent death. The dragon left and I sat still for a very long time, meditating I guess? I just watched as the days and seasons came and went, not knowing what was going to happen or why. Then suddenly there was a thundering sound from the sky and a much larger polychromatic dragon came billowing towards me and started vomiting over the side of the mountain. I fell off and drowned in the vomit avalanche. It was at this point that I snapped out of it. Something about this just clicked in my head and I realized I might die if I don't start eating a bit more than a light snack or two each day. I started crying and the tears just wouldn't stop.

I feel embarrassed to reach out because it seems so stupid on the outside looking in. Like, ""Dude, just eat some fucking food even if you don't feel like it."" But my mind goes to this mystical place almost 24/7. I don't know exactly what I do there, but it paralyzes me. I'm not able to properly get out of bed most days. Lying in bed from the moment I wake up until I fall asleep again, only getting up to piss or grab a light snack, has been my average day for longer than I'd like to admit. My mind is essentially blank, with no coherent trains of thought (unless I force myself to try) or an inner voice pushing me to be better. It's just this limbo, almost trance-like state I don't even realize I'm in while I'm in it. 

I don't know if this is an eating disorder, (obviously it's not anorexia or bulimia as I'm not doing it intentionally to lose weight) but there is definitely a pattern of unintentional caloric restriction and weight loss. Please help guide me. I have no idea what to do and feel like I'm teetering on the edge of sanity.

They told me they have been binge eating for a period of a couple of days and then eating little or nothing for a day or two, then repeating the cycle.

When they told me I was supportive, and took the proper actions based on research - being supportive, not saying ""why can't you just stop,"" not commenting on appearance, asking what I can do to help, etc. etc.  When I speak with them they are not overly concerned about their appearance anyway, so it's hard to think that it's focused on appearance, especially because they have had other problems with food (sensitive stomach/difficulty understanding and eating only what foods work for them and don't cause their stomach to act up).  They asked me to help by being an accountability partner for them.

I was briefly able to see a nutritionist but have since stopped because of financial difficulties. On the other hand, my partner, who is living with body dysmorphia in addition to ED, is much more familiar and well versed with terms. But irregardless of this, we both struggle with eating, when we are together and apart. 

Recently they told me that what I thought was encouraging them to eat is in reality shaming them. (for example, someone offered to pay for their groceries and they didn’t get really anything at all, so I tried to push them to take advantage of it). I apologized to them bc that’s obviously not helpful. 

I can see us both deteriorating in every way. I don’t know how to support them without being hypocritical or shaming. What are things we can do when eating/trying to cook meals together? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any help is deeply appreciated

1162,EDPostRequests,1605782943,jx0m25,"When I was young (4-13) my father had custody of us. He bought drugs and alcohol, but rarely food. He often sold his foodstamps, so my brother and I walked home with food from the church and that was often our only way to eat, aside from hot dogs and bologna. 

I remember eating pebbles, lemon grass and clover flowers... I shoplifted and stole bird seed from the neighbor's feeders. I often traveled in search of food outside, even dumpster diving at the stores. Summers were rough, because that was the end of school lunches. 

When I was 13, mom got custody... Which was for the best! I was finally safe! But we both tried to make up for years lost, in food. She knew we went though hell so she'd get us whatever we wanted to eat. I was eating huge amounts of food, any hour of the day/night. I could sit and eat 4 packs of ramen, my own medium pizza even. It was never enough. My brother and I even started fighting over food when things got a bit scarce. I tripled my weight in a couple years.

Now I'm 27, I've attempted to get help over the years of therapy, but I still have food insecurity. I've become severely diabetic and the injections aren't helping. 

My doctor has told me I need to go vegan... Has told me to cut my plate size. Told me to limit myself. But has also told me she doesn't want to help me in ways until I ""try harder"" and lose weight. 

I've cut my eating in half- even moreso. I don't eat after 10pm (my husband gets off work at 10pm, so I can't eat sooner) I cut all sweets and don't drink any sugar. My doctor doesn't believe me. She suggested getting the belly band, but only if I ""try harder"".

Today I ate grapes for breakfast, 2 slices of pizza for lunch, and carrots and lite ranch for a snack. My sugar is WAY HIGH... (Typical)

I just don't know what to do. I'm so hungry, I have no energy, no self esteem... I was doing better when I was going to physical therapy and getting my spine injections, but haven't gone since the virus got worse (my community is anti science, anti mask. A lot of cases)

Whether it’s what I’m having for the next meal, how much I’ve had and if it’s going to leave kjs for later (I on and off calorie count, but these kinds of thoughts have been around since before I did) wanting to starve, trying not to binge, etc etc.

1168,EDPostRequests,1605696130,jwdl00," Hi! I’m a 17 year old boy, and I’ve been obese for most of my life. I dropped a considerable amount of weight through healthy diet and exercise from 2018-19 and have been maintaining my body by moderating my diet and hitting the gym often. Earlier this year, gyms in my country closed down due to the coronavirus, so I couldn’t continue my workouts. On top of that, I find comfort in food and used that to cope with everything that was going on at that time. While I barely gained any weight, I was very afraid of being obese again and I began starving myself to compensate for my unhealthy eating (I had done this a couple times before) When I was obese, I was severely mocked, ridiculed and at times harassed for my body which had a deep impact on me, and continues to do so till now. This causes me to go into cycles of unhealthy eating and then very restrictive eating/starving and always being concerned (high-key obsessed) about calories and healthiness and my body image. While I’m at a normal weight for my height and age, I’m unable to accept my body the way it is and I always feel like if I don’t control my diet I’ll become obese again. I’m currently starving myself again, and I’m honestly miserable. While I do believe I look good I feel like absolute shit, but if I think about eating something I like I feel scared/guilty about not looking the way I do anymore or losing my hard work or whatever. All of this is having a huge impact on my mental health, and I’m afraid it will affect my body too in the long run. Can someone please help me identify what this is? And how to treat it?

1172,EDPostRequests,1605695643,jwdhxi,"Hi guys!
I’m a 19 year old male that is currently in university. I’ve been pretty overweight my entire life and felt quite insecure about it. When quarantine (lockdown) in my country started, I decided to pick up running. I started off slowly as I could hardly run 1km but in 2 months, I was running 5km everyday. This continued for around 4 months. After the 4 months, I started to become underweight, at this point my sister asked me to join her in a class of F45. F45 is a circuit training program that does cardio and resistance alternating days. I grew to love it (only ever did cardio and never weight training) and the interaction between people (because running was always alone, however, at the start of working out I sometimes ran with my sister). I picked up F45 really quickly and I now join their classes 5 times a week (closed on weekends) so I still run one day on the weekend. I've given myself one rest day and it feels like a perfectly balanced exercise routine. I’ve been going to F45 for the past 3 months now. I started to notice I had a problem because I would make myself feel extremely guilty for missing a workout to the point where I would get out of bed (11pm) and put my running clothes on and go for a “quick” 5km run. Or if I ate 2 burgers for dinner instead of one, I would need to do a run, sometimes at 1 am when I got back from a BBQ with friends. I even skipped out early one time as I felt disgusted by how much I ate. I started getting a really negative mindset when it came to exercising and don't really enjoy it anymore because it feels like just a routine. It feels like something I have to do in the day in order to feel happy about myself. The coaches at F45 keep warning me about overtraining and my family members but I always get defensive when they start bringing up the topic. One thing I hate so much is when people say “omg ur so skinny!”. Since I haven't seen my friends in a while (due to lockdown) they were all shocked at the complete body transformation I had undergone. One person even put their fingers around my wrist and said “ur too skinny”. (Sorry if I'm side tracking haha). So… The real reason I’m typing this entire story is because now I think I have finally realised that something isn't healthy and I might damage my body. This is because recently (4 days ago), I underwent surgery on my tailbone. They removed something and stitched it up. I started to go crazy when the doctor told me I couldn’t exercise for 2 weeks at least. But I was still thinking of ways to stay fit during these 2 weeks. F45 is out of the picture as they are way too intense and I will definitely rip open my stitches (also my sister goes there and she would get really mad if she saw me). All the local gyms are fully booked this entire week ( I checked :(). Therefore, I have started to walk 7/9km everyday (even the day of my surgery) in order to stay fit. Once my family heard about this they got incredibly mad at me, even my GF is starting to get really annoyed that I’m not taking the surgery/recovery seriously (we get in a lot of fights about this). But of course I am, I want to heal as best I can, but I don’t want to get a pit in my stomach in the middle of the night telling me that I’m going to become overweight again if I don’t go for a walk/exercise right now. Just for me it's such a shame as I thought I was finally getting somewhere to my dream body but now all the progress I have worked for is ruined as I can’t train at F45 anymore. Also I definitely project my issues onto others, I live with my twin sister and I get mad at her whenever she doesn't workout/eats too much. 
However, I guess it’s kind of good that I got this surgery because I’m starting to notice these issues/behaviour. If anyone has any experience with what i'm going through, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I  (14F) have such a strange relationship with food, my parents being the  main contributors of this, and I don't know how I can just have a normal  relationship with food now

I just  want to disclaim that I don't have an eating disorder, I just don't  know where else to put it, sorry about that, if anyone wants me to take  this down i will. So I am 14 years old and I have never been overweight  in my life, but I have been borderline overweight a lot of my life. I've  always been at the end of the healthy weight range. Because of this my  parents have both insulted me, commented on my weight, fought with me  about weight, humiliated me, etc. At least 3 sort of jokes or comments  have been made out of it since I was in 3rd grade. You might think this  probably lowered my self-esteem, but it honestly didn't. If anything it  made me more confident. I would hate them so much for this that it made  me feel better about myself. Like I knew that what they would do is  abusive and wrong and because of it I would tell myself, ""You're more  than perfect just the way you"" Over the years every time I eat it has  become something I have to think about way too many times. I avoid  eating in front of my dad except dinner, which I have to, I eat light  portions at dinner, or sometimes I'll eat a lot just to piss them off,  or sometimes I will purposefully eat a lot of food like after having a  meal just to piss off my parents. It's become such a convoluted thing  and I have to think about everything before I eat. Whenever my parents  aren't home I make myself eat junk food even if I don't necessarily want  that food. Cause in my head I think well this is my chance to eat  whatever I want and I can't waste this chance. If I don't eat junk food I  think it's this terrible opportunity I missed and I get mad at myself.  They make me so nervous and everything I eat. Especially in quarantine.  It becomes the most stressful thing and I have to decide if I'm trying  to make them mad or just comply and it just it's all confusing and  stressful. I feel really guilty when I don't eat junk food but I feel  guilty when I do. Another thing I do is I always make sure I have all 3  meals, and you might think well that's a good thing, right. But a lot of  the times I won't even be hungry for lunch but I force myself so my  parents don't think I'm skipping a meal and trying to loose weight. In  my mind my parents seeing me trying to loose weight would be the worst  thing in the world, or seeing me willingly eat healthy foods. 

I'm sorry  I'm being so confusing and inconsistent in this explanation but that's  really how my diet is- confusing and inconsistent. Sometimes when I  crave healthy foods I make sure to eat it when my parents aren't home.  When my friends, family, and people online are talking about how much  they ate in a day or the meals they skip I feel so guilty. On weekdays  my parents don't get back home until lunch time and I either eat tons of  junk food or I skip breakfast and contemplate skipping lunch out of  guilt. I never do end up skipping lunch cause I realize than I'm letting  my parents win. But since quarantine I HAVE gained weight I'm at the  very end of the healthy weight range scale and I feel so shitty because a  lot of what my parents say is now well right.

I went off of it June this year (~5 months ago) and have not had a period since going off of it. I have had an eating disorder in the past. I was badly anorexic for about 5 years (college) where I got down to xxx pounds at 5’9” (underweight bmi range). I am recovered and xxx pounds at 5’9” (normal bmi range)  but no period in sight. I exercise and am very active. I run about 5-7 miles roughly 3 times a week, and ride my horses 3 days a week. I have hashimotos hypothyroiditis and currently am not medicated for it (was for 10 years and went off this year as an experiment because my numbers are not extreme). 

I want my period back so badly because I want to have babies in the next 5-10 years. Here are my questions:

-even though I am recovered, could I have messed myself up for long term with the horrible underweight time in my life with an eating disorder?
-do I have to stop exercising? I am extremely type A and running is my coping for anxiety so I really love it. 
-anyone have similar experiences and something in particular helped you get your period back?
-my Gyno says to give my body some time and if all else fails in a few years and I want to have babies and don’t have my period, there are pills I can take to induce ovulation. Is this something that’s usually successful and I should not worry?

Here are my lab numbers:

Estradiol, serum, MS: 56 pg/mL

Progesterone LCMS, endo sci: &lt;10 ng/dL

LH: 5.3 mlU/mL

FSH: 7.1 mlU/mL",Request: Question how to get my period back post eating disorder?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/jvr9h0/request_question_how_to_get_my_period_back_post/,1605633186,17-11-20 5:13
1181,EDPostRequests,1605611576,jvr9em,"I’m submitting this post because I haven’t been brave enough to admit to anyone in my real life what’s going on, but I think I’m starting to relapse into an eating disorder again.

For background info, I was diagnosed with AN my sophomore year of college 6 years ago. I had experienced symptoms since as young as 10 years old, so it was a pretty big leap to go to therapy and reach recovery. It was one of the best things in my life, so much so that I’m currently getting my Master’s in Clinical Psych to work in the ED field. That being said, I’m very aware that relapse is a real possibility, but I guess I never imagined it would happen to me. 

I started to notice changes in my eating habits when covid hit, and I noticed a small weight loss as a result. I think that’s what started it, as now I’ve noticed that my thoughts are being consumed by my weight and body. 

I guess my issue here is this: I feel stuck. I’m scared to confide in anyone about what’s going on because I’m scared going back to my therapist will make me feel like a failure after all these years. I’m scared people won’t think I’m fit to work in this field if I go back to therapy. I’m scared of going through the traumatic family dynamics that I did years ago when no one in my immediate family cared that I had to get treatment. And most of all, I’m scared of my eating disorder. Life was so difficult when it was really bad, and it took years to recover. I’m hesitant to feel like I’m stuck in that loop.

Any words of encouragement are welcomed. I love this community and I’m dedicating my life to it, and I know how I would support a client or friend if they were experiencing relapse- I just can’t seem to extend the same curtesy to myself right now.

1184,EDPostRequests,1605439174,jukf0l,"Ok, to preface, I don't think I've ever had any big body image issues before, I was a little curvy, but I was healthy and happy. I liked how i looked, people were decently attracted to me. I was fine. 

A few months ago, I was in a relationship situation that I'm still recovering from, I actually made a post on r/relationship_advice about it. Long story short it was manipulative, he's been stalking me and harassing me and it's caused my anxiety and other mental issues to get much worse. 

My anxiety has always had the side affect of making me extremely nauseous and I will usually throw up when i have a panic attack. Over the last several months it has gotten so much worse and now I'm nauseous almost all the time. And I'm worried Ive started associating that nausea with food. At first I wasn't really worried, I thought it was just anxiety over the relationship and what happened and that it would go away as i recovered, but then a specific food i thought I was craving would make me incredibly nauseous, my favourite foods became disgusting. I am hungry and dizzy almost all the time, I have trouble sleeping, im too tired to do anything but lay in bed most of the time. I've dropped weight very dramatically and in a way i know is very unhealthy (I don't know how specific to be but over xx lb in the span of a few months, its very noticeable) 

Its gotten to the point where I get hungry but I know I won't be able to eat anything, if i get up and look at food I might vomit, or if im hungry enough to even cook something usually my hunger just vanishes when its ready to eat. The smell of cooking food disgusts me.

And my family and friends won't stop telling me how healthy and amazing I look now, I've never felt worse. Everything they say is a dagger right in my stomach. Its twists me up inside and the nausea is only getting worse. Now i feel like my weight is the source of my anxiety and not my trauma anymore. 

I don't know what to do. I just want to eat again. Is this a form of ED?

1185,EDPostRequests,1605439102,jukekz,"About me: I'm male, got into fitness in march, lost xx lbs in 4 months and basically went from being overweight to in shape. I've been lifting, doing cardio and IF and, most importantly, counting calories. During the 4 months I've never once slipped and went over my calories for the day because I had a clear goal in mind. I followed a strict meal plan and ate similar meals every single day. After the weight loss I immediately started bulking, still ate relatively clean, still counted calories and saw good results. But after around three months I started noticing some weird eating habits sneaking into my life. I was thinking about food literally all the time, what I'd eat next, when I could eat again, what I was going to eat tomorrow and so on. I didn't see food as food anymore, just numbers and I'd plan out the next day the night before and ate what I put in myfitnesspal BECAUSE I put it in myfitnesspal. If I saw that I had calories/meals left for the day, I'd just eat them right away because ""why not, it doesn't really matter"", even if it meant that I'd be hungry later in the day. I was basically bingeing and justifying it by it fitting in my calorie goal for the day. You can probably imagine that this sometimes lead to actual unplanned binges, where I was hungry and would just gave in to the craving, mainly later in the day or at night. This I justified by being on a bulk, like what's some extra weight gain, this just means that I'll cut again sooner rather than later, whatever. When the weight gain did speed up and I decided that this couldn't go on for longer, I pulled the brake and switched back to cutting mode, which worked for a month until I overate by like xx calories for two days straight, thinking that I can cut it back off in the long run. That was in early October. Since then it's been a few days of cutting around xx calories below TDEE, followed by one or two days of overeating.

I'm basically just maintaining my weight so I'm obviously getting nowhere with this ""approach"" and it's seriously stressing me out how I apparently lost the ability to eat like a normal person. This has been on my mind for quite some time now and I've thought a lot about it so here are some bullet points about my relationship with food, calories and everything else that I observed. 

- I completely lost my feeling for hunger and satiety. I don't even know why I'm eating anymore. Is it because I want to or because I have to in order to reach goal X? The thought process of deciding what and especially how much to eat is deeply intertwined with my knowledge about nutrition and whatever my calorie goal is for that day. This also means that whenever I eat, I ALWAYS finish it because it's already logged in MFP, so I might as well. I also eat very fast, always have, which probably doesn't help with sensing satiety cues. This is why I also prefer few bigger meals as opposed to many smaller ones, because with big meals chances are high that I'll be feeling (physically) full.

- Counting calories heavily taps into a mentality that I've always had when it comes to food and my life in general, which is all or nothing thinking and perfectionism. When I do something, I want to do my best, else I don't even feel like bothering. I want progress and counting calories is unfortunately very easy to obsess about. If I know that I'll have to eat XYZ calories for maximum progress, I'll do that. Everything else equals failure to me or means that I'm standing still and although I know that I can't be perfect, it's still stressing me out and makes my thoughts revolve around food even more. 

- The all or nothing mentality is also why I struggle with moderation. I'd rather eat no chocolate at all than have one piece and be done with it, because chances are that I'll have to finish the whole bar. I get easily addicted to things and if something tastes good, I don't want to stop. I don't think ""I'll have one as a treat and move on"", I think ""I'll have it all and accept the consequences (no progress)""

- Every binge starts with me going over my calorie goal for whatever reason and then thinking ""fuck it, it doesn't matter anyways"". Then, since I apparently forgot how it feels to be done with a meal because I'm actually done and not because an app tells me, I eat until I'm physically full. If I were to eat just a little bit in these cases, I wouldn't be done because I don't know how that feels like, so feeling stuffed is the only surefire way to be actually done. Plus, I already overate so what's an additional 1k calories right? Again, all or nothing thinking.

- Part of bingeing for me is giving in just so that the mental battle stops. I then eat until I'm full and since eating more would be physically impossible, I feel ""free"" from my urges and can move on. It's weird that this didn't develop during my initial cut where I just pushed through. I guess getting in shape made me lose disciple and allowed me to be easier on myself when it comes to food. 

- This one is hard to describe but what I hate about my situation aren't the consequences of my binges. I know that even 10k calories once in a while aren't a big deal in the long run and I'm not scared of some weight gain because some of it will be muscle, which means progress. What I hate is that I'm in this situation at all, I hate that food is omnipresent in my life and constantly on my mind. I'm an overthinker too, so I don't even know how much this is me having a problem and how much it is me just obsessing over it. 

- If I'm distracted or have something to do, all of this is MUCH less of an issue and hours can go by without me thinking about food at all. Unfortunately I have a lot of free time due to covid. 

Final words: Thank you for making it through this wall of text. All I want is for food not to occupy my mind 24/7 and become secondary again. I'm pretty sure that calories and the way I see food is what's causing my binge eating behavior so I guess it'd be best if I would just stop counting. Then again how am I supposed to stop when I'll always know how many calories something has? I don't need the app for that. I can't stop myself from acknowledging that, nor can I just erase all my knowledge. That being said I haven't tried it yet, so maybe I should delete MFP?

So, my problem started developing when I was a young child, (I’m not diagnosed because I have never told anyone about my mental health, but I’m certain this is an eating disorder) basically, my family grew up very very poor, so we rarely had any food in the house. This situation did get better over time and a few years before I was a teen, we had food pretty much all the time. But we were still going through a lot of drama/trauma, and several family deaths. So, i ate. I guess it was comforting thinking “atleast I have food”.  I started gaining and it caused horrible bullying, but I couldn’t stop eating because it gave me comfort. So I started purging. This quickly resulted in my binging severely when I had any kind of stress/ any other kind of emotion that I didn’t like. So I would binge and purge several times in a single day, then I started restricting so I wouldn’t gain, then I got scared that I couldn’t have food so I would binge again and just start the cycle over again. I’m an adult now in my own place, and unfortunately still struggling. Not as badly, but it’s clearly still a problem. Anytime I have even a minor argument with anyone, someone is sick, something going on at my school, something at work, my immediate reaction is binge and purge. Again.

Hello. This is my first post here. I haven't exactly been diagnosed with an ED because I haven't seen my psychiatrist in so long but I can tell that we're heading toward that declaration. I'm supposed to get an ED team soon to pair with my therapy.

With COVID and everything, my family and I had a cozy dinner (just those of us in the house regularly) and my brother dressed for the occasion and that prompted the rest of us, including me, to. I was excited to do so until I actually got into clothes. I usually wear pajamas and sweats and t-shirts around the house but now that I'd put myself in certain silhouettes, I hated myself so much. I feel like I look like a skeleton. My legs are so skinny and so are my arms. At the same time, my body is so disproportionate. For reference, I am shaped like ""P"". It makes no sense. I lose fat everywhere else and I'm terribly underweight but I never lose any of it from my bust. With jeans that show how skinny my lower body is, it's even worse.

Sorry if this is ranty, but needed advice, So I have been in recovery for a few months now after having a flare up when my dad passed away via a cardiac arrest at the start of the year, this made me ultra aware of cholesterol in foods and helped me justify several week long fasts.

I went by referral to a doctor at my lowest point when I stated to feel extremely dizzy ,and was brought to an outpatient ED group, suffice to say , It was nerve racking, as I don’t fit the profile ,6ft used to have a wide shouldered rugby body due to heavy diet for sport, and would have had a lot of boxing friends that would stigmatise Ed’s even if I suspect one or two of having it with their obsessive eating habits that are associated with going down a weight class.

I have attended several sessions now and the people are lovely but Im always asked questions relating to what’s it like being male with an Ed by both patients and the doctors , I’m the only cis man there in a group of 30 or so cis women , I explain the habit came during weight loss for university boxing tournaments and it’s encouraged by my friends ,many of the other members then began to suggest avoiding them and brought up toxic masculinity, but I explained they were a huge support network when my dad passed away and I felt without them my Ed would get worse , but they disagreed saying they were the cause of most of my problems even though I had the problems before I took up the sport.

I feel getting help was hard enough on its own, I don’t look forward to the Ed meetings lately due to the token questions, challenges to my support network, standing out too much in the group etc. am I at fault here and should suck it up ,deal with the questions and take the advice? Or bring up that I don’t won’t to be brought into the discussion? Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation?

 I (20F) am not officially diagnosed, but I acknowledge that I have an unhealthy relationship with food. I spent a lot of time at home since quarantine, and my parents made awful comments about my weight and called me a lot of names. Korean standards are severe. I was a healthy weight, probably considered thin still. At first I started exercising for myself, but it slowly turned into restricting because I wanted the exercise to have more effect, and I did not want to hear the comments anymore. I lost a decent amt of weight before leaving for school - was still a healthy weight. I didn't have to hear the comments, but it started becoming a fear of what they would say when I came back from school. I started mentally counting calories and on an app, and if I knew that I was going out or eating a lot on some days, I would plan for it ahead of time. I didn't have access to a scale, so I didn't know I was losing a lot more. So, when I got home, it both felt really good and horrible to hear my parents saying that I got very thin and to see it on the scale. I know that I should be talking to a therapist, but the school one that is free and one that I wouldn't have to tell my parents about cannot practice on zoom because I don't live in the state I go to school in. My parents believe that only psychotic people go to therapy so telling them is not really an option and they have expressed before how embarrassing it is to see other kids go because it means the parents failed. I have expressed to them before that I absolutely do not appreciate comments about my weight, but they see it as a joke. I have told my bf and some friends, so they are really helpful to talk to, but most of the journey rests on me. Real therapy/help is not really an option until I go back to school in two months, but I do not want to lose more weight and want to be more stable until then. However, I have genuinely no concept of what is enough food, because I thought I was doing better in eating the last month, only to have lost more.

A few years ago, I lost a good amount of weight from tracking calories and lots of exercise. I was eating a healthy amount but I was a bit obsessive about what I was eating, how healthy it was, etc. I have since gained probably half of that weight back and have tried lots of things to lose more weight. 
In the past few weeks, my self esteem has really gone down hill- I am constantly looking at myself in the mirror and being upset, I feel guilty after I eat, and I have a bit of a breakdown almost every day.

Background: I’ve been in and out of disordered patterns for 5 years since tackling a bout of intense restriction in 2013-2015. 

In August- October this year, I committed hard to restricting my eating but binged 1-2 times weekly. I don’t weigh myself but could see myself losing weight at the beginning, but binging increased over time, and my body image  and dysmorphia spiraled to a point I wasn’t even sure what I looked like anymore.

I realized I needed to stop restricting, stop binging, and just eat. In November I began feeding myself 3 times daily no matter what, just to get rid of the anxiety of wondering when I’d eat next and how much. 

I didn’t expect my mental and physical health to improve so much. I didn’t think that my eating patterns and attitude were connected to any other parts of my health and life. Some of the positive side effects include:

-energy! I can and WANT to go on walks, work out, lift heavy things, do household chores etc

-I’m more social! I want to call people on the phone and catch up. Before, I felt exhausted by social interaction 

-trust in my body. Even if it’s not the body that my ED tells me I should have, I feel like my mind and body understand each other and I recognize myself in the mirror

-I enjoy cooking. Before, cooking stressed me the fuck out because I’d be around food for so much longer than if I just grabbed something out of the fridge.

1200,EDPostRequests,1606414093,k1k6gd,"This may seem obvious to some but allow me to explain. For the last two months, my adult daughter has been trying to adhere to a weight-restoration diet as well as seeing a doctor via telehealth once every two weeks in order to treat her anorexia. She seems very unhappy, but she still adheres to her meal-plan for the most part. The days of her appointments, she is supposed to weigh herself, so I’ve reluctantly agreed to let her keep a scale in her bathroom. 

Well, today our scale broke, and I wouldn’t hesitate to buy a new one for the doctor’s measurements if I didn’t feel like my daughter gave me so many reasons to pause. For example, how did she realise the scale was broken on a day she isn’t allowed to weigh herself? Furthermore, when I said I would “wait and see” about buying another one, she started crying, begging me to understand how much she “needs” a scale. She’s also been losing a little bit of weight over the last two weeks, so I’m concerned she’s measuring her weight then compensating for her diet in some way. After all, she admitted a few days ago that she was hoping the target weight set by the doctor would turn out to be an “overestimation”

1201,EDPostRequests,1606389910,k1dmga,"Hello, over quarantine my girlfriend developed an eating disorder. I'm 16. 

While in quarantine her mom suggested that she start a workout routine including daily lifts/runs. While doing these lifts she lost a significant amount of weight. before she started working out she never cared about what she ate, what she drank, or even what she weighed. But when she reached her lowest weight she got upset when she started to gain weight. me as a football player/wrestler know that she is gaining muscle, and not gaining the ""baby fat"" that she had previously to starting her routine. At the moment she fluctuates between gaining and loosing several pounds a week and she only seems happy on the days where she is on the low end. 

I noticed after this that she had a lack of confidence and wasn't as ready to try new things like she used to. she has an apple watch and seems to be obsessed with the circles that count calories burned, and time exercised. her daily calorie intake is extremely low, and she ends up burning much more than that She has a serious history of anxiety and her mom does as well which i assume doesn't help. She is really good at managing her anxiety, because of the therapist that she sees every other month. I ask her to tell her therapist about the trouble she has been having but she refuses, saying that she doesn't trust him because she was forced to trust them at a young age.

 I ask her to try and stay away from the scale but she always ends up on it. because I am a wrestler I sometimes have to cut weight before a meet,and have to stay at that weight consistently throughout the season. I have tried to give her some ways to keep a consistent weight and let her try and follow my diet but she always ends up not eating lunch. i tell her to always eat breakfast to get your metabolism going, but she barely eats breakfast anyway, usually only having a banana. lunch is her worst meal of the day. not only is it at school, but she also has a super low tolerance to dairy of any kind, so that eliminates almost everything off of the school lunch menu, so she has to pack her own lunch. she usually packs it in the morning before school because after eating dinner she is not in the ""head space"" to pack a lunch. she has no trouble eating dinner though, its usually one of the highlights of her day which puzzles me because of how reluctant that she is to eat any other meal. she once told me ""I am hungry from the moment i wake up until l eat dinner."" this to me was a red flag that something seriously needed to be done. at the moment she is toughing it out forcing herself to eat lunch and to eat breakfast, and telling herself that it'll get better. 

I as her boyfriend see her like this and i feel helpless to help her. I know that i will most likely never understand what she is going through, so i don't know what to do to help. i know that i am not a professional when it comes to mental illness or eating disorders, but I want to help as much as i can. there have been times where we have sat down and talked it out, and i feel i can get her to tell her parents and/or therapist eventually, but until then any ""exercises"" or advice to help her would be greatly appreciated.",Request: How can I help my girlfriend,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/k1dmga/request_how_can_i_help_my_girlfriend/,1606411510,26-11-20 5:25

\*Note: It's pretty likely that none of you are therapists so I'm just asking for your opinions as my internet peers. I understand that only a therapist can diagnose me. I am going to make an appointment to talk with my (fucking amazing) therapist about this but in the mean time I'd love the thoughts of internet strangers!

Here's the situation. Over the past two years there have been many months at a time where I have little or no appetite. I either don't feel like eating or i feel incredibly nauseated by the thought of food. I always felt compassionate towards myself whenever this happened and i would make myself eat 2-3 meals per day even if I wasn't hungry.

In the past two-ish months I've been feeling a similar loss of appetite returning. But this time it is being accompanied by negative self talk which is new to me. I'm normally very compassionate with myself but that's been more difficult recently. The combo of negativity and loss of appetite leads me to wait out the hunger till it goes away and skip meals altogether or just snack a little bit. Sometimes I'll skip dinner but then wake up in the a.m. hours feeling so hungry that I have to eat something.

I've noticed that I often feel panicked when I think about making/getting/eating food. I can't decide what I want to eat cause of the stress so I tell myself it's ok to not eat at all. I think the feelings could be stemming from a lack of control due to covid. To test that theory I've tried to flip my point of view to where I understand that by eating healthy meals i am taking control of my life in a good way.

Normally that works for me but it didn't tonight. I did eat a bar, but that was all I could manage (I am also mid blood sugar crash right now which is making it harder to think clearly and make productive choices). Luckily my bf was able to talk me into ordering some food and letting him pay for it. So I have food coming but I'm kind of dreading it getting hear but at the same time I'm kind of excited? I'm feeling super compassionate for myself but the panic, worry, shame, and stubbornness are definitely louder right now so I feel really shitty overall.

1205,EDPostRequests,1606389294,k1dhxd,"Hi there! 

My boyfriend and I recently had a discussion where he and I both talked about how he likely has an eating disorder.  Over the past several months he has dramatically lost weight. The way he explains it to me, him not eating is not a result of him having the desire to lose weight, or him having issues with his body image. He rarely has an appetite, and often loses his appetite quickly in the middle of meals. For example, I made us calzones the other day, and he was trying to reheat a calzone the next day for lunch, and he was having difficulty re-heating it since they were thick, and after microwaving it a few times, he just completely lost his appetite in frustration and couldn’t eat it. He is very clearly frustrated with himself, and he has explained that he feels like he’s dying slowly. I know his lack of nourishment is catching up to him, as I can see he is more fatigued. 

He does eat when we order take-out/we do not prepare the meals ourselves. He says something about cooking/smelling food being cooked/being around food is overwhelming and makes him lose his appetite, but he is able to eat if a meal is just quickly presented to him and we don’t have to deal with it. While this is a temporary solution, we can’t afford to constantly order food, and I personally want to eat healthier/prepare more meals at home. It gets frustrating for me at times, because sometimes I’ll put in effort to cook something from scratch, and he’s just unable to eat it. I know he feels guilty, so I try to not let it get to me, but it is really discouraging because it makes me want to cook less. There have been a few meals I’ve made where he likes them and I feel a bit of success, but he quickly tires of them, and doesn’t have the appetite to eat them often, so I can’t really make repeat meals. There have been other times where I try to make something new, and he doesn’t like it/can’t eat it. Ideally I’d love to have a decent repertoire of recipes to rotate throughout the weeks, but I feel like anything new I make, there’s an 80-90% chance that he won’t eat it/will force himself to eat it but won’t enjoy it. 

I’ve asked him countless times to try to help me by possibly finding recipes he may like to try, or by suggesting things we could buy to have available at the house for him to eat, but he doesn’t know where to start. He doesn’t know what he wants to eat. He has moments where he feels severely hungry and he does want to eat, but he can’t identify what he wants to consume. 

He had a moment today where he broke down because he was starving, and he was so clearly frustrated with himself, and he kept saying over and over again that he didn’t know what to do. He begged me to help him, and he begged for my support, and explained that he desperately wants to put weight back on, and I told him that I am 100% willing to be supportive, and I want him to get better, but he has to tell me what I can do to help. Clearly, me cooking every night doesn’t help, and I financially cannot afford to feed both of us by ordering food every day  (he recently lost his job and I am the only income earner in the household now). I know that he very likely needs help from a medical professional, but he doesn’t have insurance, and he can’t afford professional help now. 

I want to be as supportive as possible, but I really don’t know what I can do at this point to help. It’s gotten to the point where meal times cause a lot of anxiety for me, because I dread how he is going to react to the food. I also cannot see myself sustainably being the only one cooking/preparing meals while also working full time. He has explained to me that he has struggled with appetite throughout his life, and the only time he was able to comfortably eat regularly was when he was in the military and he was able to go to a chow-hall and eat quickly (not having to cook/interact with the food during preparation). I myself have had issues with  restricting my eating/binging in the past, and I am doing much better now, but trying to support him makes my recovery more difficult because I now associate a lot of negativity with meals. 

If anyone here can offer any advice, I am completely open. I really want him to get the nourishment he needs, and I want to be as supportive as possible. I feel like anything I’ve tried is met with failure, and he gets frustrated with me when I try to communicate my frustrations about the situation/ask what I can do to help.

Background on me:
I have ADHD but am not medicated.
I have an anxiety disorder and for that I take 50mg of hydroxyzine nightly. Hydroxyzine is an anti anxiety medication but it is also used to treat nausea.

I do psychedelic drugs.
I’m very underweight.
Gender: male
I’m 5-8
I’m 18 years old.

Heres whats happening:
The idea of eating food gives me a lot of anxiety and it makes me nauseous too so I have to smoke weed to get in every meal. My mom has caught on and shes been trying to get me to eat better but its just making me more anxious about it. I lost weight at college which confused me because I thought I was supposed to gain weight. Although something incredibly new started at college: if I ate food within two hours of going to bed, I would wake up at 6:30am out of nausea and I would end up puking what I had eaten the night before. Unintentionally. Smoking weed first thing when I got up usually prevented this but sometimes it wouldnt kick in fast enough or the respiratory irritation would make me puke anyway since I was already nauseous. I have always been skinny, much of that I attribute to being medicated for ADHD while in critical growing stages when I was younger. I went off meds about a year ago after a life changing acid trip. My anxiety disorder became apparent in February of this year when covid started to get out of hand. Food up until that point has always been something I would eat. I wouldn’t eat enough but it wouldn’t make me feel nauseous the way it does now. And it certainly wouldn’t give me anxiety the way it does now. Additionally sometimes because of my ADHD I legitimately forget to eat meals. My anxiety has spiked since I got home and anxiety and nausea always go hand in hand for me. I am NOT depressed I might add. I’m full of energy and appreciation for life. I do have a really great therapist that i would be willing to consult about this.

I’m terrified. My mom is getting concerned. I don’t know what the hell is happening and no one else seems to know either. Any advice would be appreciated. 

Some things I have tried that either didnt work or I have otherwise given up on:
-Quitting nic (this actually does seem to help with the eating before bed and puking shit somehow but other than that i still have an aversion to food)
-Exercise (I found a love for running when I was at college, but my college is in new orleans where its usually nice out and theres a nice big park to run at. since i got home to rochester, ny its been too cold for me to run and the gyms are closed because of covid. running DOES stimulate my appetite but its not a solution for when I’m at home)

(I've always been weird about who and where my food is made) In middle through highschool I was obsessed with my weight, it started with bulimia, then I began to take multiple drugs around 14 that restrict appetite and was diagnosed with anorexia. Recovery was odd and lonely but by 18 I was eating without even thinking about it. I am now 20, and the average weight for my height, which is more than I have ever been, even when I wasn't restricting. I take hormones for endometriosis that kinda helped with that and honestly there are parts of my body I like now, like my butt. But in all I feel pretty disgusted when I look in the mirror. 

Now where the issue is, I cant stop myself from eating but its VERY specific? Its very hard to explain but im gonna try hard. I seem to almost be addicted to postmates? And not just anything, if im craving something i can't force myself to eat anything else. And if im hunhry and I dont know what to eat I get so frustrated, I spend an hour going through postmates trying to tell myself to just go make myself food but I cant, ill literally cry because I don't wanna spend my money on food i won't even finish and am over paying for and still do it. and when i dont have money for exactly what I want and do try to force myself to eat something else I will become physically sick so instead I just won't eat and its so tiring and I do not know what to do. I dont have much money and what I do have i spend on food. I will buy food i like and stock my fridge and not eat any of it if its not ""right,"".

Tl:DR at the bottom

This is a lot. Sorry if I rambled and you didn’t understand. English isn’t my first language

*CONTEXT* I’ve been surrounded by diet culture basically all my life. My mother is obese and has been yo-yo dieting ever since I can remember. Weight watchers, calorie counting, low carb, Keto, paleo, sugar free, every single diet you can think of. She would goes through periods of pure restriction and then, just goes all out.

Because of this, I’ve been really self aware of my weight and how I look all my life. I was a bit chubby as a kid tho, but then when I was around 11 years old, I began exercising, eating healthier and lost weight, everyone congratulated me. This kept going until I was 13. Basically, I burnt out and stopped caring. But I was always in more on the thinner side

After that, I just kept a similar behavior to my mom. Restricting for a few months, not caring for another months. I developed a pretty damaged relationship with food and exercise.

*But it never got this bad UNTIL:* This year. As always I started this year thinking: I’m going to exercise, lose weight and eat healthy. In this point exercise wasn’t only because of calories, I genuinely enjoyed it. Healthy food made me feel good so it wasn’t All about calories and weight loss.

But quarantine came. I became OBSESSED with food and exercise, once again. Counting every single calorie, exercising two hours everyday. I had SO MUCH FREE TIME. It consumed my life. I was already at a low weight to begin with, but I just kept on losing weight. And obsessing more over everything.

There came i point where I realized, this obsession wasn’t normal. I started to eat more calories, but it still wasn’t enough.

Right now i’m 16. Not losing weight but I’m maintaining. Exercising and, restricting a lot. I eat my 3 meals, but only healthy foods. If it’s not healthy, I worry a lot.

I’m at an unhealthy underweight point. I’m always cold, I’ve lost my period for about 5 months, tons of hair loss, non existent sex drive, dizzy, lethargic, TIRED, cold. Over exercising, over training, sore, in pain.

Food is the only thing I can think about, but I eat.

I want to gain weight, I’m SO TIRED of feeling like this. However, it scares me so much. Everyone sees me as the healthy friend, it’s become my identity and I don’t know what to do anymore.

I like the way healthy food makes me feel, I like how exercise makes me feel but at the end of the day, everything is about calories

Lately, I’ve been on vacation with my parents, so I’ve been more flexible. Challenging more fear foods, eating more calories, but I’m still exercising a lot to try to erase that.

For context, it all started just before quarantine. I (F16) started restricting what I eat and I learned about calorie counting. Stupid me started eating very low calorie, even though it's not as low as some people go. I was extremely obsessed with food. When I went to sleep I thought about what I would eat in the morning, I would even try to count the calories for the next day in my head. In school I was always tired, hungry and cold and I couldn't stop thinking about food. I would spend way too much time at the grocery store comparing labels to get the most low calorie option. I would weight every gram of food I ate. And of course during the quarantine I had alot of free time and I would exercise for 2h per day, sometimes even more. All that went on for about 3 months, I lost some weight and ended up losing my period. I started binging uncontrollably and got my period back. I would find myself in the kitchen, binging on sweets. I started buying large amounts of sweets, for example a bag of cookies, a chocolate bar and a bag of candy and I would eat all of it at once. I would always think to myself ""this is my last binge, I'm getting back on track tomorrow"". But every day I would just wake up and have an extreme need to binge. I binged every day, stopped working out and gained more weight than I had lost. During summer I kind of got back on track, started working out again and tried to eat healthier .

But now I just don't know what to do. It feels like I can't just eat normally. I don't restrict and I don't binge as much as I did before, but it happens sometimes. I overeat almost every day and even the smallest restriction triggers me. I'm addicted to sweets and I need to have some everyday. I am of course worried for my looks because like any teenager I am abit insecure with my body but I am even more worried about my health. I can't imagine all the damage I did to my health with the restrict/binge cycle and with the large amount of sweets I eat every day. I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from restricting what I eat. I wish I could eat like normal people do, in normal portions.

I've only talked about this with one friend but not in too much detail. I don't know if I had or have an eating disorder because sometimes it seems like it wasn't serious enough to be considered as one. Please help me if you know how to rebuild my relationship with food and stop always overeating.

I started feeling a bit more self conscious but I was still eating the way I always did. 

Then two weeks ago I thought I’d try the keto diet. I can’t even remember what prompted it. After a few days of it I got really sick, threw up even (not on purpose), after no carbs or sugar. The next day I said I’d stop and go back to normal, and I thought I would, but from then I just completely lost my appetite. I tried to buy normal food at the supermarket and I didn’t want anything.

Hey guys!

I'm really not sure if this is the place to post this, and I of course mean to offence to any person if this is wrong, but I think I may have an eating disorder/unhealthy relationship with certain foods.

I'm 26 at the moment and I haven't eaten a fruit or vegetable in about 21 years. It's not through choice, I physically cannot bring myself to put either in my mouth. I don't remember when or why I stopped, but my parents told me I choked on something when I was very young and I think psychologically, it's imprinted on me.

I was hoping to maybe see if anyone has had the same experience/relationship with something, and how they dealt with it, or are currently dealing with it.

Again, I don't mean to cause any offence by posting this as I'm not sure you can call what I have a disorder, I just didn't know where else to look.

I’ll totally edit it/ you can edit it if there’s anything insensitive or against the rules::

Im 17 years old, female, 5’2.5ft, and I’ve dropped to under weight over quarantine. Let me preface by saying I don’t have an eating disorder, I know that I am thin and I don’t deliberately eat less.

I’ve always been a very picky eater. There’s very few things that I like, I won’t even drink water. I only drink milk and tea. But recently my pickiness has become even more extreme. I used to only like chicken, now I hate all meat. The texture bothers me and the taste makes me uncomfortable. I find it difficult to eat in the mornings because my stomach hurts all the time. There are days when I skip breakfast and lunch and eat only a little bit of dinner. I just don’t like food very much. I can probably count on both hands the food I actually like.

My parents think I have an Ed, and they say if I lose more weight they’ll take me to the hospital. Which can’t happen because I’m in my senior year of high school.

Unfortunately, there are close to no resources online for people trying to gain weight. Everything is about losing weight. I’ve tried using a calorie tracker but it made me want to eat less. Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can eat more and gain weight back, it’s gotten to the point where every time I stand up I get close to passing out, and I’m so uncomfortably bony.

In my new country of residence, I enjoy the food and I have good friends, so eating with them is generally fine, but there’s one thing I have never been able to do: eat alone. There’s a lot of days that my friends and I don’t have matching schedules to meet for eating, and it’s not always an option to eat at home (I live in a dormitory that’s strict about food in rooms, when you can eat during the day, etc.).

I just have such severe anxiety about eating alone - it’s primarily the thought that people are noticing me eating alone - but I think it’s something I really need to work on, especially if I want to continue healthy eating habits while I live at the place I do. (It might go without saying that once I move out I can finally have food at home again!!)

Main issues I have with eating alone:

1. People noticing me eating alone (to be honest, this is a given since I moved to a fairly homogenous country where I stand out quite obviously)
2. General anxiety about ordering food by myself
3. Getting so anxious that I lose my appetite and then feeling anxious that I barely ate any of the food I ordered (thinking about the chefs noticing I didn’t like the food or something)

(Unfortunately takeout boxes don’t really exist here - you can get take-out if you order it that way at the beginning, but then due to the current pandemic have to leave the restaurant upon ordering it that way.)

Does anyone have any advice about how to go about getting through the anxiety?",Request: Anxiety about eating alone,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/k57g1q/request_anxiety_about_eating_alone/,1606929464,02-12-20 5:17

I don't I currently have a eating disorder but it feels like my eating habits are getting more and more unhealthy and that I might be heading towards an eating disorder soon. I want some advice on how to keep things from getting out of hand. I hope this qualifies for this sub. 

I would like you to post the following:

Hi everyone! Lately my eating habits worsened, meaning I skip meals, and I feel like I'm heading towards an eating disorder. A few years ago I had mono and a depression and I got underweight due to loss of apetite. When I recovered from mono, I found that I didn't want to put the weight back on at all, but I just pretended that I still wasn't hungry because of mono and depression. Eventually I went to see a dietician and she helped me with improving my eating habits and I gained weight until I was at a healthy weight. I was never diagnosed for an eating disorder. For about two years now I've been fine, but the last month I started quitting meals again, mainly dinner. What usually works best for me is having meals with other people, but I work during dinnnertime since two months so having dinner with friends or family can't resolve the issue. I live alone so no one really notices I skip dinner, but I've already lost some weight again (but am still at healthy weight right now) but I'm scared of this thing getting out of hand. What can I do to prevent myself from getting a eating disorder? I will see a professional if I can't work it out on my own, but I want to at least try first.

1239,EDPostRequests,1606907361,k57cm7,"I'm a Journalism major at the University of Colorado currently pursuing a creative thesis on eating disorders and body dysmorphia in contemporary American culture. 

I've personally struggled with food over the years and while I've never been diagnosed, I know how dark and hopeless ED can seem. My sister was hospitalized for anorexia at 12 years old and I've witnessed friends suffer severely. 

The rhetoric around diet culture can be extremely toxic and tends to glorify self-starvation. Therefore, I aim to portray eating concerns authentically and realistically, shedding light on the severity of unhealthy relationships with food through the voices of those that have struggled.

The thesis will consist of photographic portrait series accompanied by interviews. As I know photographs can put people who experience body dissatisfaction in an extremely vulnerable position, I aim to make the photos more conceptual and abstract. 

This would be a collaborative process and I'd work closely with the individual to ensure they feel comfortable and, hopefully, confident. I want to amplify voices and experiences that I believe are often misunderstood. However, I in no way aim to glorify any form of ED, which is why the photographs will be conceptual.

If you're willing and ready to share your story, I'd love to hear from you. No formal commitment is necessary and you can drop out of the process at any point. I'm happy to share more information on the project and participant details upon request.

1242,EDPostRequests,1606907268,k57bzy,"My wife has had ED since high school, many years before we met. She has told me she blames her stepmother, who always berated her for not being underweight and living up to her Asian ideals of body image (I’ve seen her HS photos- she was not overweight at the time). When we met, she was a healthy BMI, but about a year after we met she started gaining and is now overweight.  With the ED she will be fine for weeks and the have an incident of binge and purge. She has recently started seeing a therapist, but it seems that the incidents are now more frequent since she started going. 

She has a high stress job, and since the pandemic I lost my job and so she feels an extra burden of providing for us both (but doesn’t admit it often). I have found part time work and financially we are fine- she’s paid very well and I am able to cover my own expenses and our utilities with what I make- together we are still in the top 20% of household incomes, but she worries a lot about our financial goals being set back. I can’t help but feel guilty but I am doing all I can to find a full time job, I’m already doing all the household chores to try to pull my weight and reduce stress for her. This post isn’t about me but I mention this because she still felt financially insecure when I was working full time, yet she continues now to buy lots of clothes and non-necessities, says we should go on expensive holidays, etc. 

Another stressor is we are trying to start a family but she’s having trouble (I got tested and my counts are high- we think her weight and age are making it more difficult, which she is hard on herself about). I would like it to happen but I’m also fine if it doesn’t. She says she’s the same mindset but I think she wants it more than she admits. All her friends are having kids and on some level she feels left out (I know that’s not a good reason to have kids, but it’s not the only reason for her, just a minor one)

When she has a lapse I don’t judge, shame her or act frustrated- I just clean up her mess without saying anything (if I don’t it doesn’t get cleaned). Then I just ask her if she wants to talk about what’s on her mind, and if she doesn’t (almost never does) I don’t pressure her. It’s hard to remove ourselves from food because cooking and entertaining is one of her legitimate hobbies and most of the time it’s very healthy food and it brings her joy and doesn’t cause an incident. 

I feel like all these factors are out of my control. I can’t undo her past with her mother, I can’t just get a job at will, I can’t make her job less stressful for her, I can’t stop her from cooking which she does as a hobby and a social activity. 

Are there any resources for spouses who want to be more supportive? I just don’t know how to approach this in a way that can help her.

My ED behaviours are at an all time high. I’ve been trying to restrict calories / portions and purge at the same time, drinking a lot more water than I eat, and yet my weight stays the same or goes up.

To cut the story short: I think this girl at my uni I just met this semester (oct 2020) is seriously struggling with an eating disorder, but I don't think i know her well or long enough to do anything. 

So a few things that raised my suspicions 

- starting off with the visual aspects, it is pretty clear that she has a ""low bmi"". she also wears baggy clothes.  

- we study in the medical field, so we had to take each other's blood pressure and hers was exceptionally low 

- I can't really tell you anything about her eating behavior because we're not allowed to eat on campus due to yhe pandemic, but I visited her dorm once (when she insisted on walking there instead of taking the subway) and food-wise there wasn't much to see. Of course this could be an innocent typical college dorm but I don't know honestly 

- likes a lot of ""physical"" posts on social media, being bodies or specific body parts like legs etc. (could be seen as th*nspo?) 

- Lastly, we had a lot of group assignments and we always work together. For our last assignment she didn't really do anything so I asked her if she was okay and she told me she had some personal issues. I told her she could talk to me and she thanked me and told me that she would soon.

My solution so far is to ask my therapist to tell me the difference between weights so I can know that it's averaging in the same place but not the actual number. 

I have therapy on Thursday and nutrition on the 11th. I have to go grocery shopping tomorrow though! I don't know what to do now and I'm stuck. I *should* eat the meal plan but now I'm convinced it's way too much and I'm concerned.

1256,EDPostRequests,1606664674,k3bg63,"Hey there! 

I came to this sub to hear the opinions of people struggling with an ED or who are just generally better informed than I am. I’m not looking for a diagnosis, I’m just concerned about my eating habits. 

So I’ve (20F) been struggling with depression and anxiety practically since my childhood, in recent years I had substance abuse issues and now I will be evaluated for borderline personality disorder too, as I will spend my next 4 months at a psychoterapeutic rehabilitation center in a hospital. 

I’ve always known that I have issues with food, but I always tried to blame it on depression. However in recent months I became aware I might have en ED too. I talked about it to my psychologist a bit, but it wasn’t really a focus subject in my therapy so far. 

The things I’m concerned about:
- I don’t like eating, I try to avoid it until my stomach physically hurts, especially when I have a major depressive episode.
- I lost weight recently. My bodyweight is now going back and forth between “underweight” and “severely underweight”. People in my environment (family, doctors, homeless people I gave my food away to) also made comments about my weight being concerning. I was always quite thin, but from time to time people voice their opinions on my weight and it became more frequent in the past months.
- I cannot drink or take drugs now (I have to be clear for the hospital) and I often find myself starving myself severely to get a high off of it. I like being hunger-dizzy and my thoughts are slow and cloudy when I starve myself. 
- I find my body to look unpleasing, but only in the tummy region. I wouldn’t want to be extremely thin or anything, but I often fantasize about losing more weight and I think my understanding of “extremely thin” is different from the social agreement on it. My bf however likes my body the way it is. 

Why I’m not sure it isn’t just a sort of emotional self-harm or an attachment to my depression: 
- I don’t avoid socializing when it comes to food, I just restrict my eating the same way as if I was eating alone. 
- Eating and my weight aren’t my primary concerns and most of the food I eat are carbs. Sometimes I binge carbs too, but I’m not making myself puke or punish myself after it, just keep on not eating much.

I’ve been struggling with an ED for a few months now, and I know that’s not that long, but it’s truly taken a toll on my mental and physical health in a way I couldn’t even imagine. I’m 17 years old (F), and I don’t have a good support system. None of my family understands me (in fact, they say really triggering things without meaning to) and my friends offer really generic advice (saying things like “you’re beautiful!” and “don’t think that way!”). Although they have good intentions, they have actually made my ED worse, and I just want a support group that understands me and that I can reach out to often. Coming from a household where therapy is seen as only for the mentally insane, I feel like I can’t see professional help for now. I would love to have a group to rely on, but it’s been difficult to find one/search for some that I can join. Although it’s not necessary, I would really like to join one with people in my demographic (teenage girls, I guess?). Also, if anyone has any general advice for me, that would be really helpful. I’m currently struggling a lot with binging and restricting, and I’ve strictly counted calories for about a year now. I’ve completely lost my period for over 6 months, and I’m honestly so scared of gaining weight. I’m a senior in high school right now, so I’m at a really stressful time academically, so my anxiety has been probably the highest it’s ever been in my life. With the holidays, I’ve been struggling a lot with the amount of food around me at all times. Any resources that may help would be appreciated as well.

I definitely have an idea of how I became so hyper-conscious so young, but every time I dissect that and think about what could have been different to prevent it, I end up in a loop.

Different kids will respond individually to different influences in their lives, so there's obviously not going to be a perfect cookie cutter way to handle avoiding it completely.

So I guess I'm curious what everyone's thoughts on this are. What things do you know contributed to your eating disorder?

Just to give context into what I've (24f) been dealing with, a few years ago now I started really suffering with my anxiety which exhibits itself mainly in feeling incredibly nauseous. At it's worst at Uni the anxiety was so bad it made me throw up involuntarily most mornings at like 4am. Waking up feeling like my body was made of acid and then having to run for the bathroom. I was always at the lower end of BMI but the anxiety put me into the unhealthy range. Always hated being thin and the weight loss has made me hate my body so much. I just feel so insubstantial. 
I started seeing a therapist when i got back home and thanks to her the throwing up stopped and I just deal with the nausea now and lack of appetite. 
Now I struggle with eating enough, I get full so quick and the variety of foods I can eat has gone back to when I was a picky eater as a kid. A lot of food just doesn't taste like it used to it's like most of it is cardboard and I feel repulsed by the texture now of a lot of foods I used to eat no problem.
I feel so out of control of my body and I'm desperate to gain weight but it's like my body wont let me get the quantity in that I need - maybe because I'm worried about being sick again because I never want to be back there. 
Most of the time I'm not even hungry and just trying to put food in because I know I need it but then after a few bites I feel so uncomfortably full and in actual pain in my stomach. 

Onto my actual request, last week my therapist noted that my mood has been much lower and I'm really at the point of despair since I'm so worried about my health as a result. 
She offered to contact my doctor (who I am comfortable with) on my behalf and talk her through what I've been going through since she felt it was definitely time to make this step. She called my GP after I said I would really appreciate her stepping in and now my GP is going to call me on Wednesday to have a phone consult. 

Now I'm really anxious about this phone call. I don't know what to expect from it and It's set me even further back I feel worrying about it. I'm really struggling in supermarkets lately trying to buy food and I really beat myself up in my head over not finishing a meal which in turn makes me more anxious and nauseous and low appetite. It's a horrible cycle. 

I just want to know if anyone has any advice on what to expect from this consultation and if there's anything I should do to prepare for it. Any questions I maybe need to ask my Dr.

I am home from 5 weeks in a residential program and doing pretty darn well on my own - haven’t missed any meals or snacks yet! Been home for a week now and Meeting all my exchanges.

My fear is however that I am only EXACTLY meeting my exchanges - so where my dinner is 2 proteins, 2 starches, 2 veggies and 1 fat, I am STRICTLY adhering to exactly that. No oils for cooking, no sauces, no extras like onions etc. For example: 2oz of chicken steamed or baked, 6oz of potato, 1 cup cooked veggies and a Tsp of Butter added at the end. (I do use herbs for seasoning).

I am worried that in residential there may have been a lot more leeway in the meals and that an energy buffer for these is actually accounted for by the dieticians and that I am going to fail to meet my energy requirements even whilst trying to do the right thing. 

Truthfully I wish there had been more visibility around the calorie guidelines so I could meet them, I really could use knowing what kind of calorie density I am looking for in my dinners.

I’m in my first year of grad school and have been going through many stress related issues. One of those issues is an extremely low appetite where I often find myself skipping meals or taking an entire day to eat a sandwich. The appetite issues are just one of many stress symptoms.

I scheduled an appointment with our school counseling center and went through a few screenings to find out what type of care I need. I was surprised out of all the issues I came to talk about, they seemed to focus very heavily on the food issues. Which like I said, in my opinion, is stemming from severe anxiety issues from grad school.

The counseling center has decided my best course of treatment would be to get help from the Emily Program. I had never heard of it, but they apparently specialize in ED treatment and I could do outpatient care in my city.

I’m just really surprised by this and I’m tempted to dismiss it. I truly don’t believe an ED is my problem, although I see how some of my stress symptoms appear this way.

I’m just curious on peoples thoughts. Should I give this a shot? I know fixing the eating problems will reduce the stress in my life, but doesn’t feel like the real problem. Mg appearance hasn’t changed, if anything I’ve gained quite a bit weight because of the weird eating patterns. Or do I need to be more open minded about what an ED looks like?

1282,EDPostRequests,1607510833,k9pr29,"Hi there,

I am wondering what others’ experiences are regarding involving your families in recovery from your disorder. I am no longer a minor and intentionally waited until after turning 18 to tell my family about my ED so they could not force me into treatment. Generally, my relationship with my family very good, and I get along with everyone well individually (though as a whole family things deteriorate quickly and the dynamic becomes unhealthy, so I tend to prefer the 1:1 time). I also talk with my mum and brother about most everything, so I definitely have support and love from my family. However, I am EXTREMELY against involving my family in any treatment for my ED, and hardly even want to discuss it with them. I rely mostly on my boyfriend for support and trust him immensely, he has been my motivation to recover when I couldn’t find it myself and has been with my every step of the way. Even he needs a break sometimes though, and at these times I struggle a bit to maintain recovery-focused habits (I do see a therapist, but I need more consistent support). My boyfriend does not understand why I won’t reach out to my family, and I honestly don’t really understand myself because they have never indicated or acted in any way that is unsupportive. I just tend to get very angry when my parents try to get involved, and anything they try to do to help I do the opposite and end up encouraging the disordered behaviors by opposing their help. 

Long story short, I would like to hear your experience with involving your parents, why you chose to (or not), and how things went for you. I am particularly interested if you have also experienced this kind of intense hatred for their efforts despite knowing they love you. Any tips on how to work through this would also be appreciated.

All of my childhood I’ve been overweight. My parents divorced and after that I just remember food making me very happy. I would always eat, or asked to be taken somewhere to go get more food, and so on. I was always made fun of and it made me so sad bc I just wanted to be happy. After I got molested by my step brother everything got worse. Anyways, when middle school came around,I always made fun of so I just decided to not eating. It didn’t really work, but my friend was doing it with me (she committed suicide earlier this year) so everything just felt okay. I think after about two weeks of not eating I just went crazy one night, then after that, I started to binge and purge.  It felt amazing to finally feel slightly pretty, even if it was just me who noticed. Anyways when I got to high school, I started passing out during marching band, so I couldn’t March. And then I started to fail, so of course I just started to rely on food for my happiness. As I live this journey with you again my mouth is watering for all the foods that were my go to’s. I got back up. Got to the point where my mom was deciding what clothes I should wear bc apparently I couldn’t dress right with my clothes  or something. My mom is one of those fat but hates fat people types and probably was my biggest trigger. Anyways a few years went by and it was always the same. Overeat, Starve, Binge, repeat. When I was a junior in high school, I was finally taken to a psychiatrist. (Which is shitty because I was always talking to counselors and my mom just thought there was nothing wrong with me) I was diagnosed with so much, and one of those things with ADHD. She prescribed me Ritalin and my Life changed. I got down to about 190 before I graduated and my anatomy teacher was the only one to notice. I finally felt I didn’t have to try so hard to be pretty, and I was finally paying attention, and learning. I had also gotten into weed at this point, so the thought of gaining weight didn’t even matter to me bc I was able to fully enjoy food whenever I was high. Everything was great until I had a psychotic break in college and was put on depicote. I swelled all the way back up. Just like a balloon. My partner left me, they took me off Ritalin, and bc there’s an interaction with weed, I couldn’t smoke. And here I was eating not even being able to taste anything through the taste depicote leaves in your mouth. I think that time in my life was my personal hell. After that I was arrested and put on probation for a year. Nothing to do but eat. And get made fun of when I went back to school. When I couldn’t get Ritalin anymore I started taking Aderall, ecstasy, coke, anyways I got down a substantial amount, people noticed, but at that point they were all just fake skinny shells to me. Now I have a very weird relationship with food, I can eat sort of regularly, but it’s always in the back of my mind.I look disgusting. I have no fat in my lower body and look like a lollipop. I hate the way I look even though it’s the smallest I’ve been, I’ve been working out more too and I just can’t get any gains, I’m so ugly and idk what to do anymore. No one understands. I just want to feel accepted or understood. But I just hate it here. I want to go where it feels like home.

For some backstory, I had an eating disorder 4 years ago. I was already slim but I starved myself daily for months until I lost a lot of weight. I ate solid food for the most part once a day, usually a single bowl of porridge. I got cheated on and felt ugly and did this to feel prettier. I never got help for this, I started losing hair and my eye bags got worse and my skin looked tired and would be flaky and just bad and I felt so ugly it made me stop. Just like that. I was tired and weak and hated the feeling of being so fragile and overworked just living day to day so I gave it up. I started eating a lot after that and gained weight within a year or so to became the most heavy I’ve ever been. Since then I have lost weight again.

I talk about eating disorder in the past tense, but today I just heard what body checking is... and I do it daily. Almost daily I set my phone up and video myself. I do a twirl for myself to see how my body looks. If I look skinny and my body looks tight I’ll be in a good mood for that whole day. If my body looks unflattering, bloated or just wobbly and out of shape I will be absolutely miserable instantly and at times take it out on other people.

I had absolutely no idea this was something considered eating disorder related. I’m not starving myself now, I don’t feel guilty if I eat solid food on more than one occasion in a day and make myself throw up like I used to. But I do control my food and what I eat a lot and I do force myself to exercise regularly purely for keeping my body in shape. Since I’m past the starving phase I assumed I was past my eating disorder too. After learning this I am not so sure.

1289,EDPostRequests,1607297129,k84lyi,"Hi, everyone. 

I’ve never been diagnosed with and am not even sure I have a clinical ED, but I have struggled with my body image and weight for most of my life. I have a significant family history of obesity on both sides, including some morbid obesity that lead to conditions that were ultimately fatal. I think that is the biggest source of my problems. I’ve also had significant weight fluctuations due to migraine medications for about a decade so my body just doesn't feel like mine. 

Over the last few years I’ve learned a lot about fat phobia and fat shaming, from how some fat people are treated on commercial flights to how they often face medical discrimination and mistreatment and so much more. I’ve also been tuned into discourse around body acceptance, self love, and body neutrality. 

I feel that, on the surface level, I’ve learned from this and become a better person. I rationally know that it’s okay for people to be fat, to love their bodies, to wear whatever they want no matter their shape or size and I don’t judge people for any of those things. 

However, deep down, I know that my obsession with/anxiety about my own weight, which has always been within the normal range for my height (though I may have been overweight as a preteen), is rooted in that culture of fat phobia which makes me feel guilty. Like, my thoughts about my own body don’t directly impact how I treat other people, but the disconnect between how I treat others and how I treat myself feels wrong. I also feel like I can’t discuss my issues or thoughts with anyone IRL, because people will assume that I hate fat people in general or, worse, that I hate them because they’re fat. It’s also just hard because I’m not diagnosed with an ED so, like, what am I actually complaining about? But, the more I keep it inside, the worse it gets and the more I struggle.

1291,EDPostRequests,1607164063,k758gv,"Hi everybody! So, let me shortly summarize my story: 
After getting diagnosed with fructose and lactose intolerance in february, my eating habits changed immensely. I was suddenly „forced“ to eat much healthier, simply bc my options of unhealthy food became very limited. That way I naturally lost a lot of weight (I was never overweight, just chubby) and the reactions were so positive, suddenly so many guys were into me and everyone told me how beautiful I was. That way, I became kind of addicted to the change I saw in my body. I started working out and began restricting to lose even more weight. When I was at my worst eating habits, I would only eat only one proper meal per day. I was feeling so great and happy at that time. Back then I wasn’t even the tiniest bit aware of that I had developed a serious eating disorder. I thought I was doing everything right and was healthy since my boss didn’t send any negative signals. But then that bubble bursted back in September when suddenly my period stopped completely. My hair started falling out in the beginning of october. That’s when I finally realized what I had done and fell into a deep hole. From then on I forced myself into recovery. At the beginning it was so incredibly hard to eat more again and I was really depressed bc I was so scared to gain weight again. However I’ve been successfully in recovery now for about 1 1/2 months! Since I’ve only been slightly underweight I didn’t gain back that much weight bc I obviously still eat very healthy just much more of that! However, my hair loss is still draining my mental health a lot. My period hasn’t really come back either. I’m still scared to shower bc I lose so much of my hair (been taking supplements and hair growth serums for about 2 months now as well). So my question is:
How long will it take for my body functions to normalize again? Other than that, I feel great again. I also see a lot of new baby hairs growing on my scalp, I just want to know when will the loss stop? Thank you all in advance!

ive never been officially diagnosed, so i’ve never gotten appropriate treatment for my ed. my disordered relationship to food and my body started in middle school, but it wasn’t ever bad enough to warrant intervention. declining dessert (my favorite), and not eating at school. 

i maintained a healthy weight and reasonable food intake up until my freshman year, but home circumstances had changed so id had the privacy to restrict my food intake more than before. it wasnt constant, when my parent got pizza id eat it, when i went over to friends houses they cooked vegetarian meals for me and i ate. i snacked, whatever. friends noticed, but it didnt seem that bad. 

it mostly felt like i was exaggerating the issue, but there was a definite effort to restrict, a good amount of guilt when i couldn’t, and eventually my family started to notice that i was looking thin. i wasnt under weight at that point. 

over the next three years my body image got worse, but my food intake wasn’t raising any red flags. id been put on meds and gained a significant amount of weight in what felt like a short period of time. i wasnt healthy, but i wasnt overweight. it was a big change and its still the most ive ever weighed. i hated it and my body and myself, but any attempts to restrict were short lasting. i tried other methods, unhealthy and healthy (i wont state them out of concern for triggering someone) but those didnt last long either. 

when i turned 18, i left home and made some really bad choices. i was abusing substances pretty casually, and i was definitely trying to harm my body. and after about 6 months a friend messaged me to say that they were worried about me, that i looked unhealthy. at that point i weighed myself and realized that i had been eating just enough to stay awake for a few months. i guess i saw this as my “chance”, and i started consciously restricting again. 

i weighed less than i did in highschool. even after i got sober, i clung to my eating habits harder. it became a bit obsessive, and a big source of panic and depression. towards the end, when i was too tired and angry and weak to do much more than smoke and work part time, i started walking two miles to 7/11 in the middle of the night, spending about 8-12$ on junk food, walking back and then eating all of it in one sitting. i called this a binge, and it was where most of my intake came from. it was scary, and i didnt know how to stop. i wont say a number, but i was very underweight for my age and height. 

well, eventually something happened that opened my eyes, and i decided that i wanted to heal, and i realized that it was up to me to do so. i moved, and i really wanted to be better. i didnt have any eating disorder specific treatment, so i did this on my own. it took me a few months to get to a point where my body wasnt scary to look at. i had to cook for myself with literally no experience, and while it was only one of two meals a day, it was enough to give me my energy back and let me gain at a healthy pace. 

i’ve been at a healthy weight for over 6 months now, and i remember how happy i was when i first made it out of underweight territory. i was proud of myself. i am proud of myself. i did this on my own, and ive grown a lot. but around this fall i noticed the feeling again. i cant name it, but it lives in my solar plexus and it feeds me self doubt and hopelessness and it feels like the opposite of a hunger pang. i acknowledged it and forced myself to take care of myself, but..

ive watched myself gradually revert back to old habits. i work most days, and i dont eat before work. i might snack at work, but most days im not motivated to cook after. (and all of that is an excuse. i really just havent been eating more than every two of three days unless someone cooks for me.) i’ll make so many excuses, and i’ll “binge” on snacks late at night before cooking dinner, then feel unwell and not cook for myself. tonight i got off work, id planned to cook for myself, but i ended up walking to the corner store and getting a ridiculous amount of munchies. i sat down in bed and ate until i felt full, and now its 1am and im not making dinner. i got deja-vu when i realized that ive done this before, and im really starting to get scared that im not okay. 

the decrease in appetite came with an increase in depression, and im not convinced that this isnt all the result of chronic stress levels. im learning to love my body and i want to be healthy, but i still have all of these unhealthy expectations for how i should look, and i dont think i understand what a healthy relationship with food looks like. 

i dont think it was ever 100% about food or my weight, i think it was a way to mask a deeper issue. i always sorta assumed it was a symptom of my bpd. a lot of trauma stuff has been coming to the surface since this started back up... im confused, i never got help and i was doing so well, i dont know if this is a relapse..? or how to handle it. i feel out of control and im scared, i dont feel like i can take care of myself.",Request: is this a relapse?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/k758eb/request_is_this_a_relapse/,1607185653,05-12-20 4:27

I am looking for some insight/ help in regards to my partner 33F, she has suffered with eating disorders for most of her life since puberty I believe.

She has been to treatment of several occasions, regains her psychical health but seems unable to make head way with the mental portions.

It is just a roller coaster of emotion and watching her fall back is heartbreaking and very scary watching the cycle.

I have tried my best to educate myself on how to be the most supportive, understanding the illness. 

Not knowing if she will ever be ""better"" or if that is even possible, or what is consider better. 

I love her so much and it breaks my heart that there seems nothing i do helps.

1300,EDPostRequests,1608203420,kevk89,"Hey there! Due to some mental health issues I have been restricting my food intake drastically. The last 3 months I have usually only eaten 1-2 meals a day and I have lost a lot of weight. 

I have had past episodes of weight loss and being underweight but managed to gain it back. I’ve never sought professional help for it because I never really realized I had a problem, the only problem I thought I had was that I was fat...Anyway, this last weight loss have not been entirely due to my body image issues but also because I have OCD and without going into too much detail it has interfered with my eating habits. 

I am really feeling the physical effects right now, and I’m wondering if this is normal? I feel so dizzy and shaky most of the time. I feel hungry in a weird way. I never really feel full, although my stomach can feel full, but I still feel super hungry after eating. All my muscles just feel really shaky and weak and it takes me a long time to fall asleep even though I’m tired. I just feel so dizzy and weird and it feels like my pulse is racing although it’s fairly normal and it feels like I can’t breathe because I have so little energy. I don’t understand if these things are due to the restrictive food intake or just anxiety or maybe a combination. I’m wondering if this is normal, has anyone experienced anything similar? 

I also don’t feel «thin enough» to be having these physical problems. If I was super skinny then I’d understand why my body would react like this. My BMI is like xx (new the low end of normal range) so I’m technically not even underweight. Well I do get that body don’t like this restriction and it has been going on for a long time, but in my head I’m too fat. I’ve even been eating a bit more these couple of weeks, but I still feel even more dizzy and shaky than ever and it feels like my body can’t take this anymore. I do realize that this is not healthy and I have been through treatment for OCD, but I’m still not able to eat enough and if my OCD related problems were to go away then I’d still be super scared to gain weight so I don’t know what to do. The OCD therapist asked me if I was trying to lose weight and I kind of said no, but now I’m realizing this thing is a bit more complicated....it’s 5 AM and I can’t sleep cause I’m so dizzy and tired. Even though I’m not eating much I don’t feel like I’m losing any weight anymore, which makes me believe that if I start eating like a normal person I’ll definitely gain weight and I just don’t want that....I just don’t know what to do.

1303,EDPostRequests,1608203219,keviqx,"Hi, my friend (23) was overweight all her life and always had body image issues. About 2 years ago she begin to fast and binge a bit. Her weight isn’t anything im worrying about right now since she never lost a significant amount of weight doing this but its still really bad for her health overall. Since 3 month, she fasts more. Now, she always talks to me about, but  its in a ‘’happy’’ way.

 I get that im her bestfriend and she needs to vent, and im 100% supportive of her. The problem is she talks about it like she is almost proud of it. Let me give you an example of a text message she sent me: ‘’Yooooo I didn’t eat for 3 days! Never been this long now my head hurts so bad XDDDDD’’. I know it could be a call for help, but we have been best friends for over 8 years, we are always with eachother and we know evry single thing and thoughts about eachother. I saw her vulnerable in other situations she was in and I know for a fact she talks to me about something when it bothers her (suicide plan, suice tendancy, selfharm…). So I don’t think she would keep something from me and not talk to me about the suffering this gives her. It really doesn’t seem like a problem for her. My point is that she trusts me a lot.

 I know theirs a part of call for help in all this (and you need to suffer for wanting to eat this way)  but she talks about it like she is proud, telling me her eating plans and rarely about the negative impacts it has on her life. I asked her to talk to me about the bad side of this eating disorder but she laughs and say that she doesn’t really care at the moment. I know her real laughs and her fake laughs. This laugh seems like a genuine laugh, and she is a horrible actor, so I know 100% times when she isn’t telling the truth or keeping something from me.

The thing is, Im scared that im encouraging her by tolerating her jokes (we both use black humor as a defense mechanism) and listening to her comments when she seems proud. I think that first, by talking to me about it this way its minimizing the problem and second, it makes the problem less of a burden for her. But knowing her, I sadly think it needs to become a burden before she wants to change it. I told her a 100 times about what the long therm effects it could give her so she is pretty well informed (I study in mental conditions at school). 

What should I do? I thought about asking her to not joke about it with me and for her to only talk to me about the negative impacts this thing has on her (anxiety, if she is scared…) and not on her ‘’succes’’ of fasting and losing weight. What should I do? I strongly push her to have a counselor and I searched online but im absolutely not equipped to deal with this.

1304,EDPostRequests,1608203209,kevio7,"Lately, I've been trying to eat healthier, cook more, and move around some more, but it's made me realize that something's going on with my health around eating. My goal is to gain a small amount of weight because I'm a trans guy, and I'm self conscious because I don't have a lot of muscle. But to do that, I need to eat more, so I started using a calorie counter app this week. I began by eating my usual amount and putting it in the app, and it turns out that I'm not even eating enough to maintain my weight. The worst part is that this is more food than I've been eating on average for almost five years. I picked up eating breakfast again after quarantine started and my parents were watching, but before that, the only thing of substance that I ate through the week was dinner. 

I don't know what's going on. I lack an appetite and have to force myself to eat a reasonable amount, and no one suspects that I'm not eating enough because while I am skinny, I don't look underweight. My doctors say I have a healthy weight and amount of nutrients, but I don't feel like I've been living well. At some point, I stopped eating breakfast, and it just kept escalating to the point that I barely ate lunch. 

I love to cook and I love food and flavors, but I just can't eat. All of my actual eating  (not tasting) is performative. I would make these elaborate lunches that everyone was jealous of, but I'd barely eat any; I'd just eat enough to *look* normal and throw the rest away. This was during the school year when I had to have been at my unhealthiest point. My excuse to myself was that I didn't have enough time to eat, I would say I skipped breakfast because it was too time consuming, and it made me feel sick. And eating does make me feel sick, but I don't even know why. 

I'd be lying if I said there weren't a lot going on. I'm trans and depressed, I'm uncomfortable with my body. And I'm legitimately worried because I know that something isn't right. I want to go to the doctor, but my parents keep stalling, so I'm my mind I'm going back and forth between optimism and hopelessness. Or maybe that hopelessness is realism because in my family, all of this is taboo.

However, it's not because of a body image issue but because  of multiple food sensitivities and allergies, as well as the tendency to restrict carbs when I'm stressed out. And the more I restrict what I eat, the more it hurts to eat. 

Doctors don't know what's wrong with me. It's been 7 years of searching for what's wrong with me, and we still don't know. The only way I've learned to curb the pain is start eating consistently until it goes away. 

However, I recently left a job where my boss was poisoning me with food that I'm allergic to and I'm pretty sure my gut is still healing. It's getting better, but eating still hurts. 

I'm in college now and I'm visibly dropping weight that I can't afford to lose. Thinking about eating is so depressing, but so is looking in the mirror and being so much thinner. I don't feel pretty being this thin. I definitely don't feel healthy, either. If I'm not underweight already, I'm well on my way there. 

The last time I had this, it took having friends support me and tell me to go eat. I had to constantly eat and eat and eat. But now I'm struggling again, and I am now also allergic to soy, which greatly restricts what I CAN eat. 

I need encouragement to keep trying. I wake up and am so happy and cheerful, right up until I realize I have to eat, and then it ruins my morning. I can't even eat first thing in the morning because I get nauseated. It takes a lot of work on eating right again to be able to stomach food first thing in the morning. 

So far, I have bought a protein mix to add to my coffee in the morning, which I start tomorrow. I'm trying to have at least one body armour drink (healthy gatorade) a day. I have fruit snacks, and bubble tea and other high carb light foods that I'm adding to my diet to try to boost my carb intake. These are in addition to what food I can get myself to eat. I'm trying to figure out ways I can add more carbs, fat, and protein to my diet without upsetting my stomach.

Now that her mom knows, she wants to bring her daughters ED up with her doctor. I’m worried it could backfire and all of the pressure on her to gain weight will result in the opposite. I’m hoping the idea of getting her to make some gains in the gym might be the kickstart she needs to improve her self image, but at the same time I don’t think it will make her feel okay with putting on any kind of fat.

Since I was twelve I had issues with eating and body image. It has fluctuated over the years from starving to binging and purging. over the years with the help of therapy, I have greatly improved on these behaviors. I was then diagnosed with celiac disease three years ago. I am very sensitive to gluten and have extreme reactions. This diagnosis has added new dimensions to my eating issues. I have increased anxiety about eating and food.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always had trouble eating in front of others but now since I am often eating a 'special' meal which is different than anyone else, it has made it worse. I hate the feeling of people making comments about my food in regards to it being gluten-free.

Since I live with roommates who do eat gluten I feel a heightened sense of anxiety anytime I am trying to cook in my kitchen. I stress about food for special occasions days or weeks in advance. If I ever find a new gluten-free product (recently gf cannolis), I find myself reverting to binging and purging behaviors because of the feeling of restrictions this diet puts on me. I struggle with the fact that a lot of gluten-free products have higher sugar content than the gluten versions.

**My therapist and psychiatrist are both telling me I need to start exercising regularly again to help with my mood and focus.**  Executive function struggles and anxiety (non ED related) have made it  difficult to follow through on this. I have found that when I feel this  way about other tasks, it is super beneficial to have someone else doing  a similar task with me (or even just being there, whether or not  they're involved) really helps with my motivation and anxiety.

Thus,  I think it could be helpful to have a workout buddy. Of my closest  friends (aka who I would be comfortable pairing up with):

* One  is very supportive of my goals but declined because she is genuinely  not interested in exercising right now so I can't force her \*One is very  active already and is too busy with school to take on the buddy thing
* One is very willing to do it with me and has also been advised by her therapist to exercise more to help with depression. **However, while this same friend is in a healthy mindset with regards to exercise, she also has an ED history.**

I  am trying to figure out a way to healthily have a buddy system without  risking triggering each other. Lots of ""workout buddy"" tips online talk  about working out together and doing the same exercises, doing  challenges, competing for the most reps, etc. But this seems risky given  the competitive nature of many EDs and I don't want to fall into this  trap.

**Does anyone have any advice or ideas for creating a healthy workout buddy plan that stays away from this competition aspect?** Thank you so much in advance!

I don’t necessarily think I’m the “defining reason” for her disordered eating habits but I definitely think my own habits got the ball rolling with her behaviours. 

[story] my sister (18F) and I (24F) have been best friends since I was a child growing up. I’ve had my ED for a looong time. I originally started b/p around that time but realised quickly after that my best plan would be a/n. My sister never had any issues with food during this time and I’ve always done an excellent job at hiding my ED from my friends / family. However in May of this year I went into residential treatment and that’s when everything came out. Everyone in my family suddenly knew about my ED, my habits and my eating patterns. During this time we talked everyday but she mentioned her weight gain a lot to me or would make little comments about it. I frequently would ask her not to bring up anything weight related because it was hard for me. Naturally though, I was worried and frequently pleaded with her not to go down the path I went down. I feel like it fell on deaf ears though. I ended up leaving AMA in October due to an emergency my sister had that resulted in a hospital stay, I realised how she had already been sucked into it and I only realised because I suddenly had nothing but resentment and blinded jealousy for my sister. I wanted nothing more than to have her body in those moments.

I feel so much guilt for even introducing her to this disorder and allowing her to see what my eating patterns were like because I started the ball on her own ED. On top of that, I feel complete and utter *competitiveness* to do “better” than she has. It’s not good for my mental health or hers. I feel so lost, shameful and irritated by what I’ve done. I’ve urged her to get help and go to treatment but it’s the last thing on her mind. I know if she won’t get help then I won’t either because of how competitive I’ve become as well in the last month and a half alone.

I had been asking her for quite some time about things that went on in her life because I could see that it really had a toll on her. But in a sense she always tried her best to hide the illness, ""to live up to my expectations"" and dodged everything. Kept things to her self.

Recently, I just feel so lost and tired of all this. It’s as though I’m being cornered by myself. I don’t really think I actually have an ed, but I definitely have some sort of issue regarding food and food consumption. I recently started to stop counting calories (or at least I’m trying to stop), but now I’m just binging. I’ve been binging for the past two weeks or so, and I’ve gained a little bit of weight. The weight gain isn’t really what’s bothering me, it’s more so the lack of control I feel. When I first started counting calories, it was to lose weight, and then, when I hit my goal, I was satisfied. While I was counting calories, I guess I just started unconsciously restricting (at the time, I had very limited knowledge about eds). Even though I became satisfied with hitting my goal weight, the habit of counting calories never left me. I continued to count and lose weight until I went below my goal. That’s when I decided to stop counting because I realized that any lower would probably become unhealthy; but as a result of no more calorie counting, I’ve lost control.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be able to control the amount of food I ate, but now, my body is almost subconsciously and compulsively grabbing more food. I know that I could stop if I really wanted to, but my body decides not to. This loss of control is what’s been eating away at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m always thinking about eating and trying to fight my urges to consume more. Before going to bed, I’m consistently thinking and planning about what I’m gonna eat tomorrow, and whether or not I should/will restrict. All of this is so exhausting and it causes me to become so unmotivated and unbothered to do things that are actually productive and will benefit me. I have so much work to do, but the thought of food keeps popping up. It takes up everything in my mind and head. It’s as if food has gained more control than I do.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to be able to live my everyday life without constantly stressing about food, and trying to fight and keep myself from continuous eating. Because I’ve been binging, I wanted to restrict and go back to my meticulous calorie counting and meal planning, but I told myself that I wouldn’t fall back into that rabbit hole, as I am satisfied with my weight and there’s no reason or point to go back. I feel guilty for my binging, so my mind automatically decides that I should restrict, but at the same time, I can’t stop binging even though/once my body tells me I’m full.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to be able to eat when I’m truly hungry, and stop when I’m actually satisfied and full. I’m sort of in a position where I am constantly binging and I want to start restricting and dieting again so that I can lose the gained weight, but I know that I shouldn’t restrict, and I am also aware that I no longer possess/have the control to start restricting again.

I was hoping to have something posted on the subreddit as I am currently unsure about the situation that I am in.

I was diagnosed with a structural esophageal disorder (esophageal dysmotility), in which my lower esophageal sphincter doesn't close, so food and drink will occasionally come back up if I don't limit myself to very, very small meals over the course of the day.

The issue is that since developing these symptoms 3 1/2 years ago that I have found myself deliberately utilising this feature in order to overeat, with the knowledge/ expectation that I can more or less mitigate any weight gain by either consuming drinks/ taking steps that sort of irritate my lower esophageal sphincter and induce vomiting. I spent a fair bit of the past 3 years setting aside certain times to go out and purchase food and would always account for the time that I knew it took to bring certain things back up. I would also weigh myself immediately after overeating and throughout the process of bringing things back up as a means of monitoring my progress; if there was not much change in between then I would make myself exercise or would reduce my intake for the next few days.

As a result of some changes to medication I gained weight and was unable to utilise this aspect from May of this year, which has left me feeling a bit rubbish. I have noticed however that I am returning back to this habit and that I am able to lose weight whilst still overindulging on nominated dates, much in the way that I was able to keep my weight in check in the years prior.

To sum it up, I essentially have some sort of distorted eating that occurs as a side effect of anxiety and it's noticeable and concerning enough for me to be seeking advise. Has anyone ever experienced something like this?

I have been in therapy for awhile now and my therapist doesn't seem to be that concerned about it or at least thinks that if we can help my anxiety we can fix my eating patterns. I'm wondering if it's more than that, though. It's something that really bothers me and I'm just trying to find any way that I can break out of this pattern and eat normally.",Request: Question: has anyone ever experienced distorted eating in relation to anxiety?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/kgsjir/request_question_has_anyone_ever_experienced/,1608485211,20-12-20 5:26
1364,EDPostRequests,1608409260,kgfgxp,Hello everyone I have recently left treatment after weight restoring. (I was in treatment for 10 weeks and have been out for a month). I wasn’t prepared for how bad my body image is now. I need someone to tell me that it’s normal to have a giant ring that stick out around my lower stomach. It makes me very self conscious. Will the weight redistribute or will I always have a tire belly?,Request: Feeling self conscious about my body during recovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/kgfgxp/request_feeling_self_conscious_about_my_body/,1608430860,19-12-20 14:21
1365,EDPostRequests,1608409185,kgfg2a," I am 24 and have been bulimic since I was 15, and I suffered from binge eating since I was just a kid. It used to be a massive problem for me. I managed to get out of that and things got a lot better, I started working out, following a healthy diet, I lost weight in a healthy manner and it was so much better that I almost thought I was “out of it”. But then relapses kept happening.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am still on a diet but not an overly restrictive one, just one that keeps me healthy and my habits in check. But recently, it started happening again. I’m throwing up like once a week, and it’s usually not because I overate but simply because I felt like I was cheating on my diet. That causes me to feel the same horrible physical sensations I did once: I don’t even realise I’m feeling guilty, I just feel very sick at my stomach, dizzy, faint, out of focus. I don’t even make the connection at first and I blame it on stress, tiredness, something I ate that maybe was off, my period even, but then I realised it was a pattern, especially because the sickness stops only once I purge.

&amp;#x200B;

I realised I treat it as if it was my “quick fix” if I want a cheat day or if I want to eat something unhealthy and I know it’s wrong but I guess I normalised it to the extent that I just resort to it automatically.

&amp;#x200B;

This is starting to really concern me, firstly because I’m terrified of getting caught up in that again and ending up the way I was before, secondly because I actually have hernia at my stomach and I am very scared of how I may be making that worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Every advice on how to fix this would be really appreciated... I stopped going to therapy after years because my therapist said I was fine, and I’ve been told to stop taking meds as well (not my decision but my therapist’s) so I don’t wanna go back to it again.

I also ran into tumblr thinspo which definitely made me exposed to things I shouldn't have been exposed to. I idolised people with skeleton like body's and compared myself to them constantly...

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't eat anything without thinking of the calories and feeling like a fat fuck and at school my slightly skinny-er friend wouldn't eat lunch, or, at least, very little. And eating next to her I felt even fatter and tried my hardest to eat less then her. (she took like two bites of her food at lunch). One day I ate all my lunch and felt so bad I went to the bathroom to puke it up.

&amp;#x200B;

That was a while ago and since quarantine, I haven't really had an appetite at all, just too lazy to eat. If I was hungry id go to the fridge, but everything was unappetizing and made me wanna throw up? So I just didn't eat a lot in that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I've been going to school more regularly those habits stuck and I don't really eat a lot and I have no sense of what's the right amount of food to eat in a day. Anything sounds like too much, after I eat it's always too much and I feel like throwing all of it up. When I'm hungry nothing looks appetizing, it all looks disgusting. When I take a single bite I'm full. I feel dizzy a lot and I question why because I feel like I've already ate too much for a day. I feel so fucking guilty if I eat ""too much"" in a day but I don't even know if it's too much or too less or if I'm just insane.

Their description sounded similar to my life so I went on Google and did some research on that as well as selective eating disorder. It sounds fucked up but when I learned about selective eating disorder I felt relieved and happy because I have always just been ashamed of my very severely “picky” eating habits. I finally felt heard and hopeful that maybe I can eventually become a normal eater.

I told my doctor hey I think I have this, so can you refer me to somewhere that will officially diagnose me and then help me with the treatment plan? And she looked at me like I was insane. To her credit, she simply asked why I thought I had it and then said she would have her assistant find somewhere for me... but she still gave me a look like why are you making this up, you’ve never said anything about this before and your weight and everything is normal.

Fast forward a few weeks and the assistant sends me the numbers to a couple general therapy places. Even though I don’t want that, I gave them a call and they said they didn’t have openings for months into next year. Fine. I get back to her and ask if I can do an outpatient program somewhere because I don’t think therapy will help as much as having someone qualified with eating disorders making a plan and working with me. No response for several weeks now.

(INFO: yes I could do research and find somewhere on my own but it is such a hassle to find places your insurance will accept. I thought it would be easier for the doctors office to do it since they probably have a list of places like that just in case any patient needs to go, and they already have my insurance information so they could just shoot me a list of places they recommended that take my insurance.

When engaging in behaviours (which I did many times a day) I ate as much as I could and of very excessive food types. 

Regardless, I was very underweight. Which is atypical for bulimia.

For some context I grew up with a mom who has disordered eating (which I didn’t even know until a few days ago but have since realized it’s influenced my eating a ton.) I also went through some pretty rough verbal abuse from my coaches when I did elite gymnastics ages 8-14. While doing gymnastics I ate a lot of food everyday and was praised for eating a lot which has skewed my perception of feeling full because now I’m conditioned to think overeating is healthy and necessary. These things are the biggest issues from my childhood that affect my eating. 
I am not sure if I have an eating disorder because most days I have half of the “healthy” amount of calories I should have for my height and weight, but other days I binge and have triple the amount of “healthy” calories. When I binge I feel really depressed and anxious and just completely out of control and I hate myself afterwards. I try to throw up and I really wish I could, but I literally can’t do it no matter how hard I try, which makes me feel worse.

I need advice for myself and my roommate. I will call my roommate Nancy.

&amp;#x200B;

Nancy is a recent graduate from an ivy league college. At the school, students were pushed to their limits, often at the expense of their mental and physical health. Nancy was hospitalized during her sophomore year because of an eating disorder. In May 2020 Nancy graduated with a 4.0, but because of the pandemic, found themselves in an unfulfilling job. After graduation, i moved in to an apartment with Nancy. Nancy always ate smaller portions of food and would not let anyone else serve them food. During thanksgiving, I served Nancy food and they got angry. Nancy puts everything into a food tracker app in her phone. One time i gave Nancy a single raisin that i did not want and they immediately put it into the tracking app. Nancy also weighs herself after each meal with a personal scale in her room. I only learned about the scale recently. Nancy stopped going to therapy in mid May because it was too expensive. I provided Nancy with free options since she was unemployed at the time, but Nancy said it was too much effort. Since then, Nancy has health insurance that will pay for 100% of her therapy but still refuses to go. Nancy says she is over their eating disorder. Nancy runs 15-20 miles per day, works out for 45 minutes a day, and sometimes adds a 5-10 mile bike ride. Nancy tracks all this exercise that compares their workouts to their facebook friends. Nancy bought a fitness watch to track their every step with money they do not have. Nancy says her stomach always hurts and they are constantly tired.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, Nancy signed up for a paid ""fitness"" program that is designed to make her run faster and farther. In this program they meal prep each week and have to weigh out their food to the exact amount. Nancy is also given specific workout videos that they do 2-3 times per day. This is all I know about the program but im sure there is more.

&amp;#x200B;

The advice I have tried talking with Nancy about how this fitness program is probably not healthy for them. Nancy got mad because I was not respecting their independent judgement on how to deal with their body. The house has become pretty toxic, Nancy only talks about their eating and workout program.

I have always been thin but ate a good amount of food, my parents always made sure I ate nutritious food and I wasn’t really allowed to eat often at fast food places.

When I got to college I tried to eat well but slowly got addicted to sugar and I hated all the fatty foods they had but there were no other options so in an attempt to eat healthier I would try to eat less but it somehow morphed over the years. I am now graduated, I almost only eat sugary foods like cookies but feel awful about it and feel sick afterwards. Convincing myself to make real food is a fight. To counter this I don’t eat a lot of the sugary food and eat like a boiled egg in the morning or a spoonful of peanut butter. I try to convince myself to cook good nutritious food and buy all the ingredients but can’t convince myself to do it after work. I order a pizza or Chinese takeout and eat some of that and then ice cream or chocolate. I weigh like xxlbs and I’m a 5’2” 25 year old (underweight BMI) engineer.

It’s not really a conscious thing... idk why I’m doing this or how to stop.

Context: I'm a 25 year old female, I'm 5'2. I live with my parents as I have stage 5 CKD and I'm going to school. 

TRIGGER WARNING: WEIGHT MENTION IN FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH FOR CONTEXT. 

Currently don't know my weight, as I was in California for some personal matters, and when I came back, my scale was gone. My mom threw it away, because ""it was broken,"" deep down I don't believe that. Knowing my body, I'm 100lbs+, but I have always been 98lbs or less. 

Since I was little I have been skinny and I would say naturally skinny, because I didn't starve myself or purge, I just ate small portions, which my mom says I always have, since I was a baby, due to having a cleft lip and palate. Also, I do genuinely forget to eat, as I don't get headaches, nor does my stomach grumble. Family and friends do remind me to eat if they notice I have forgotten to eat, they have also brought up concerns about my weight and health--mostly health. 

My weight was never a concern, until I was an adult and my doctors started asking me if I was purposely losing weight--yes and no--I was on Atomoxetine which suppressed my appetite even more, but was not working for my ADHD, so I didn't want to switch to another medication, if a side effect was 'weight gain,' as in the past I had to take steroids for another condition and it caused me to gain weight, which I hated. I don't know if I hated gaining weight, because I have always been skinny or what. I have never compared myself to others, but when I looked in the mirror, fat was not in the ""right"" places. I'm obsessed with my cheekbones, collar bones, ribs and hip bones. 

I have had it in the back of my mind, because over quarantine I have been eating a lot, I have this hunger that I could not control, so I went to the doctor and turns out my thyroid was acting up, but she mentioned that Ritalin--medication for my ADHD--sometimes makes patients gain weight--first I have heard of this.  During that same office visit, they gave me my after visit summary as usually and I noticed my BMI and my heart sank, so I email my psychiatrist and I told him what she said and me not feeling comfortable with my BMI, he tells me ""that is not true and does not know why she would tell me that, but that we can further discuss on our next visit,"" which we didn't. Now, I'm uncomfortable taking Ritalin, because in the back of my mind, I'm like ""what if my psychiatrist is lying to me, what if he wants me to gain weight?"" Obviously no one can diagnose me except a medical professional, but I don't want to talk to my provider in depth, because I want to change my medication to another stimulant, without him considering taking me off them completely. 

I'm not starving myself, I'm just going back to my normal diet.

I have been reading medical articles, the DSM-V, and your posts to further understand eating disorders. According to the DSM-V, I don't meet the criteria. 

So, my dilemma, are my habits, bad habits or eating disorder habits? Are laxatives considered purging? I have read they are, if abused, which I don't. 

A post mention their eyes turned black due to Anorexia, my eyes have always been black. My hair is fine, just a little dry, because I have curly hair and I am still learning to care for it properly. I'm always cold, my hands and feet are always purple, so I wear sweaters and boots all the time, but I have hyperthyroidism. 

Idk, I'm just confuse. I don't think I have an disorder, because I don't starve or purge.

I have been purging for a few months now (without binging). Every time I eat something, (unless my mind deems it ""healthy"") I get the urge to purge it, especially when I get that full feeling. I've spoken with my therapist about it and her solution was to write down 3 things that I love about myself every day. It hasn't helped. I go back next week.

I am just too terrified of gaining weight. I was overweight a couple years ago and am at a healthy weight now. I am happy with my body as it is, I just do not want to get back to how I was so every time I eat junk food (which has been often lately) I figure it won't make me gain weight if I purge it.

I need to stop. My gums are starting to bleed and hurt. How do I stop? What can I do? Telling myself what I love about myself doesn't help bc the issue isn't that I don't love myself, it's that I love myself the way I am and I don't want to gain weight due to eating junk. I really don't eat as unhealthily as I used to, though. I don't drink pop anymore, don't eat fast food, only eat out once a week, but I know I don't eat as many fruits and vegetables as I should. I lost weight by basically starving myself and counting calories and being overly restrictive. I don't want to have to go back to that.

1384,EDPostRequests,1609377028,knfged,"As background, I am currently 25 (f) and I’ve always had a relatively unhealthy relationship with food and frequently have done very restrictive diets for short periods of time then gained weight back and repeated this cycle starting from when I was around 12. After college I gained more weight and I was never super overweight but just on the thicker side- like at the max weight for a “healthy” BMI. This year I decided I wanted to get back in shape and started dieting in Jan. It was up and down until May when a flip switched and I really committed to it. First I started restricting my eating which I was used to, then I started running ~6 miles per day 5 times a week, and then I eventually started purging about 1-2 times a week. I was the thinnest I’d been in my life and I met my current boyfriend during this period. Fast forward to now and I’ve relaxed more with food intake but I’ve gained about 7 pounds over the holidays and haven’t been exercising regularly since October so my muscle has gone. My boyfriend is in great shape and just values a healthy lifestyle overall which makes me feel like he expects me to be skinny and in shape. Especially since I met him when I was thinner, I can’t help but feel like he must not be as attracted to me now and I’m really letting it get into my head and it’s affecting how I act towards him because I’m always feeling down about it now. He has never said anything to make me think like this and tells me I’m beautiful but all his ex girlfriends were very thin and I see him liking girls pictures with perfect bodies so it gets in my head that my body isn’t good enough for him. I’ve been starting to obsess over my weight again this week and have started to restrict eating and start running again. I was wondering if anyone has had this kind of experience and what did you do to regain confidence without going back down that path? I don’t know whether to let him know how I’m feeling but I’m terrified if I bring it up he would say something to confirm what I’ve been thinking in my head and make things even worse.

1385,EDPostRequests,1609377018,knfga8,"Hi friends. Long time lurker, first time poster looking for guidance. I’ve had a journey with disordered eating so I’ll stick to the highlights:

I did ballet and dance growing up. That’s when I learned about calories and went through a restrictive phase. My dance teacher was *amazing* and had a guest speaker who taught us about eating and being healthy and that helped for a bit.

Flash forward! Grad school was tough. My dad died and I stopped caring about what I looked like...But then I did! I started running without tracking food and it was fine. Then I downloaded My Fitness Pal to shave off the extra pounds. We all know that game. 

Then I started CrossFit after meeting my now ex. That wasn’t the problem I still do CrossFit. The problem was that one I told him I felt fat. So he hired someone to do my macros. So then I started to lose the weight. I got compliments, my numbers on metcons and strength went up. I felt great. 

Then we broke up. Again, long story short I finally had control over ALL my meals. Not his food and going out on dates, etc. I lost a significant amount of weight, lost my period, even had blood tests because doctors were worried about the rapid weight loss. I didn’t care or didn’t believe it.

Now my family is concerned. But it’s hard because people who didn’t know me call me “disciplined” and think I look good. But my family knows me and knows this isn’t me. I think I have orthorexia because I track my macros to the gram. I cut out dairy last year and now I’m vegan. I also do intermittent fasting because why not. I weigh myself everyday and get sad when it’s not a number I want. I need to get my calories in and hate when they’re off. 

I don’t like myself. But I can’t stop. I’m always tracking, always thinking of the protein, fat, carbs in a food. I didn’t enjoy Christmas and I’m scared. I want my period back! 

How do I start getting help? Do I need help or am I being dramatic? I can still lift heavy weights and do hard workouts and for the most part look normal, but tiny. 

I’m in denial but I’ve had more than one intervention with my family who is concerned but I think that’s normal since I’m the youngest and they care?

I would have a coffee and maybe a meal, but usually just the equivalent of a pack of chips. A lot of what surrounded this was control, and what aided it was my never feeling hungry.

I just moved into an apartment with my partner and have been doing a lot better. He has been cooking for me, and I have been hungry again. This week of holiday meals was full of food. 

Family/my partner has mentioned how much healthier I look, saying I have filled out, look fuller in a healthy sense. Nothing bad. I told them I was stuffed and could not possibly eat all the food they put on my plate (they know about my past eating issues.) We do not have a scale at home, but I have noticed my weight has gone up and my dad's scale confirmed it. 

I hate it. I hate feeling hungry. I hate eating full meals again. My jeans are tighter and it is a horrible reminder for me. I hate looking in the mirror and seeing myself. I want to go back to not feeling hungry.

I have been to therapy before, it worked in other aspects of my life, but not with food. I want to find a good health app that does not count calories so I do not track that.

I had an idea to start a “business” selling special scales. These scales would have you enter your height, age, and sex. After that, rather than displaying your weight, it simply tells you if you are a healthy weight. If a healthy weight is not registered, it displays encouraging messages and tips on how to get back to healthy weight.

I put quotations around “business” because I want all proceeds to go to an ED charity such as NEDA.

Would this help at all? I don’t want to pursue this idea if the people it is intended to help are against it.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been with my girlfriend for 8 months now and we love each other very much, but early on into talking she made it clear that he’s has mental issues and has fought with her ED for over a couple years now. She went through a massive weight change since over a year ago and has lost a lot of pounds but i’d rather not mention anything because I don’t want it to be triggering to anyone here.

&amp;#x200B;

She was obsessed with working out, counting calories, and losing weight in an unhealthy way and some days today can be worse than others. Sometimes she just doesn’t want to eat at all, some she worries about the repercussions, some days she seems fine and will enjoy her meals with me when we go out but i’m assuming those thoughts are still in her head. I just don’t want to push her into doing anything she doesn’t and thankfully she’s very comfortable with telling me about it.

&amp;#x200B;

At times, she’ll have bad days. A few days at a time where the voice is constantly in her head. She’s more than a body and she’s beautiful inside and out no matter what as i keep reminding her, and I know she knows that her body isn’t different to what she may be thinking in the moment, or that i would judge her which i’d never. I just want to know if there are any other things I could tell her at times when it’s bad or randomly to make her feel better. I try my best to console her and it works a lot of the time but I just want whats best. Thank you guys for everything.

My title is : I hate myself. I have had enough of bulimia. Im scared I dont know what to do anymore. I need advice. 

Body : A little backstory about me and my condition. I started bulimia when i was 14 years old. I was a chubby kid, and i played basketball and my biggest issue was my weight, so I figured if I become bulimic i could get in shape and take my game to the next level, it worked. I was bulimic til I was 17 and it felt good, i had a-lot of attention from girls, i looked good, i felt good about it and i thought it was okay. But one day I looked at my teeth and I realized the damage that started to occur so I quit purging for 2 years, i had pearly whites and they were very yellow and started coroding. So i stopped for 2 years, it was tough, i went from 200lbs and in shape to being 260lbs and obese. I had everyone telling me basically how bad i looked at whether it was my friends, my doctor my family it was horrible but i fought threw it those 2 years. When i was 19 I started dating a very pretty girl that indirectly made me feel  so insecure about myself. So much so while  dating her i figured i have to become bulimic so i can look good for her and make her physically attracted to me and to be confident in myself, so it started. 

Throughout college i was bulimic and it got so bad at points that i would purge and have nothing in my system then drink and almost kill myself accidently from alcohol poisoning i started to feel random pains in my body and all that, my teeth are coroded to the point the bottoms of my teeth arent straight anymore they are uneven and i even had my tooth chip because they were so weak and i bit down on them too hard. I got told by a doctor when i have a fatty liver but never went back because i was scared to find out more. Anyways i had some very personal things happen to me that out me in a really bad spot, i started purging alot more to the point i wouldnt even let food digest i would instantly go to the bathroom and make myself throw up. I dropped from 230lbs to 185lbs i did catch covid aswell which may have contirbuted to a small part of my weight loss but nothing significant. I dont play sports havent for 4 years therefore even though i have lost alot of weight my body i am now  skinny fat which is even worse because atleast before i was pretty strong now i feel weak. I have been thinking of recovery for a couple years now but I am not ready for that weight gain. I am 24 and i feel like I have completely ruined my life and any chance of future happiness or confidence with myself. What doesnt help is im from a low class neighborhood some would consider the “hood” and the hyper masculinity in it doesnt help as if you ever talk about mental illness or an eating disorder people will look at you crazy and even gossip about you which is bad because i have no where to escape to about it 

So i had attempted 2 times to reach out to a doctor for help, and the response they would get is instant confusion as to me being bulimic almost as if i dont sort the criteria of what a bulimic looks like( i know there is no way there supposed to look but others ovbiously dont) which really had not helped my situation. I also have dont have friends who could help because i dont feel comfortable letting them know because i had gotten scarred when i told my ex and she left, i thought i could trust her with the world and she did me wrong when i let her know whats going on with me. I therefore dont have the coursge to go to a friend. 

I rambled a little but, My question to you guys is what should i do to recover? I cant stress enough how I really do not want to gain weight, in fact I am terrified about it! I know weight gain is normal but i know my weight gain will be very extreme and im not ready for that at all, i dont think i ever will be. Its hard knowing we live in such a superficial world where looks are everything, and the fact that i get alot of attention from women now and treated because my face has slimmed down and the rest of my body really doesn’t help. I want to get my life back together but i cant deal witht his weight gain that will happen i know myself im not okay with it. I tried researching online and a lot of the support groups or advice is aimed at women and not so much men which is good that somethings being done but its hard to even find someone that can relate to me or give me advice on recovery.

But since I have some weird things going on and haven't found anything similar, I thought I'd make a post and see if anyone could help, because I really really hope someone out there has relevant experiences.

**My situation:**

About 7 weeks ago I began having extreme symptoms of nausea and weakness. In a day or two of that I realised I'd been accidentally under-eating (and was therefore underweight) for at least the past two years. To be clear, I didn't have the mental side of anorexia, it apparently just happened that I under-ate for an extended period of time. I then got in touch with a dietician and we set up a plan to increase my food intake, and over the past 6.5 weeks I'm now nearing my target weight.

The problem is that my symptoms of nausea and extreme weakness (like I can barely get off the couch) haven't gone away in the slightest. I've also had a high heart rate, night sweats, chills, extreme trouble sleeping, and hot flashes. I had gastroparesis and GERD, but in general haven't had many stomach pains; really the main issue is this **simply debilitating level of nausea and weakness to the point where it's hard to talk** -- it's of course affecting my ability to get the required amount of food. Also, I cannot eat fast enough to have separate meals. My whole day just ends up being one long meal. Doctors have suggested that some of my symptoms match those of POTS, or maybe inappropriate sinus tachycardia. I'm going to be getting a tilt table test done soon to further investigate that. I've also had other tests done to see if something else may be going on -- nothing has come up yet but doctors say there is clearly some degree of inflammation (whether that's due to chronic sleep deprivation or something else is unclear right now).

My main concern is whether I should really expect this level of continued nausea and weakness at this point in the recovery. I read about people being able to do dishes and go for a walk at this point in the recovery process, but I'm just not anywhere near that yet and that's kind of freaking me out. I had a couple of really good days 2 weeks ago, but now I feel like I did at the beginning of this all. 

Has anyone else experienced similar stuff? I'm going to doctors and dieticians and all so they'll hopefully figure it out, but I really am just wondering **if anyone out there has had similar experiences**.

I’m not sure if I am overthinking this or not. I have advertised a room in my home to sublet. An acquaintance reached out to me and said she would be interested. I like her and we get along well, she’d be a great housemate. I am aware (she told me a few years back) that she has struggled with anorexia. I know she moved locations to access proper help in an inpatient program. My current partner is struggling with disordered eating and has done untreated for ~8 years. 

My partner formally reached out for help in mid 2020 but they really let her down... essentially she was too complex for some of their early interventions and then she went through multiple assessments for another intervention and they said she was ineligible and didn’t offer any further referrals (this crushed her as seeking help was so difficult for her). This happened over a period of approx two months and it worsened her AOD issues and she had to move back to her family home (who aren’t fully aware of her issues). 
She has recently started self harming again as well, and is highly resistant to seeking help. I don’t push her on this but I do try to gently encourage her... 

Anyway, my question is - is this a good housemate option? I am thinking of two of these people I care about. I don’t want to place my friend in the position of being triggered if she picks up on my partner’s disordered eating (who will stay here on occasion). Am I overthinking this?

I skip breakfast nearly every day unless my parents make me something, and I can often go until dinner before eating if they don’t remind me. I usually won’t eat anything unless it sounds particularly good, even if I’m hungry. My diet is pretty shit. It’s not unlikely that my lunch consists of a handful of hot cheetos and half a glass of water. Sometimes I won’t eat when I’m hungry just because I don’t feel like getting out of bed. 

I’m not depressed, though.

On the other hand, it’s not uncommon for me to stay up late only to get hungry enough to eat twice my dinner’s worth (I get full very easily). However, I do guilt myself out of eating late at night half the time, because I know I CAN wait until the next day to eat, and because it’s not socially acceptable to have a meal so late.

Well on this one occasion it has turned put that there was a major error caused by a guy on nights and noone on nights or day shift had picked up on it and because it was such a major issue it caused us to have around 45-50 errors that I needed to investigate in an 8 hour shift whilst also trying to do my normal duties as well.

the sudden and drastic increase in work caused me a lot of stress as i could not keep up there was more errors coming out quicker than I could fix them.

Even when I was going to therapy, I didn’t talk about it so I didn’t get any treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been struggling to eat lately and feeling like such shit because I keep gaining weight. I started listening to the fck it diet podcast a few months ago and it always makes me feel better, and I always learn something new about my body and disorder. I finally bought the book (The Fck It Diet) and started journaling with the prompts, as well as finally getting therapy (and actually talking about it!) and it has helped me so much!!

&amp;#x200B;

Last Halloween I wanted candy, so I bought some. For the first week or so I felt like I couldn’t stop eating it, it’s all I wanted! But I just allowed myself to eat it and I still have some left in the freezer that I just don’t want. This has happened over and over with other “off limit” foods. I eat as much as I want and then the craving goes away. I don’t feel frantic or like I need to binge anymore (although sometimes it happens when I’m stressed/overwhelmed). I just try to be gentle with myself and enjoy eating.

&amp;#x200B;

It isn’t intuitive eating, it’s unrestricted eating with a focus on neutralizing food and getting our bodies out of starvation mode. It’s still scary, I still struggle with feeling guilty and being afraid to gain weight. But refocusing on giving my body and mind what it needs has been so refreshing.

1425,EDPostRequests,1609713859,kpuxya,"I’ve been skinny for my entire life, I remember as a kid the doctor prescribed me what my mom would call “hungry pills” that i would take to increase appetite and shoot my weight up. My mom says she must have blocked out the memory, but I think she’s embarrassed or hiding the truth because I took those “hungry pills” daily for years and I never really knew what they were or specifically why I had to take them. She says it never happened but that’s not something I’d make up. Every day I went downstairs to take a vitamin gummy and a “hungry pill”, thats how it was. I stopped taking them before middle school.

Fast forward 10 years, I’m 18 and athletic but still skinny. I played basketball and football all through high school. Never underweight, but pretty close to that line on the BMI index. It seemed like no matter what I ate or how much I worked out, I stayed the same weight. I also grew from 5’5 to 6 foot in 4 years without adding any weight, and thats when my family started making comments about me being skinny. My muscle composition totally changed, I’m a long stronger now but the weight never increased. I stayed about the same all through high school.

Heres where the juicy part comes in

I’m 19 now and I’ve been getting sick. Not just upset stomach for a couple days sick, it’s a “live by the toilet or I’m puking on the ground” sick. I’ll drink water because if I don’t I’ll get dehydrated and have to go to the hospital for an IV. I can only keep water down for a few minutes before my stomach decides it needs to empty everything and keep puking until my sides cramp. It’s happened 3 times in the past year. 4-7 days of puking where I couldn’t eat anything at all. Towards the end I could have crackers or salted popcorn but my appetite really has to build up back to normal for 2 weeks. 

These sick bouts are making everybody in my life scared and are making me physically change. I know this sub isn’t supposed to use specific numbers, so I dropped from a barely healthy weight to an unhealthy weight. Gaining it back is really hard. I can’t just shoot up weight all at once, but it feels like every time I start making a difference I get sick again and lose all my progress and then I can’t eat normally for a couple weeks after being sick because my stomach has shrunk so much I get full off a couple bites

My parents have talked to doctors (without me) and the doctors told them I have anorexia based purely on weight charts, but I know anorexia is a lot more complicated than that. I look in the mirror and Im still attractive, I like the way I look but it would make my life a lot easier if i just weighed 30 more pounds. My parents are so involved with my weight that I think it’s overall detrimental. I get calls from their friends and distant family (people I never speak to) on a daily basis asking if I’m okay, even though I’m now fully recovered from my last sickness and never told them about it. I know they’re worried but I wish they never knew I was struggling in the first place. I hate the fact that their first thought about me in years was probably “he’s very sick and skinny I need to tell him we’re all worried”. I wouldn’t have told anyone, and no one would be worried, but they stole that opportunity from me and ignored me when I told them to keep it private. Now I have a line of people to respond to about every day and it’s just annoying more than anything. I love them but I really think they just want me to have the same body as them, which has never been the case in my entire life. 

It’s hard to be so sure though. I could have an eating disorder, I got sick every time after really bad days of anxiety usually following a panic attack. Then as my parents realized I was sick I would get more anxious knowing they’re going to tell my family and my nausea would just take over. I need this cycle to stop and I need to gain weight, even if I don’t have an ED I have something that isn’t right in my life and I want it to be fixed

1426,EDPostRequests,1609713782,kpux1x,"Hi, I’m looking to help my friend with her Ed and I don’t have much knowledge on them. I was hoping this could be posted. 

My best friend is struggling openly with an eating disorder but I do not know how to help her. I’ve never had an ED, I’ve always been naturally skinny and eaten whatever I’ve wanted so I’ve been trying to research ED’s to better know how to help. 
I guess when she was younger she was heavier and she’s been thin since high school she’s 28 now. She is not skinny to a dangerous point at all. If you saw her in public you wouldn’t think she has an ED at all.
I had kind of started realizing she had an ED because she would constantly talk about how “fat” she was and I was so confused because she’s clearly not fat at all. She has an obsession with working out and is constantly counting her calories and weighing her food.
She went on this diet where she was only eating 300 calories a day and I told her that it sounded really unhealthy. She was a personal trainer for a little while and she told me that it was fine. I started realizing just how much she is constantly analyzing her body and complaining about how she looks, mix that together with the scary diets and I realized she had some kind of ED (in my opinion, I’m not a professional).

I kinda talked to her about it and she was like “oh yeah I for sure have an eating disorder”. Fast forward about 6 months to right now, and she told me she’s still only eating 300 calories a day and she feels so guilty if she eats more than that. She said she began purging again, which apparently she hasn’t done in years. She also said she gets light headed when standing up. She works out from home every day. Cardio, leg and butt workouts, etc.

Now again I know very little about this stuff so I apologize if I use the wrong terminology or get things incorrect, that’s why I’m here. The thing about her is that she doesn’t want to be super thin like a lot of the people suffering I’ve read about. She just has these obsessions with hitting these goal weights, idk it’s really hard to explain. 

Like she still wants to have a nice butt and muscle somewhat but also wants to continue to lose weight. I just don’t know how to help her. She feels comfortable telling me about it because I never judge her or tell her she needs immediate help, etc. she kinda told her boyfriend about it but he just says stuff like “omg you need to eat more! Order a burger!” Like he doesn’t get what’s really happening in her mind.

She thinks her eating disorder stems from a long history of childhood issues. Parents, being overweight at some point, sexual assault, etc. She’s also been trying to be an actress for years and has been in some movies and productions (she’s a great actress) but I feel like that adds to the pressure to be “attractive”. I think because her job is so hard she enjoys having control over her body if that makes sense.

Be forewarned: I’ve dealt with binge eating problems before, and this sub has helped me out a lot. The issue I’m about to describe differs in some confusing ways, and it involves a loved one who is not myself. 

My girlfriend has been mentioning dissatisfaction with her body for several months now, specifically targeting herself for not having “enough curves”. As a result, she’s been eating with the expressed goal of gaining weight for a few months now. Sadly, I’ve felt that her complaining about body dissatisfaction has only gotten worse with weight gain. I just am in a confusing position because I’m a girl who believes in health at every size and all that, so I’m not worried about her weight gain itself. I’m more worried about her reasons for such course of action; the way she processes and understands her body seems disordered. Even though she is probably physically healthy, her fixating on her body in any way worries me.

Does anyone know what I should do? Should we look into a doctor of some kind? Is it even worth bringing up with her?

1431,EDPostRequests,1609713607,kpuuwm,"(Post submission) 

I’ve had an eating disorder for more than half my life, but the past ~4 years or so it miraculously hasn’t been bothering me like it used to. Maybe I’m in remission or something, but the urge to restrict and self harm just seemed to go away, and I’ve been quite healthy these past few years, at least compared to how I used to be. I was fine with not being remarkably skinny anymore. But now since covid, I’ve gained way more weight than I’m comfortable with, and it’s caused me to be really really dysmorphic. Some of my clothes aren’t fitting anymore either 😬 However, I’m proud of myself because a couple months ago I made the decision to start at the ((covid precaution-following!)) gym (something I absolutely never would have done when I was super anorexic because I always opted to lose weight via restriction and hated exercise). My goal was to get active and feel good, but not worry about calories— just to get up and get active, and get back to how I was pre-covid in the healthiest and safest way possible. I do a simple treadmill routine and that’s it. It’s done wonders for my mental health and I feel great.

But despite starting at the gym 2 or 3 months ago, I’m not seeing any results. I think I need to improve my routine a bit, and also do what every resource I’ve read is telling me to do, which is track calories and make a calorie deficit. And of course that’s stressing me out because going back to counting calories could very well become a rabbit hole for me, and since this is an ED support group I don’t think I need to explain why. But at the same time, I feel like if I don’t follow the standard recommendation of counting calories, my workouts aren’t going to be effective and I’ll be paying all this money in gym membership fees for nothing, and also continue to be unhappy with my body and sad. 

So, tl;dr, how do I exercise and eat well to slim down in a healthy, safe, and (for lack of a better word) neurotypical way, without becoming obsessed with calories again?

I’ve been incredibly nauseous all the time since probably June. Eventually it developed into acid reflux, to the point of which a small burp would expel nearly everything I ate hours prior. I am,,,, so unbelievably nauseous. All the time. Constant lump in the back of my throat, and I have nasal drip that makes it all worse. 

Around when this started, I started exercising and cooking foods that made me feel less horrible in my stomach in order to feel stronger and maybe lose some weight, but I also started using the acid reflux I was experiencing as an excuse to purge. When I had been nauseous for a few hours and food kept coming back up, I would purge it all. This happened a few times a week and I told myself it was to get rid of the nausea until I talked with my therapist and she finally got me to accept that I was, in fact, bulimic.

I hate weight gain so much, the way my face is puffy, the way that I can see every single pound I've gained in my face, stomach, arms, legs. It's a nightmare. I want to go back to my restriction, back to my calorie counter, back to my friend ana because even though I may be romanticising how I was before, it's better than this. 
What's even weirder is I've tried going back in my old habits but they don't work??? I can't commit?? And I hate that about me, it's a betrayal. I can't go back to how I was and it's so hard for me to find the motivation to continue.

Today is the first day of the new year. I really want to end this negativity. If any of you have tips for getting over weight gain, refeeding syndrome, acceptance, remaining thin but also being healthy please let me know. I'm really struggling atm and I could use some help &lt;3

CW: Self harm, depression, ptsd, eating disorders.

I've been in a very bad place for a while now, and a couple days ago i posted on [r/TeensMeetTeens](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeensMeetTeens/). She pm'd me a few hours later. We talked about our various issues and i asked for her discord. we talked about a bunch of stuff and ended up sharing pics and venting to eachother, and we've revealed more to eachother about our personal self than anybody else in our lives. I dont want to be too corny, but we're basically in long distance relationship at this point, as she lives across the border in another country. I'm not going to go into detail, but she has a lot of trauma, as well as severe depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder. I'm doing my best to try and be supportive, as she essentially saved me from killing myself and i really like her as a person, but i'm worried about doing the wrong things or not helping her in the right way. I've made a deal with her that every time i think of self harming, i will stop and message her, but when i message her she has to send me photos of her eating. Her home life is pretty shit, although she has a very caring sibling, and she only has one other friend who lives far away from her. I'm very cautious of recommending professional help because of her home life, but i might recommend her to see a school counselor once schools are open again. 

I really want some advice on how to help her and maintain our relationship, and also ensure it doesnt turn destructive in any way due to our mental problems,

I'm telling myself that I just need to keep listening to my body and eating when I'm hungry, but I can't stand the thought of gaining any more weight. I'm not supposed to be counting calories anymore, but I counted what I had already eaten today (breakfast and lunch) and saw that I had already eaten more than what I usually would in an entire day.

I've been eating some calorie-dense foods lately. Honestly, I'm of two minds about it. On one side, I really like eating all these foods. They taste good, and I love not feeling hungry. I got so used to feeling hungry all the time that it feels amazing to feel full.

But now it seems like it's taking me more and more food to feel full. I started off just needing to eat 3 meals a day. Then 3 meals and a snack. Now 3 meals and sometimes 2 snacks. I feel like this is getting out of control.

When the pandemic started, things got worse where I was consistently putting in 60-70 mile weeks of running without rest days, though my restrictive eating improved because I started to “accept” that it was okay to indulge a bit when burning 900+ calories per day.

Just over a month ago I had to stop running due to an overuse injury, and to “make up” for it, I’ve been consistently working out (no-impact Pilates, barre, indoor biking) for 2 hours a day. The problem is, I definitely don’t think I’m burning as many calories as before but my food intake hasn’t decreased and I’m starting to feel extremely stressed and anxious to the point that I re-downloaded MyFitnessPal. I’ve tried to tell myself that the muscular definition I’ve put on since the injury is a good thing, but I can feel that I’m on the verge of relapsing into restrictive dieting. I haven’t gained a lot of weight since I generally eat healthy foods, but for the first time since my initial experience with a restrictive ED, I’ve become determined to go back to being underweight. I am bothered by the fact that my leggings almost fit properly again (no longer loose), but I am aware that this is unhealthy and I genuinely hate that my brain thinks this way.

I've never been diagnosed with or treated for an eating disorder, but  doctors have mentioned that it is possible. Thus, I am cognizant of  that and realized that it could involve a factor of issues such as poor  diet, a food allergy, and genetics.

I've noticed that many medical websites said that scales  are very toxic, and I worry about getting into a bad habit of basing my  self worth of that number. I already tend do that with academics. :/

I  am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric  Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants  for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for  self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS.  tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that  delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes.  Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may  help treat depression and other conditions.

We  are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure  (through burning, cutting, or other means). The study involves  completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and six  sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a  double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active  or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from  your own home–no in-person visits are required.

Three  months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication  management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of  $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete  all research procedures.

I’m a 23 yo female. About  two years ago I was diagnosed with anorexia. When this all started I  guess it was because I hated my body, but overtime, I started hating  food (the idea, the smell, the texture, basically everything about it). I  got back up to a normal weight by basically forcing myself to eat, but I  relapsed (I guess) a few months ago when I started a new job. I work  70+ hours a week and and even tho I don’t hate my body (or really no  longer care enough about it to hate it), I hate food. Because of my  schedule and amount of stress I’m under, I can’t even force myself to  eat. I feel sick all the time now and my hair’s started to fall out. If  anyone has any advice on how to make eating less of a chore, I’d really  appreciate it. 

I’m only slightly underweight at the moment but I’m struggling a lot  and really need to get this under control especially before anyone sees  what’s going on (it’s been at least a few weeks since I’ve let anyone  see me in person because of covid).

Hi,

after months/years of being underweight with varied degrees of  severity, I'm back to my pre ED weight. I'm okay with my body now, I  feel ""me"" in it, it's just what I used to look before my ED started.  I've made huge progress mentally and I try to eat an ""adequate"" amount  of calories every day.

Yet I still binge. And when I binge, I purge because I'm scared of  weight gain and can't handle it. I'm constantly hungry, constantly  thinking about food.

Before my ED, I was already an adult and my weight used to be  extremely stable. I wouldn't weight myself often (because I didn't care  enough to do so) but I still wear the clothes I had when I was in high  school. My body size just didn't change that much. So I don't understand  why I cannot seem to maintain it now without restricting.

Nothing seems to work. I've been on a meal plan for a long time, and  not only it led me nowhere, but I've found that my ED thrives on meal  plans because it loves structure, rules and turning every prescription  or suggestion into obsessive rigidity. My therapist says that if I stop  restricting the binges will stop and my body will sort itself out, maybe  I will gain in the short term but then I will fall back to where I'm  supposed to be - but I don't believe him, because for me ""stop  restricting"" means binging on thousands of calories, or at least that's  what happens everytime I try to do it. It just seems a neverending cycle  and I'm exhausted. I literally can't sleep at night because I'm either  hungry and thinking about food, or scared of becoming overweight. All in  all, I feel hopeless and I don't know what to do because my life has  vastly improved in other areas but my ED just stays there.","Request: Back to my pre-ED weight but still binging and very scared, what to do now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/kwhugu/request_back_to_my_preed_weight_but_still_binging/,1610570912,13-01-21 8:48

20f  here, and I have struggled with obsessive exercise tendencies and  caloric restriction over the past few years. When the pandemic started,  things got worse where I was consistently putting in high mileage running weeks of  running without rest days, though my restrictive eating improved  because I started to “accept” that it was okay to indulge a bit when  burning so many calories per day.

Just  over a month ago I had to stop running due to an overuse injury, and to  “make up” for it, I’ve been consistently working out (no-impact  Pilates, barre, indoor biking) for 2 hours a day. The problem is, I  definitely don’t think I’m burning as many calories as before but my  food intake hasn’t decreased and I’m starting to feel extremely stressed  and anxious to the point that I re-downloaded MyFitnessPal. I’ve tried  to tell myself that the muscular definition I’ve put on since the injury  is a good thing, but I can feel that I’m on the verge of relapsing into  restrictive dieting. I haven’t gained a lot of weight since I generally  eat healthy foods, but for the first time since my initial experience  with a restrictive ED, I’ve become determined to go back to being  underweight. I am bothered by the fact that my leggings almost fit  properly again (no longer loose), but I am aware that this is unhealthy  and I genuinely hate that my brain thinks this way.

After a few months of  restricting and binging, about a month and a half ago, I truly turned a  corner and started eating regularly. I felt awesome. I had energy and  peace of mind for the first time in years.

Idk how it happened, but I slipped back into restricting. This time,  it’s easier. I barely have an appetite. I can feel the minimal eating’s  impact on my energy and attention span. It’s making it so much harder to  work and I’m getting weirdly obsessed with my appearance because,  honestly, I like how I’m clearly losing weight. 

I know this is the honeymoon phase. I’ve been here before, and I  can’t imagine this is sustainable or going to end well. But it’s so hard  to convince myself I need to eat three times daily when I’ve gone so  many days without doing that. 

This really was on accident, and I don’t want to hit rock bottom  again or get back into regular binging. That was the worst part, but I  fear I’ll get so hungry and deprived that I’ll lose control, binge, and  lose sight of a normal eating cycle altogether.

I have done screening tests and I know you can’t trust everything you see online, but these are all from reputable sources and they’ve suggested that I’m at least at risk of an ED.

About 6 years ago is when it began and even though I was only about 14 and don’t remember much I remember obsessing over losing weight (even though looking back I was already so slim even though I thought I was extremely big). I would make myself throw up and was very restrictive with food trying to eat very little calories. About a year later the my eating patterns subsided, however these thoughts that I was overweight, my body was horrible, and I needed to lose weight in order to be deemed valuable continued. 


Flash forward to my first year of university and I gained some weight and then once the pandemic and quarantine hit I had a significant weight gain, rendering me overweight. This is where I lost it and went back to these behaviours of throwing up and eating very few calories. In the past few months I lost weight rapidly using these unhealthy tactics but it got me to a what healthcare professionals would deem a “healthier weight”. My obsessive picking apart of my body and the impossible bodily standards I set for my myself that I feel I need to attain just to be deserving of happiness is definitely a problem. But is the eating? Losing the weight I feel like was good and I’m not even underweight now so I feel like I can’t even consider what I have an eating disorder.

I’m about two years clean now. Or.. was. 

So she decided she wanted to lose some weight. Fair enough. She started a strict and unhealthy diet to do so and I again tried to help, but realised I couldn’t. 

She kept posting pics of her alarmingly quick weight loss to our group chat and all of our friends praised her for losing weight. None of our friends minus my partner and myself have had EDs and don’t know how they work. However, all of us do have body dysmorphia problems. 

Every topic she brought up was food, numbers, waist sizes, etc and it was super triggering. I asked her personally several times to please not bring it up in front of me because of how triggering it was. She’d get upset, but agree. 
However, she’d always get right back to it like I never said anything. 

It even got to the point our friends were telling me it was beginning to trigger them, but they didn’t know how to approach her about it since she was so “proud”. 

then I relapsed. I left the group chat for a month and didn’t talk to everyone. But my relapse was common knowledge. Once I joined again, the first conversation was of course her weight loss and relating topics of such. 

After the fifth or sixth time in under three months of asking, I finally had enough and left again. She knew something was up because she kept talking to our friends about me and trying to get my attention. 

I got so stressed out, I left social media. I did a stupid thing and checked her Twitter while signed out and saw her publicly talking about “someone being triggered because of her being proud of her success” and absolutely gaslighting my feelings, so I can assume she got the memo now and was just playing dumb. And of course, her other friends were backing her up. It’s taking everything in me not to hop on and publicly call her out on it   

I’m slowly coming out of my relapse, but it’s hard. She’s now dating my best friend so it makes it even harder to avoid her. 
When I get back online after I talk to my therapist in a few days, I think I’m gonna ditch her and cut the friendship so I can focus on my own health and recovery. Unfortunately, I’ll have to distance myself from my best friend too, who is backing her up.

It is not what I would consider to be a standard eating disorder, but I am certainly no expert, hopefully someone can point me in the right direction. It's been building over the last year or so. 

My 13 year old son started having some issues dealing with noise while he eats. At first it was an occasional burp from me that would put him off his food. Then, it was the sound of my eating. Now he claims that he can't stand to eat around other people and would prefer to eat on his own. Last night was the first night that he outright asked to go eat in the basement instead of at the table. (I guess it could be my eating specifically that sets him off, but I asked my wife last night if I am an abnormally loud eater and she didn't think so) His issue tends to be worse in a quiet environment, he doesn't usually complain about it in public at a restaurant. Knowing that however, I had turned up the radio during dinner last night to combat it, and ate as quietly as possible, but it still wasn't enough. I'm not sure if this is even an issue, or if it is a phase that maybe he will get over as he gets older.

 Since he is an only child, I worry that if I let his issue get the better of him, it will cause issues later in life with regards to his ability to eat socially with other people. He has a healthy appetite and is not a picky eater (other than he doesn't like his food touching on his plate, but that is a less worrisome issue in my mind.) He is also a self proclaimed introvert, so I also worry that he is secluding himself unnecessarily and it could enhance feelings of loneliness.

1486,EDPostRequests,1610451493,kvq2j2,"Around the end of 2018, I started to seriously restrict my caloric intake to a number way below necessary.  I went on for months and months surviving on nothing and then I began to eventually kick it up, only to end up purging whatever i was taking in.  As the summer rolled around, I ended including carbohydrates into my diet again, and was slowly cutting purging away from my life.  I was on a good track record to recovery from my issues and felt a sense of health being restored.  The issue I face now is that I struggle with binge-eating and very rare purging episodes.  I'm not gaining weight as far as I know, but it really makes me feel down on myself.  I constantly fear the scale, I fear my body, and I fear the next few days of restrictive eating.  Sometimes I feel like I have to fast for a day just to reset my calorie budget and I just don't know what to do anymore.  I am way too addicted to that scale number and all the loose skin on my body can never fully fulfill my idea of a healthy form.

1487,EDPostRequests,1610451378,kvq1pc,"I have been in recovery from Atypical AN and OCD based food rituals for about 5 years. For the last 2 years I have been dating the love of my life, and we are hoping to get engaged and married within the next few year. We talk about kids often, and recently I have been wondering how my history of ED symptoms could affect the physical process of become pregnant and carrying a child.

I also suffer with severe social anxiety and PTSD, and a big component of these for me are somatic symptoms (throat tightness, choking, nausea, body shaking, sweating) and depersonalization. I often feel like I don’t have a body at all, and sometimes don’t even recognize myself in videos or in reflections. I think because I have yoyo-ed with my shape and weight so often in the past I have developed this as a coping mechanism to unlink my physical self with my mental sense of self.

I am particularly concerned with becoming pregnant and how these natural changes to my body will impact my ED recovery. I have been working with my therapist to become more aware of my body by trying grounding exercises like putting on lotion or jewelry or doing some stretches like yoga. These are still pretty tough for me, so I am really worried about large changes like a belly or extra weight could be really hard for me and trigger restriction urges- I am worried about myself but even more worried about being able to stay successful with recovery during this transition help my baby be born healthy.

1488,EDPostRequests,1610451261,kvq0ux,"Hey, For almost a year I have been battling my depression. I have Major Depression and have been struggling with motivation and low energy. It feels like my meds are not working anymore, but I believe it is other habits and life changes (aka covid) that is affecting my mental state the most.

Anyways, I have noticed the last month that my body has changed. Last year around this time I was working out 4-5 days a week and didn’t worry about clothes fitting or what I am eating. I felt so comfortable with myself and focused more on health than body image. Once gyms closed I stopped working out. I lost all muscle tone, I began snacking, and just not making the healthiest of choices. So, I have gained a significant amount of weight. It is all throughout my body, not entirely my stomach. I have bulges in my back that I have never noticed and I just struggle feeling good in my clothes (doesn’t help that some are getting tighter).

I have the life sum app that used to track food, water intake, and exercise. Although I am starting to change my eating habits by not snacking, making healthier choices, and not over eating, I am struggling to exercise. This has led me to counting calories, constantly thinking about calories or if said food will affect my weight negatively (even for healthy dishes), constantly body checking, feeling bad for eating. I have not gotten to the point of skipping meals or under-eating consistently but I am happy when I am xxx under calories. I think if I could just get my head outta the clouds and workout despite what the depression is telling me, I will be better, however, that is easier said than done.

1490,EDPostRequests,1610277205,kucpfn,"My mom has always been really conscious about her weight and me and my brother's weights. She always makes meals for us, but never for herself. My stepdad always comments on her not eating anything when she gave us bowls and plates and purposefully never gave herself one. Her excuse for not eating with us is ""I already ate a lot while I was cooking"" or ""I'm not hungry"". I rarely see her eating, and when she does choose to eat some of the meal she cooked for us, she announces it like she wants us to know that's the ONLY thing she ate. 
And my mom is definitely underweight and never admits it. I feel like the constant prodding by my stepdad isn't helping her, as she seems to play it coy when she tells him she's not eating. As if it's attractive. I'm really concerned for her health and I feel like the attention she gets when she doesn't eat is actually enabling this eating disorder. More evidence that makes me think this:  She tells me she brushes her teeth right after ""dinner"" (she didn't eat anything for dinner) so she doesn't feel the need to eat after she brushes her teeth. Every time she weighs herself, she says she's heavy and she gained weight just so my stepdad can assure her she's still skinny. I don't think this behavior is normal. I don't know how much she really eats because she's at work most of the day, but when she's at home she RARELY eats. 
Onto my brother's developing ED:
When my stepdad isn't at our house (he's only at our house once every two weeks) she makes meals for me and my brother that are already portioned in a bowl. Whenever we can't finish for more than a few meals in a row, she get's pretty pissed off, and as a result my brother and I feel pressured to finish the meals. She always fed us a lot and then criticize my brother that he's getting too heavy, whenever he showed her a picture of him, she would say he looks fat in that photo. But he still had to eat her meals. 
Her solution? To run and exercise a lot. My brother really doesn't like exercising and he feels that the other option is to diet; but my mother, as previously shown, doesn't like that idea. So my brother found a loophole, and started sleeping till noon every single day in order to avoid eating breakfast (my mom emphasizes sleep a lot and would not wake us up if we didn't absolutely have to). My brother skipping meals made him start to lose weight (he didn't need to lose weight because he was already at a healthy weight) made my mom compliment him and reward him. 
I feel like her positive attitude towards him losing weight is encouraging this behavior of skipping meals. He really doesn't need to lose weight and I don't want him to not eat anything just like my mom. I'm just the sister/daughter in this relationship and I don't know what to do. The environment me and my brother are in is just centered around weight and being fit. Any advice? Thanks. 
Btw, talking to my mom won't work because me and my brother previously talked to her about her ed a lot, and she refused to admit she had any eating disorder and got frustrated at us because we kept bringing it up.",Request: I think my mom has an eating disorder and my brother is developing one because of it,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/kucpfn/request_i_think_my_mom_has_an_eating_disorder_and/,1610298805,10-01-21 5:13

1493,EDPostRequests,1610155950,ktgxng,"A little backstory about me and my condition. I started bulimia when i was 14 years old. I was a chubby kid, and i played basketball and my biggest issue was my weight, so I figured if I become bulimic i could get in shape and take my game to the next level, it worked. I was bulimic til I was 17 and it felt good, i had a-lot of attention from girls, i looked good, i felt good about it and i thought it was okay. But one day I looked at my teeth and I realized the damage that started to occur so I quit purging for 2 years, i had pearly whites and they were very yellow and started cording. So i stopped for 2 years, it was tough, i went from xxxlbs and in shape to being yyylbs and obese. 

I had everyone telling me basically how bad i looked at whether it was my friends, my doctor my family it was horrible but i fought threw it those 2 years. When i was 19 I started dating a very pretty girl that indirectly made me feel so insecure about myself. So much so while dating her i figured i have to become bulimic so i can look good for her and make her physically attracted to me and to be confident in myself, so it started. Throughout college i was bulimic and it got so bad at points that i would purge and have nothing in my system then drink and almost kill myself accidentally from alcohol poisoning i started to feel random pains in my body and all that, my teeth are corroded to the point the bottoms of my teeth arent straight anymore they are uneven and i even had my tooth chip because they were so weak and i bit down on them too hard. 

I got told by a doctor when i have a fatty liver but never went back because i was scared to find out more. Anyways i had some very personal things happen to me that out me in a really bad spot, i started purging alot more to the point i wouldn't even let food digest i would instantly go to the bathroom and make myself throw up. I dropped from xxxlbs to yyylbs i did catch covid aswell which may have contirbuted to a small part of my weight loss but nothing significant. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont play sports havent for 4 years therefore even though i have lost alot of weight my body i am now skinny fat which is even worse because atleast before i was pretty strong now i feel weak. I have been thinking of recovery for a couple years now but I am not ready for that weight gain. I am 24 and i feel like I have completely ruined my life and any chance of future happiness or confidence with myself. What doesnt help is im from a low class neighborhood some would consider the “hood” and the hyper masculinity in it doesnt help as if you ever talk about mental illness or an eating disorder people will look at you crazy and even gossip about you which is bad because i have no where to escape to about it So i had attempted 2 times to reach out to a doctor for help, and the response they would get is instant confusion as to me being bulimic almost as if i dont sort the criteria of what a bulimic looks like( i know there is no way there supposed to look but others ovbiously dont) which really had not helped my situation.

 I also have dont have friends who could help because i dont feel comfortable letting them know because i had gotten scarred when i told my ex and she left, i thought i could trust her with the world and she did me wrong when i let her know whats going on with me. I therefore dont have the courage to go to a friend. I rambled a little but, My question to you guys is what should i do to recover? I cant stress enough how I really do not want to gain weight, in fact I am terrified about it!

1494,EDPostRequests,1610155456,ktgsm5,"
First off I’m going to give as much info as possible and I apologize if any of it seems insensitive to others eating disorders or somehow triggering. So my girlfriend (21) of 7ish months is recovering from anorexia, she started doing a bit better a month or two before we started dating but has made great progress since that time. Her anorexia didn’t appear to be as severe as it can be for some individuals but she was certainly malnourished. 

I am a very health conscious person, extremely active (sports/lifting) after our first couple months she was doing much better, she had gained a few pounds. She was feeling better and having less health problems, most of those weird aches and pains and health issues that she seemed to have 5 days out of 7 were almost gone. Shortly after that she decided she wanted to start going to the gym with me, she had always wanted to go but never had the confidence to learn everything you need to know to lift by her self. It’s been a few months and she has gone up another few lbs. She looks great but she wants to trim down a few lbs of fat which she is being nitpicky but I can confirm that there is some fat she can lose that would be within a healthy range. She’s at healthy body fat percentage and I know this because we went to take a body analysis test shortly after starting to workout which I know may not seem like a good idea for many with an ED but I try to be very sensitive to the situation and she has handled it very well (I think numbers can be useful and cool to help see progress and growth with muscle and other factors). 

So what I am worried about is if her body has had enough time to recover, her energy levels are as high as they have been in years and she is healthy and feels good 98% of days. But does her body still need more time to regulate? Could cutting down a few  lbs be harmful to her at this stage? I’ve tried researching what happens after recovering from Anorexia and I can not figure out if this would be ok or if her body would even allow it? I’ve read some things, and it makes sense intuitively to me, that the body in an anorexic situation tries to store as much body fat as it can as a response since it knows it may be a minute before the individual provides it with more fuel. So could it take months to a year for the body to transition to storing and utilizing energy the way healthier bodies do? The only reason I am considering agreeing with the situation and not fighting her a bit on it is because we are planning on getting married in a few months and I get that and want her to feel like she’s at her most beautiful.

1501,EDPostRequests,1610155142,ktgpd0,"Hi. This requires some background so I apologize for the length.

I have had dietary restrictions due to food intolerances for three years. Lots of food I can't eat, including nearly all grains, dairy, soy, and a handful of fruits and vegetables. It basically means there is very little processed, pre-prepared, frozen, or restaurant food that I can eat, and I cook nearly everything I eat myself. Due to some still-undiagnosed digestive problems I developed this past year, I adopted an even more restrictive diet (the low FODMAP diet) a few months ago to control my symptoms, which helps somewhat. It's supposed to be temporary, I have just been waiting on some test results, so it's lasted much longer than I anticipated. 

Because of this, I have a lot of difficulty feeding myself. I gained weight without realizing in the last few months because I was snacking on peanut butter mixed with maple syrup to help curb my hunger; not eating enough during the day triggers my insomnia so I sometimes overeat without realizing in attempt to prevent that. Since then, I've been trying to manage these restrictions without eating too much sugar or fat, so I don't keep gaining weight. I've been having a lot of smoothies (spinach, fruit, coconut oil, collagen peptides) because I have a lot of fatigue and am often too tired to cook or meal plan. When I do cook the restrictions make it hard to plan well-balanced meals. So I am sometimes eating just potatoes or just meat instead of a ""complete"" meal. Also, I have a tendency to ""ration"" food so I don't run out before I'm ready to get more. (Example: only eating one serving per meal/not getting seconds, or only eating two meals a day instead of three.) This is both so I don't have to cook as often and because maintaining my diet can be kind of expensive. 

To help my anxiety, which has been worse than ever this year, I started off January doing a 30-day yoga challenge. While it's helped my anxiety tremendously, my fatigue is killer. I don't know if I need to eat more while doing daily yoga, or how much, but I am scared of gaining more weight and mostly, I don't have the energy to figure out what to cook. Today my therapist asked if I might need treatment for eating disorders and I was totally taken aback. I don't even feel like I have control over what or how I eat right now. I'm just trying to get by until I get some medical answers and can hopefully expand my diet again.

I guess I should note that I don't binge, and I don't really restrict except for the obvious food intolerances that give me symptoms. I do try to avoid added sugar because I can overindulge very easily, plus it makes my anxiety worse.

I have memories of people shaming my body since I was 4 years old, saying for example why I don’t suck in my stomach, one day an aunt asked me when I will start the diet. One day I was sick and she told my grandma that she will give me pills but the doses of an adult because I has bigger than I should. 

wasn’t even 10yo when I heard those comments and I can’t stop thinking about them. In my school I was the bigger of my classroom even though I was never obese, just overweight, maybe  few more kg more than I should. My classmates didn’t bully me a lot but some comments hurted me a lot, my brother and my cousin were the most hurtful, they told me I was fat everyday. I’ve always pretended the comments of my body were funny but inside I’m sick of them, I all I thought was when people meet me they will think that I’m fat, fat was the only word that described me. Before 12yo I thought I wasn’t big, that I will loose weight naturally and I shouldn’t worry about it. Puberty came and boys started commenting on my body, saying I was fat, my acne was ugly, etc so at the age of 13 I lost a lot of weight. I was hungry all the time i had a rough idea of how many calories I consumed,

&amp;#x200B;

 i maintained that weight for 2 years and then I couldn’t restrict myself anymore so I started eating all the foods I didn’t allow myself to eat, I gained most of the weight I had lost. I was so traumatized of how my body looked before so I started doing a lot of exercise and in that time I met a guy so I wasn’t thinking much about food I just remember I never ate because I wasn’t hungry enough( unconsciously I think I was restricting myself) and lost the amount  I gained. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next year I didn’t think about food but idk how I slowly gained all the weight back, the boy left me and until today I think he left me because I gained weight and I wasn’t attractive anymore. I’ve yo-yo dieting since then, I’ve lost and gain a few  kg several times, and my body image when I’m xx kg(a healthy weight) is terrible, I can’t stop thinking of how bad I look and I can’t loose weight. 

I’ve run until 1am just to lose weight, also I’ve thrown up a few times(maybe 4), I’ve tried everything and nothing works losing weight seems imposible and I feel sick of trying. The idea of accepting myself with this weight seems imposible to me, that thought stays in my mind 24/7 I’m so tired of hating myself. Going out with my friends is a horrible sensation because I always compare myself to them, the people around me is so skinny and I am so big, i try to eat healthy most of the time but my family always buys junk food and I can’t resist all the time. I have been thinking about going to therapy for 1 years but I have delayed taking the hour for so long! the next week I have an appointment to therapy but I’m scared of telling all the things I’ve been through.

My thinking why this could be disordered eating/pica is because I eat from the trash in secrecy, and I know eating in secrecy is a common symptom in other eating disorders. I also feel like the food ""doesn’t count"" from the trash and thus I’ll eat it. I contracted parasites two or three times and I honestly think it’s from eating garbage. 

However, I could see this as being just a ""bad habit"" (and thus not disordered eating/pica) since I only eat things that are *technically* edible. I eat ice sometimes, but I eat a lot of expired/spoiled/raw food too. I eat ""normal"" (still ""good"" as in not expired or spoiled) food out of the trash, too. 

I don’t know how to find a doctor for this. The main reason I ask this sub is because it’s an eating habit, and thus could be disordered eating. I can’t pass the online eating disorder screening tests because my problem isn’t rooted in body image. I feel like because it’s not one of the major eating disorders, a dietitian wouldn’t be interested in helping me. 

Just to clarify because I think it’s important given this topic: my financial situation has no correlation whatsoever to eating out of the trash. I can thankfully afford food and I grew up in a family where I, thankfully, didn’t have to worry about when my next meal would be.

I have realized my relationship with food is not normal and I'm trying to recover. For the last year, I was constantly thinking about food, I restricted food intake and I lost a significant % of my body weight and my period. I was also over-exercising. I'm already a competitive runner, but I would make sure I did at least one extra workout a day on top of what I was already doing. Sometimes it's about body image and nutrition, but it's also a way to punish myself, to be in control of something in my life, and to see how much pain I could put myself through, which would make me feel better. I've tried talking to my parents about this but they don't think I have an eating disorder. My mom thinks I'm just being picky and not being grateful for the food they buy. She also thinks I can't be sick because although I was underweight, my physical appearance never got to the point where I looked anorexic and needed to be hospitalized. My dad thinks my behavior around food is fine and I'm actually being healthier. It hasn't occurred to him that I might have an ed. My dad constantly tells me how I need to exercise daily because children need exercise and I'm young so my body can handle it. I've said that I don't think that's best for my health (since I'm trying to get my period back), but he tells me I need to get my information from better sources instead of making stuff up and assuming I’m right. Sometimes his comments trigger my restrictive behavior, but when I tell him, he thinks I'm being problematic and not making sense. I also tried to tell them that it's not always about food, which they thought I was making up to cause drama. They also always somehow make it about them. My mom said that I need to stop being so selfish. She said that when I starve myself, I’m only putting her in pain because she was the one who gave birth to me, so I should be grateful for the life she gave me instead of making her watch me not eat. My dad says that I need to stop my immature behavior and manage my emotions better because when I refuse to eat and I’m always upset, it’s ruining the household environment and my relationship with them. I feel like nobody understands what I'm going through or wants to understand. I've been feeling pretty worthless and like I have no hope for recovery.

1522,EDPostRequests,1611106953,l0yrux,"Hi there. This is my first time posting here. I have felt the need to talk about this with someone for so long that I have finally decided to share how I feel since this seems like a safe space.

I (16F) technically don’t have an ed since I have never been diagnosed or gone to a doctor for this. Based off of what I have read, I think I might: I usually won’t eat till late at night, I hate my body, I wish I could be thinner, I constantly compare my body to others, I weigh myself continuously through out the day, I try not to eat any heavy/dense foods that could influence my weight (like water or potatoes)

A while ago, my mom took me to a nutritionist to gain weight and work on my eating since I’m a cross country runner. I was extremely underweight. I told both my mom and the nutritionist that my low weight was just because I am running a lot and I told them I wanted to gain weight and be healthy (this was a lie and I said nothing about my poor relationship with food). I tried to delay the weight they wanted me to gain for as long as possible by throwing out my lunches in school, running a lot, drinking water before getting weighed, and wearing heavy clothes when getting weighed). Then one day, my mom yelled at me, saying that I probably have an ed and asking why I would do this to her. I promised her that I wanted to gain weight (a lie) and told her I did not have an ed. This event basically scared me into eating a lot and reaching my goal weight (I was extremely unhappy with my body at that point)

Now, almost a year later, I feel so lost and alone. I hate my body and stare at it constantly in the mirror. I have lost some weight since then. I would like to weigh even less, but I don’t want my mom to notice; whenever she brings up my weight, I immediately panic and convince her I’m fine. I’m so scared of what will happen if she finds out I’m significantly below a normal weight, especially since I have been lying to her about my eating and weight for an entire year (when she asks how much I weigh, I lie and say I’m where I should be when in reality I’m much lower). I feel like she just doesn’t understand what it’s like for someone who feels like I do; it’s not as simple as just eating more food. I’m so desperate to tell someone (like a family member or even a teacher), but I’m scared of what will happen. If my mom finds out, she’ll hate me.

Has anyone else encountered a similar situation? I just feel so lost and lonely, I don’t know what to do. Maybe I’m overreacting idk. Any advice or replies would be appreciated.

Okay, let's go. This will probably suck. 
Sorry.

I'm SICK of my distorted self-perception. 
I was always thin (ooh you could be a model, wow I wish I had your metabolism, etc. 🙃) and at the same time I always saw myself a little ¿chubby? jsksks hate that word.
Anyway, never payed that much attention to it until a few years ago. The disconnection between my real body and the image I have of it began to increase.
Last year it's been a hell, mostly in my mind.
At the beginning of the quarantine I noticed I was really underweight because my period (that was somehow starting to normalize) stopped, and I started to feel very cold and that my bones ached? like when I would lie in bed or lean my hips against something, for example a wall.
I tried to eat more bc my mother was worried and I got scared. Also, close people told me how thin I was and that made me feel bad. 
I was tired of looking like a cadaver, so a couple of months later started weightlifting. That helped me gain a few Kg.
Thing is, I really made progress since I started exercising because I noticed how my muscles grew. BUT I'd switch (and still do) between moods, going from fucking Patrick Bateman and wanting to kiss my biceps, to thinking 'damn, I'm really skinny. Gotta do something RN, I must take this as serious as it is'. And then """"""realize"""""" I'm overreacting and being ridiculous, because obviously I'm not that skinny. In fact, I should lose some weight, train harder or do something to fix myself.
If you ask me, being as realistic and objective as I can, I'd say I'm not fat at all. I know I'm thin.
But when it comes to my twisted reality~, everything changes. And I don't know what the fuck to do.
On the one hand I want -and often think about- to commit and try to reach my daily calorie intake, buy that whey protein I was looking for, keep exercising, stop being obsessed blah blah
The problem is that I JUST CAN'T. I have this stupid fixed idea that I'll end up getting fat when I know I won't bc my body doesn't work that way and bc it's all made-up 
So I'll restrict (conscious or unconsciously), feel bad if I don't have time to exercise, weigh everything I eat, if I can't weigh it I'll spend a lot of time thinking about it and trying to figure it out so I can register that on the damn app.
I literally will stand in front of the mirror and look at my clavicles, ribs, hips and then think 'Okay, Imma show myself how mature I am. I will start by doing all of the meals and reaching my cals next week'.
Next, look at my protruding bones again and realize I'm gonna miss that.
I want to do it because I know I should, I know this isn't healthy and I already have other mental problems, I don't need more.
But I can't let it go. I like being skinny.
I know that if I start eating just pizza, ice cream and Coke I will still be skinny but 1) my mind doesn't care about those facts, it's like 'hell no, if you even think about putting a finger on that banana you'll end up in one of those home&amp;health shows.
2) Guilt. If I eat something that isn't healthy I feel really bad. If I eat the calories I'm supposed to eat, I feel bad. If I'm hungry while others aren't, I feel bad. If I eat two portions when everyone ate one, I feel bad.  
Since I wake up I'm thinking about how many calories I ate, how much I'm gonna weigh tomorrow, obsess about how is the next meal going to be so it fits my macros...
If my friends or someone invites me to do something that involves food I'll think all the time about what are we gonna eat, what can I do to reject that food, how can I replace it and under what excuse, etc. etc.

And as if that wasn't enough, during quarantine I struggled with some notsobig binges here and there. Luckily that's being solved.
Many times thought about throwing up just bc I felt full and that disgusted me. Always stopped myself bc I have many reasons not to do it.
I finally did after Christmas (partly because I got sick) and realized puking is awful and that I don't wanna do it on a daily basis. I guess that's the only good thing.
On top of that, lately I've felt depression is back. Although I really like to cook, I don't have the energy to do it. I just lie on the couch thinking I'm hungry, should eat. But not being able to stand up and grab something. Usually a few hours pass until I decide what I'm going to eat, and always ends up being idk water and two noodles I found stuck on the floor.

Hi, I’m sorry if this doesn’t fit in this subreddit I’m just very confused with my eating right now and I don’t know where else to ask. During the pandemic I have been really stressed with online schooling and such and Im aware this could be a factor into my eating. It started with me just not being hungry and forgetting to eat which wasn’t a big deal for me, I figured it would go away with time and working on myself but it didn’t it just got worse, over time I’ve found myself actively avoiding eating or eating very little of food because I dislike the feeling of eating or I just don’t want to eat. now the reason I’m sure this isn’t anorexia nerviosa is that I’ve never had much issue with my body, sure I look in the mirror and wish I could loose weight- I dislike my stomach and some of the pudgier bits but overall I am ok with it. I’ve never been one to think “I can’t eat because I’ll get fat” or actively try to avoid food for that reason but now Im avoiding food because of the feeling of it, I guess the easiest way to describe it is I don’t like the process of eating. I hate the way it feels to chew and swallow something and become full and often after eating I feel bad about it.

1528,EDPostRequests,1611106830,l0yqij,"Hi, 

So basically my younger sister is doing some things which are triggering my ED mindset, such as skipping meals, or eating very little for instance, only an apple for lunch (nothing else before or after) and then dinner as normal and eating very slowly, then drinking loads of water after/tea (looks like she's trying to fill herself up or has read something online about it). 

It's like she's read loads of stuff online about weightless (stupid stuff like no bread, no pasta, no rice, only eat fruit and eggs, drink water/tea before and after meals etc..) 

Just really hard to be in a positive mindset about food near her. However, if I am away from her I constantly worry she is trying to follow these stupid rules/habits she has read online and believes is good for weight loss/being 'healthy'. I also noticed in her search history she was looking at ways to lose weight and by no means do I think she should since she is at a healthy weight and her body is healthy (menstral cycle and that). 

Also also, another issue I have is that my dad constantly talks about these 'healthy' lifestyle choices and promotes it (like intermittent fasting, not eating bread, rice, pasta etc. which is so STUPID especially to teenagers!!). My sister never really listened but it seems like she has now, she does all the things he has 'advised' and it's quite worrying. I've spoken to this about her and it seems like she now believes eating breakfast, bread, rice, pasta will make you unhealthy, so she doesn't. However my dad worries about her since she doesn't really eat that much anymore (controversial right?)

Since graduating, I've put back on the weight and more besides, and I felt my relationship with food was
healthy again (and I'm at a healthy weight). I am still very self-conscious of how I look and of the weight gain as I think it's quite obvious to those who have known me a while.

A friend from high school just moved in with me, and it's become clear that she may have an eating disorder; she restricts her food a lot, doesn't eat for most of the day, and casually mentions how many calories are in some things. She also showed these signs in high school, but has never explicitly said that she has an ED. She has said that she doesn't like talking about weight and amounts of food, etc. I've found it really hard to watch her restrict. I've found it hard not to feel guilty about the amount of food I've eaten that day, especially now that I'm noticing that my clothes are tighter than they used to be. I've also found myself eating less and later in the day and considering going back to my old habits.

1539,EDPostRequests,1610919514,kzfnj7,"Hi!

I (25, M) have had incredibly disordered eating for a number of years now. Very long story short, I was a thin child from a fat family, used to be a ballet dancer, quit ballet, put on a lot of weight to the point I was clinically morbidly obese, spiralled into alcoholism (I'm 2 years sober now and in a 12 Step Program), then in 2017 I had a break from university (took ""leave"" in February 2017 to restart that academic year in September 2017, because of the aforementioned addiction issues) and I decided that I wanted to lose weight, I decided to do this with extreme calorie restriction (aided by a particular phone app that counts calories in food) and more than quadrupling my exercise (the same app also uses step count on your phone to work out how many calories you're burning, I passed out at the gym multiple times, had ketone breath, everything, but I didn't think I had an ED because, in my mind at the time, people with ED don't think about food, they think about weight, also, I was objectively, medically still overweight, so I told myself that I couldn't have an ED, I just like to get things done fast and not by half measures). 

Without going too heavy on this and glorifying it or using numbers, the amount of weight I lost in such a short space of time meant that when I went back to my university just to visit for the end of year ball, people genuinely didn't recognise me, I felt great etc etc. The problem is that ever since late 2017 and now, and especially since I got sober at the end of 2018, I have lost and regained the same *amount* in weight about 10 times through a mix of unhealthy secret binging and then extreme restricting, when I stopped losing weight I was actually underweight in BMI. 

Lockdown has been awful, I have been binging full on most days and I'm now back at a weight that I haven't seen since 2017, I'm only a few pounds away from being technically overweight again. I'm in the UK and we're currently in our third national lockdown, and now that I don't have the emotional support blanket of alcohol (a blanket that I do not want back, my life is so much better sober) I just can't stop myself binging until I feel sick, hating myself, then doing extreme home workouts during the day and then binging at night and body checking, my particular issue is with my chest, one of the reasons I wanted to lose weight in the first place is that I had a lot of fat on my chest and now after I binge, I feel like I can feel my chest expanding- which I know logically is ridiculous, but such is disordered binge eating haha. 

I don't know if anyone in here knows how to break the toxic cycle of this? I've been struggling with this immense self hatred, and I really want to break the cycle. I actually logged onto my laptop today to try and trigger myself into restricting massively tomorrow, but I know that if I heavily restrict, I'll just end up binging again and i really don't want to spend another night feeling so full that I feel sick or trying to avoid my reflection in shiny surfaces or not getting undressed before bed because I can't bring myself to look at my body etc etc etc.

I'm so sorry for the long post, I've literally never talked to anyone about this before and it's been going on since 2017, everyone I know sees me as some beacon of weight loss and turning your life around, when really, I'm a fraud in that regard. The closest I've come to any help is that I've watched a couple of YouTube videos (Of Herbs and Altars and Chris Henrie) and I watch their videos like ""ooh damn, I used to do x...

Background: I have been anorexic and bulimic for almost a decade. I went to get help in high school but was told that, given my condition, I had to go into inpatient and I wasn’t willing to leave school/sport/friends/family etc. outpatient was not an option. It got worse and I went to get help in college through my schools ED program but I stopped because, although my doctor/nutritionist/therapist left the decision up to me, they relentlessly pushed inpatient treatment on me which I was again unwilling to do. They would ask things like “do you not want to get help because you’re suicidal?” and I couldn’t deal so I stopped seeing them. I have an eating disorder yes but I think I am strong. I wanted to avoid seeing myself in the light with which they saw me- a wounded bird and deranged person wrapped up in one. Things got a little better within another year so I tried again but ran into the same issue where I was told that outpatient was not an option. My weight is the worst it’s been but I’m still unwilling to take a semester off or forego an internship this summer to get help. I am unable to recover alone. I’ve tried so many times. I know I should do inpatient but I wont make that choice for myself. 

How can I get help without having to put my “life” as i know it on pause? I was thinking that perhaps because of covid, there are more rigorous outpatient programs that I could engage in while remaining in school. Maybe treatment centers are offering outpatient for patients that would (in a covid-less world) need inpatient. I don’t have the strength to call and ask because I anticipate having to go through the same thing I did in the past. If anyone knows that this may be true what is it like? Is anyone in treatment and school at the same time? Or perhaps there’s a totally different medium I could try like a support group that may work?

But I’ve been at this phase of my recovery for five or six years now - with the occasional backslide. I still struggle significantly with disordered thoughts and body image. I’ve kind of accepted that what I see in the mirror is not what I actually look like but it’s challenging to feel so continuously disconnected from my body. I recently saw a picture of myself from about a year ago where I appeared underweight. And at the time I had no idea. Does the dysmorphia ever go away? Anyone else struggled to make the leap from tolerance/acceptance to self-love? 

Part of what is exacerbating this is my mom makes negative comments anytime I appear to have lost weight.

I made sure that when I moved back in June, that my new apartment wouldn't have a scale in it, because if I have access to a scale, I'll weigh pretty much any time I see it and obsess over the number. I also gained a pretty significant amount because of quarantine, and I just didn't want to think about it any more than I already do just looking at myself in the mirror and feeling my body. I feel like I messed up majorly today. I was briefly visiting family and I had to use the restroom, and there was a digital scale on the floor. It felt like I physically couldn't stop myself from stepping on it. And the number was higher than I thought it would be. The guilt and dread instantly set in, and I knew I'd messed up by weighing myself. I'm considered ""overweight"" now. I was just flooded by all sorts of thoughts about how I should start restricting again, calorie counting, exercising in excess, and about how many calories I should eat to get my weight back down. I started fixating on a number I wanted, even though I know that I'll never actually be satisfied, as much as I think I will be in the moment. I'm glad I haven't seen my mom since June, most of all. I know she'd be disappointed in me, like she already was when I'd gained a little at the beginning of the pandemic. I confided in my partner about the fact that I'd weighed myself and how much it upset me, and it felt like they were disappointed in me.

The thing is that there like some little small things that might not be considered totally normal, but its not like stopping my life.

I have a bf and I love him, he knows that I had an ed for a long time so thats like it. The thing is that he smokes weed and doesnt eat much because he is not hungry. I dont think is disordered because I know many people that smoke and I feel this tends to happen. He eats like once a day, maybe twice and I cant eat like that, I need snacks and proper food a few times per day, but living together has made it difficult.

When we stayed together for a day or two, when I got home the first thing I did was EAT! Like I was so hungry... Somehow I am ashamed the amount of food I really wanna eat, or how many times I wanna eat per day. Also I feel guilty about eating the food that I bought lol, like as its food from the two I feel bad about just grabbing something, because its been a few times were he's been like ""I was gonna use that for a recipie"" or I was getting pizza leftovers (I ate half of the leftovers and left half for him) and was like ""why didnt you ask if I wanted"". So in essence I have to ask for permission for food I bought in my own house and that triggers me AF. It makes me feel I dont deserve it!

Oh I forgot to say, I can go on walks and just grab something eat it and go back home, I mean its not ideal because eating in secret is like not too good, but at least I would get nourished. I also did wait sometimes he went out to eat, I tried to eat stuff that I guess he wouldnt mind like rice or some stuff (I know this is also kinda f up), but 2 days ago I got covid, I am fine and all, just tired and I am gonna be fine. The thing is that I cant eat in secret now and I am eating the same stuff and the same portions and the same times as he is and gosh I am so hungry!

. Idk what to do, I wish I could just go to the fridge and grab food and cook it and eat it like any normal person but gosh I am just on the bedroom crying and being hungry.

Since then I’ve been doing well, eating three times a day, keeping balanced nutrition, getting a healthy level of low impact exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. 

Recently I put on a few pounds, and have been feeling absolutely awful about it, even though I’m still well within the healthy range. I have been trying to maintain a healthy diet regardless of my disordered thoughts. To do this, I told myself I had to eat when my boyfriend eats. We live together, so encouraging that we eat meals together has really kept me motivated to eat enough to stay healthy. 

The problem is that over time this subconsciously shifted from “I have to eat if my boyfriend is eating”, to “I can’t eat if my boyfriend isn’t eating”, and I didn’t even notice the shift. He recently had his wisdom teeth taken out and can’t eat regular meals. I have been spiraling into my eating disorder since. 

I have a hard time getting myself to eat in front of him if he’s not also eating. But I am aware that I need food to survive and remain in recovery. I went from eating a well balanced three meals per day to the last few days where I’ve only drank coffee. Today I forced down a small salad and a few chips. But I can’t keep up like this. I have tremendous guild whenever I feel hungry, I have noticed that I’m checking my body frequently, and I can’t stop wondering how much I weigh. 

How do I get control of my disorder again? I feel so stupid, because it almost feels like it never left. I can’t really talk to my boyfriend about how I’ve been feeling.

1553,EDPostRequests,1610766345,kyal8j,"The subject of food has always been touchy for me. I’ve struggle with poor body image, which has lead to calorie counting, restricting, and then ultimately binging at the end of the day when I’m absolutely starving. 


I’ve reached a point in my life where I’m more accepting of my body and where I’m eating more regularly during the day. Some days I eat more, some days I eat less. I’ve also stopped labeling foods as good and bad — some days I eat *healthier*, some days I want a donut. Which has helped a lot. 


One thing that still and will probably always make me uncomfortable is when someone points out to me how much/little, or what I’m eating. This has always bothered me, and it feels like they’re pointing out something bad.


I work as a massage therapist, I’m usually always snacking on something in between appointments. (Not always, but some days I’m a little hungrier.) Well this year I decided to add a proper lunch break into my schedule. A colleague mentioned she noticed the 1/2 hour break I added in. “It makes sense, you’re always snacking in between clients” is what she said to me. This isn’t the first time a colleague has pointed out how much I eat while at work. The last time it happened, they called me Miss. Piggy. Another colleague laughed at me the other day “I always see you eating” — I decided to lightly clap back and say “Well I either eat now or  binge when I get home.” Then they retracted what they said. I don’t think they intended to hurt my feelings— but it did. 


It’s even worse when someone comments on *what* you’re eating.

I’m not sure if this is the correct place to post this as i don’t believe i necessarily have an eating disorder, so if anyone has a better community to post this in please let me know because i am getting so desperate. 

first off, i have depression, anxiety, and adhd. i’m definitely prone to eating disorders and have had close family members who are in recovery. so i’ve always been cautious to make sure to nip any unhealthy mindsets about food in the bud if they arose. but anyway, to my dilemma. I had breast reduction surgery on 10/8. it’s a pretty easy procedure but it’s still a surgery and my body is still recovering and under stress. then my job started to get stressful with the holidays coming up so i was working long hours. then i moved into my new home at the end of november. then my job started becoming even more stressful when the holidays were upon us. my parents are barely following the “you know what” guidelines, which worries me a lot. in the beginning of December, i got diagnosed with ADHD and started medicine for it, which is known for decreasing appetite. basically, i’ve been very stressed which makes my anxiety skyrocket and my depression worse. 

i’ve never had this happen to me for so long before (longest maybe a day or two when depressed), but i have not had an appetite since mid october. i am hungry and want to eat, but when i try to find something, it makes me feel physically sick thinking about eating. i’ve thrown up just from taking a couple bites before because my appetite is so non existent my throat closes up and i just can’t do it. i have to get high to eat. i hate it. especially because i can’t be high during work, so most of the time i don’t even eat until around dinner time. it’s so draining and frustrating, which i’m sure makes things worse. 

i’m really truly at my breaking point and i don’t know what to do. i was slightly overweight before, and now with the weight i have lost in the past couple months i am on the lower end of normal weight. and i stopped working out all together because i started to feel woozy afterwards. so the weight loss is just from simply not eating as much as i need to. i believe i am unintentionally starving myself. i feel my relationship with food getting worse and worse and i’m scared this will escalate into an actual eating disorder (if i don’t already have one?). 

i don’t know if this is some kind of eating disorder as i WANT to eat. so badly. but it seems to be mentally impossible unless i’m high. i hate it so much. i cry almost everyday from it. please, any and all advice would be so appreciated. i don’t know what to do. i’m desperate.",Request: No appetite since mid-October.

My boyfriend is currently living in a college home with his close friends and the culture of the house is not the healthiest :( I know they're all broke college students but they seriously are living in the worst conditions... the fridge is full of moldy food and the kitchen is all broken and barely works and they don't really cook much other than mac and cheese or the occasional ramen. They drink a couple of times a week and just sort of chill all day because they're graduating college this semester.

My boyfriend especially has been putting on a little bit of weight this year and I still think he is well within the healthy range, but it's clearly making him insecure. For example, yesterday I was at his house all day and all he had was a ramen packet and some shrimp and later in the night, he had a can of Truly with his friends :( That is not enough food to sustain anyone and it's seriously unhealthy. I even ordered extra food in and hoped he would eat some but he didn't :/ I went to bed first and noticed he wasn't next to me and then when he came back he told me he went to work out :( After that, I could hear his stomach grumbling all night and it was seriously breaking my heart. This has also been going on since like the summer.

I spend a lot of time with him so I see him not eat a single meal until like 7pm and then he will eat and complain about how bloated he is and how he wishes he didn't eat so much. I'm really getting worried about him and I don't know how to express it because he's not taking it seriously at all! Yesterday I sort of put my foot down and told him it's seriously upsetting me and I need him to eat but I don't know if this was the best move or if that's how these things are to be handled. When I look online for resources most of them tell me to just sit down and talk to him or speak to a family member but these aren't really applicable to the situation because 1. his family comes from a culture that doesn't believe in such things 2. he is not taking it seriously enough to have a genuine conversation.

I'm just so worried about him... I really don't know how to get through to him that not only is this super damaging to his health but he also won't really be meeting his fitness goals if he doesn't eat enough food or protein!!!

1563,EDPostRequests,1611614462,l4zlph,"Hi, I think I just need an outside perspective on whether or not I need to seek help, or whether this is normal.

Firstly, I (36F) know logically I’m not “overweight” but I feel that I am (5’4, weighing between 53 and 59kg, it fluctuates a lot).  I feel like I look overweight and unattractive.  I exercise frequently, and if I don’t exercise for some reason then I feel like I don’t “deserve” to eat at all for the day (like I haven’t earned the calories).  I’ll avoid food for as long as possible but usually cave in the evening when I decide I don’t care what people think about how I look.  And then of course I get an immediate attack of the guilts about what I have just eaten and vow not to do it again.

If I don’t exercise, I am in a foul mood all day.  I will often exercise even if injured or sick.

Whenever I eat anything it is always in the context of “is it worth the calories” so eating out / having nice things is very stressful because it has to be super special to justify having it - and of course not everything is as nice as it looks.

I see other people just eating and having nice things and it doesn’t seem like they have this internal battle constantly.  I think about calories/food/weight a lot.

Disclaimer: This is my first post on Reddit, ever. I tried to find a post that was similar to my issue so that I might not have to ask everybody the same question, but I could not find something that helped me. If you think there is a post that could help, please let me know!  

Hi folx.  I have read some of the posts here while trying to figure out my own issue and I just wanted to say that I love each and every one of you, and I hope to support everyone on the road to recovery or at least understanding.  

I would like to try to make a long story short but that feels difficult to do in this post.  I am a 22-year-old college student that rents and lives alone. Simply due to the nature of life, the friends I have are in different states for college, I only see my family once a week, and I do not have much social interaction outside of seeing my coworkers because of COVID.  This is not to say I don’t have a support system, but rather that I am just not physically with others often.

I have dealt with disordered eating for a great deal of my life. I could not say for sure but I believe the problem is truly began around the time that I was 12 or 13 years old.  I became a vegetarian at that age for the health benefits. However this was a mixed signal; the health benefits of reducing possible heart problems (common in my family) as well as weight loss.  I have received mixed signals and comments on my body ever since I was young (obviously I wish nobody had said anything at all).  At some point during high-school I silently struggled with anorexia.  The road to recovery was extremely difficult because I was alone, and today I still struggle with disordered eating it, however for the most part I feel that I have a healthy perception of my body.  

When I turned 17 I started smoking p*t and that truly helped with regulating my appetite and mood (which ties into my appetite).  Now that I am an adult and it is legal in my state, I have gotten myself a medical card.  I used smoking as a crutch to regulate my eating for a long spell, but I am realizing that I often lose my appetite to stress and I do not eat when I need to.  Even if I have smoked, I still do not want to eat even if I feel hungry.  This is not because I am actively telling myself that I do not want to eat, but my body does not feel like eating. I know that it’s not really conveying that, and that it does need food, but that’s what it feels like.

This is where my problem really comes into play.  Whenever I am alone, which is pretty much all of the time, it is not that I forget to eat but I simply do not force myself to do so. It’s like it’s pointless to eat because there’s nobody to eat with me. As if somebody needs to watch me consume so that I can enjoy eating.  And this is where it becomes extremely pathetic to me.  Unless I am at my parents house to do laundry and they are cooking food that they sit in front of me, or if my boyfriend is home from college and wants to eat food with me, I do not eat that much.  I simply do not find it enjoyable. Even if the meal is easy like a protein bar or a protein shake, I don’t want it. Putting anything into my body feels like a chore and it feels unnatural. Sometimes I feel guilty about eating when I’m alone and I don’t know why.  It scares me because this happens often, pretty much any time I feel stress (which is often - I do exercise, meditation, and write in my journal to help release stress, but I feel stress heavily all of the time anyway).  

The problem is that my entire journey with food has been invisible to others and I am always too afraid and ashamed to ask for help.  If anyone has any kind of advice for regulating of food schedule when you live alone and are alone but really enjoy eating with others, I would appreciate it. It took a lot to post this and I feel like crying.",Request: Struggling to eat consistently when alone,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/l3n2nm/request_struggling_to_eat_consistently_when_alone/,1611465379,23-01-21 17:16
1577,EDPostRequests,1611443769,l3n2jf,"I've always struggled with health issues from an early age, and I have a condition that causes me to be extremely sick frequently. I've had to structure my whole life around taking the right medications, eating the right foods, sleeping at the right times, and so much more, but even then, I still become sick, and I've always had a hard time accepting that this is beyond my control. As soon as I realized that none of my peers went through the same thing, I tried to hide it as best I could, and I would do anything to stop an attack, even if that meant not eating for days. 

My chronic illness causes my weight to fluctuate with severe episodes, and I would often be hospitalized because I needed fluids. As a result, my body fat was very low, even when I increased my muscle mass, so I would often find myself looking in the mirror to check what I looked like. My doctors were concerned, so they told me to gain more weight, but they always blamed my inability to gain weight on my conditions. 

I went through a very traumatic experience because I kept having my medications switched, and I experienced so many side effects. Some medications made me feel so out of it that I would forget everything I did that day. I would be driving somewhere and I'd forget where I was going, and where I had been before, so I would have to call my parents for help. Some medications triggered my epilepsy, so I was afraid to leave my dorm because I didn't want to fall and hurt myself. I also didn't want to scare the people around me by having an attack. I ended up controlling my food more because I thought that made me feel better. If I had just been honest with my doctors and told them why I couldn't eat enough, I would have been able to stay on my previous medications that had been working. 

I've denied my obsession with controlling my food for too long. I can't eat at restaurants anymore, even if they cater to my dietary needs. I make myself fast for multiple days before events or special occasions. I have managed to reach a healthy weight, but I still suffer from attacks, and sometimes I binge eat after I fast for a long time. After I binge eat I start exercising a lot more, and sometimes I hurt myself from over exercising. 

I weigh all of my food and fill out a spreadsheet tracking calories, nutrients, my weight, all of the medications I took, and how I slept every day. My doctors applaud me for being responsible, but I don't think this is healthy. I do go to therapy, but I've never opened up to any of my therapists. I've never opened up to anyone about this. I don't have any friends, my brother hates me, and my parents never help me feel better, they just tell me what I'm doing wrong.

I  am a 18 year old cisgender male, and I am in a relationship with a 17  year old transgender male. His issues with his gender and dysphoria  contribute to his struggles with eating and dont do him any good  service. I can help him with his dysphoria, and make him feel better  about himself in that sense, and have asked him honestly about this. He  says that I am very helpful and help him to get over this.

However,  he is currently going through a spell of eating very little, and I dont  understand how to help. It is rare that he will be able to eat totally  care free, and more often than not will be struggling to some extent.  However it is rarely as bad as it is now. Other than a cracker and  (minimal) cheese that he had yesterday, he ingested 0 calories;  including drinks. For the past week, he has practically eaten nothing at  all other than one day where I was with him and got him to eat a hot  sausage roll, relatively comfortably, and then when he went home he had  to eat some roast that his mum had cooked for him. He ate about xxxx calories (still low) that day and was extremely distressed as a result. This is so  difficult for me to see, as someone who had never really consciously  struggled with eating before as I know even the average, suggested  amount is still much more than that. I dont understand how to help.

I  have looked up what to say to people with eating disorders (as I am  pretty sure he has one, as much as he is not diagnosed) and I already do  alot of what is suggested. I very frequently tell him how proud I am of  him when he makes any progress, I tell him how handsome he is, I tell  him I love him, and I make sure he knows that I'm with him throughout  his struggles and i wont give up on him. He tells me about how much this  help but it's incredibly difficult for me when I see no actual  differnece in the way he is eating. He also obsessively counts calories,  and cant eat anythign without knowing how many calories are in it. Even  when he can only get a rough number, it stresses him out very much.  Seeing him do this to himself hurts alot and I cant really watch it.

He  went out to run a few miles today and I tried to get him not to as I  know it cannot be good to exert yourself when you havent been eating.  However he still did it and I am worried about him. He already has  issues with his body (ribs (from binding), back problems, and heart pain  as he was not getting heart checkup on a medication he was on, when he  was supposed to).

I never get  angry with him, as much as I feel it in Myself sometimes. I worry that  sometimes i come across as annoyed and stress him out more than i need  to, and i worry ahour that but cant really help it. i asked him and he  says that that's not true, and he only sees concern, which he  understands. however I dont know how true this is.

He  has experience in helping people with eating problems and always wants  to see them get better, and has acknowledged that if we were to swap  shoes, he would be very worried about me and would see it as a problem.  However he doesnt do the same for himself, and cant seem to. it makes me  very upset..

I find this very  difficult to cope with sometimes and it would be too much for me if I  didnt think he would get better. but seeing the positive effects I do  have on him mean the world to me and to see him get truly better one day  would mean more to me than anything else. i have already seen some  effects I've had and it makes me very happy. times like these are very  difficult though, and I dont know what to do. That's why I am here, to  ask for advice on how to deal with this. All I want to do is see him get  better, and not put a foot wrong by him.

I feel like I'm constantly at war with myself and can't quiet the ED voice. I have a meal plan and I skipped one of my snacks.

She is overweight and wants to lose weight and be healthier. In the beginning, she asked me for tips and stuff as I have been struggling to maintain healthy habits in my recovery which I happily oblige her in because I was genuinely excited that she wanted to take better care of her body. It started with me helping her build an exercise and nutrition regime that is sustainable and would feed her body well since she is vegan. The last thing I told her is to be kind to her body and herself because weightloss is not linear and her goal should be health and not a scale number. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, since we had to separate from COVID, it seems like she took the inch of my advice, tossed half, and ran a mile with the rest. Every week since December she tells me how much weight she lost and how much more she needs to lose, and what she ate for that day, and what she plans to eat. And the exercise and diet advice I gave? She does intense workouts daily and every week she has a new fad diet (juice diet, going keto, zero carb, fruits and veg only, etc) sending me pictures of her goal bodies, and gets upset if she doesn't lose as many lbs as she wanted for that week. She's lost a lot of weight since August and was livid because she only lost a few  lbs in January. I feel like this is all my fault. On one hand, I did encourage her in these habits and congratulated her as she was losing weight from being consistent but I didn't know that that was what she was doing until almost the end of December. 

I know since I'm in recovery for EDs that there's nothing you can say to someone in the throes of it that will change them, and they have to make that decision for themself, so I've been trying to get her to consider her health more than the scale number. I ask her to consider how she feels about and after the food she eats (or doesn't), I remind her that yo-yo dieting and fad diets are ineffective, I tell her to eat if she is hungry and listen to her body and eat, I tell her to focus on another benchmark than the scale, like an increase in stamina or better sleep or SOMETHING, but it seems like I won't be able to get through to her. The more she talks the more guilty I feel for starting this, and just her intense restrictions and how she talks about the food and her body image is so triggering to me I can't take it.

I don't want my friend to fall down the same hole I'm fighting every day to stay out of, but at this rate I might fall back into it trying to get her away. I don't want to push her away but when I try to tell her that her relationship with food and herself is becoming unhealthy she gets upset and changes the subject. I don't know what to say to her and I don't want to walk on eggshells when it comes to food and nutrition with her because it's a huge part of my life as a recreational athlete.

i lost a fair amount of weight from november 2019 to january 2020. not close to how much i wanted to lose, but i lost something.
ive always been an overeater. not knowing when to stop. i felt full, but since there was food in front of me, i ate. to the point of not being able to move and feeling tons of shame and disgust with myself.
i managed to maintain my weight in 2020 because of intermittent fasting. it helped me eat when i was hungry and not when i was bored or emotional.
however i stopped intermittent fasting when i was going through a hard time and turned to food for comfort. food has never been a necessity to survive for me, it was something i needed to feel good.
if i am awfully full, i dont want to leave the house. i refuse to leave the house unless my stomach feels completely empty, so it’s easier to suck in. and that’s where delaying my first day of school comes in..
i ate a lot this weekend because my friend came over for a sleepover... and school started yesterday. 
i felt so... fat... like i gained all the weight i lost in 2020. i dont want people to see me.

1602,EDPostRequests,1612209916,lacmcv,"Hi guys!
This story is not going to be applicable to everyone, but it may help some of you. 
TLDR; Had an ED (bulimia) for 8 years as a teenager, have struggled with weight since. Turns out I have ADHD. My mindset has changed COMPLETELY since.
I'm 37/F. I have struggled with my relationship with food for most of my life. At 9 I wrote in my diary that I thought I was fat and compared myself to other girls. From 13 - 22 I had bulimia, I went to counselling and worked through a lot of stuff. Though I didn't engage in such harmful behaviours any more since then there's always been this fixation.
In recent years I am pretty sure I would fall under the category of BED. My weight fluctuated all the time. It would start to go up and I'd be stressed but I always needed to be in what I thought of as ""the zone"" in order to start a diet. So I would start a diet and it would go SUPER well for 2 weeks, maybe 3, sometimes. But the struggle was immense. 
With diets even if they were going well I didn't seem to get the same dopamine kick as it continued. The initial high of my progress was not enough to encourage me to continue. I would start snacking more. My weight would start to go back up. Rinse and repeat. I felt like a constant failure. I thought there was something inherently weak in me. 
The thing I couldn't understand was how different it felt now to when I was a teenager and had an ED. As a teen I lacked self esteem and my ED was a way for me to cope with stress. As an adult, I'm actually very happy &amp; much more confident. I didn't understand why I had this ""need"" to snack all the time. 
In December last year I got diagnosed with ADHD. My oldest brother has ADHD and he told me 5 years ago he thought I might have it. I laughed and told him that was ridiculous. I compared myself to him and what I thought ADHD was. I was completely wrong. ADHD is much broader than the general public are led to believe and it also presents itself very differently in women. Women are much less likely to get a diagnosis than men because of it - most women being adults by the time they get it. 
People who have ADHD have much lower dopamine production the neurotypical people &amp; can often look for these dopamine kicks elsewhere. For me it was food &amp; especially sugary/carb rich food. 
Research indicates that adolescent females with ADHD are 3.6 times more likely to develop an ED and 5.6 times more likely to develop bulimia nervosa.
In conclusion I'm not trying to say that my ADHD caused the ED or that it was a magic cure but it's helped me to understand myself better &amp; thus begin to overcome once and for all this fixation with food. 
I would never in a million years have suspected that I have ADHD and statistically speaking there must be a small percent of you in here that also has it. 
If you relate to what I've said, and you don't have ADHD - that does NOT mean you're a failure. Having an ED is way of coping, it's a very real struggle. It's just a matter of finding out what exactly it is your struggling with. For me I was struggling with all the negative effects of ADHD but not understanding WHY.

1604,EDPostRequests,1612209008,lac92n,"My daughter is an 18f and I've started to notice a pattern with her eating. She eats a huge amount of food and then a bit later announces that she has to ""poop"". She then proceeds to the bathroom for awhile, then comes out with a red face and red knuckles saying she ""feels like she lost 2 pounds"".

Honestly, I wouldn't have thought anything of it if I hadn't noticed a pattern and  if I wasn't recovering from an ED myself. She's literally doing the exact same things I've done in the past and it breaks my heart. 

I'm a little concerned that my husband/her father might be exacerbating the issue, he's tall and eats more than what would be considered normal. I say this because I relapsed in the beginning of our relationship due to the fact that his love language is food. We had to make some not-so-easy adjustments but we've gotten to a healthy place where I'm able to stay balanced.

That being said, there is a thirteen year difference between me and my husband so I'm closer to my daughters age, but I'm at a total loss for how to approach the subject with either of them. When I was deep in my ED I didn't want to talk about it and I would lash out if anyone even broached the subject. 

I see myself in her and I don't want to cause more stress but I also don't want to pretend like everything is okay when it's clearly not.

I feel like I'm skating on thin ice and I'd really appreciate any thoughts on how I could possibly begin to approach this subject with her.

1605,EDPostRequests,1612180962,la1kwh,"So from 12 to 18 years old, I struggled. I had a friend who was anorexic and often hospitalised so our friendship, while we liked each other greatly, was toxic as we would just....  encourage each other. I almost got hospitalised for ED and other mental issues often, but always got away with it. I reached not to purge for a year, then at 17, relapsed. I had came out as trans and my mom didn't got it, school was stressful and so I purged. My mom caught me and told me she would hospitalised me if I kept doing it. It did work. 

Now at 22, I struggled, but I was overall ok. Still had a lot of comportements from that, but nothing as dangerous as it had been. I was proud. But then, lockdown. Before that, I would walk, climbed the 5 floors to my class and all so I would have a low weight, but not too low. But with the lockdown and more recently, the curfew, I started eating a lot more. I work in animation and would spend my days in front of my computer on works. Staying until 6 am, then going to sleep and waking up at 12 only to go to my computer until 6 to 8 am. 

During all this, I was also secretly going to appointment to start my transition as non-binary. I gained not that much of weight, really. I'm not even at my healthy weight, only a few pounds under, but it's the highest I've ever been and my chin is not so slim anymore. It scared me. Then when I got my ok to start T, I came out to my family and it didn't go well. They still misgender me (They/them, but we speak french and in french everything is gendered so I told them to be a neutral as possible or to use masculine pronouns) and my dysphoria got way worse. As well as my body image. 

I binge and binge and feel bad. I started exercising again and try to just have a healthier lifestyle as much as I could (I still do 1 to 3h of walking per day since the start of the lockdown), but these days, it's becoming more and more in my head.

I just start eating at typical mealtimes, and I eat in what feel like arbitrary quantities.

I stay at a healthy weight for some amount of time (currently four months) and then eventually things fall apart and it seems like I get into a frame of mind where I really want to eat. I find myself thinking about food all the time, mapping out in my mind what meals I am going to eat next. The last time this happened, coupled with a severe bout of depression, I ended up gaining about xx lbs (a significant amount) in 6 months. Typically, I would go to a restaurant and order a burger and an omelette for lunch. I started taking Wellbutrin and it has limited my compulsion. I lost the weight, but eating is still disconnected from hunger for me, and it seems like it would be very easy to get into a frame of mind where I would starting gaining weight very quickly again.

1610,EDPostRequests,1612150074,l9tn86,"so i (19F) have been roommates since last september with this girl (19) and we bonded instantly. we hang out almost everyday, play board games a lot, and watch tv. when i first moved in, i noticed a sign on her wall saying “eat x meals a day! idc if you’re not hungry” and i thought nothing of it considering i struggled with appetite loss the previous year of school due to poor mental health and i thought it was something along those lines. nothing serious right?

about a month into our friendship, i started to notice odd behavior. she would eat a snack, for example a smoothie, and then starve the rest of the day. i would ask if she wants to come eat with me or our friends and she would say she isn’t hungry or that she’s full. i’d ask her to come just to hang out while i get food if she doesn’t feel like eating. sometimes she’ll say no, sometimes she’ll say yes. it’s a gamble. there are rare times in which she will eat if she comes with me so i make a point to ask her to come. 

she works out excessively with resistance bands and weights and always makes comments about how her breasts/rear aren’t big enough, she’s not proportionate, and that she needs to get fit. we’re around the same weight- average for our age. (not that it matters, but idk if that’s something i should add).

there are days where she doesn’t want to be around anyone. she’ll shut down. sometimes she’ll go on walks or sit in her bed on her computer. if i tell her something to start a conversation, she’ll just say “uh huh” or “that’s good.” and if i ask her to hang out she’ll just say no

she has been exhibiting these behaviors for months now. i know she struggles with low self esteem and past trauma. her family and friends back home joke about how she doesn’t eat. it doesn’t seem to bother her though as she brings up the jokes to me and laughs about how they ‘called her out.’

anyways yesterday she ate something from the supermarket and it made her stomach hurt. she kept talking about how much she didn’t want it inside her anymore. she asked me if i knew of anything that could induce vomiting. i declined and said there’s no safe way to induce vomiting because the acid burns your throat either way. i went back in my room where our friends were and we continued our conversation. a bit later she goes to the bathroom with what looks like a spoon or a toothbrush and locks the door. my heart sunk and i tried to think about something else. until i heard it. it was violent and prolonged. my friends and i looked at each other and one of them mouthed to me asking if my roommate was okay. i said it’s fine. she came out of the bathroom a while later and was shut down and reserved for the rest of the night.

normally, she’ll lock herself in the bathroom for hours. sometimes 3-4 hours at a time and play music. i have no idea what she does. shes not always in a bad mood when she does this, it’s basically routine now. the bathroom is pretty acoustic so you can hear pretty much everything. but when she goes in, i only hear music. sometimes shuffling around. this time was different though. it was the only time i heard her purging

while we are close, our relationship isn’t at a stage where we can be completely vulnerable to each other. she’s opened up, i’ve opened up but it’s not super deep or raw emotion you know? and i know she hates exposing herself in that way. so bringing this behavior up is not something i have considered. however she did mention something once on a late night with one other friend. she said that she has a reason for not eating but then the subject was changed so it wasn’t much of a conversation. that’s why i think it might be an ED

i know it’s not my business, but i can’t help but feel torn up by this. she’s my friend and i love her a lot. i would hate to think i could’ve done something with the information ive analyzed. 

in high school i had a couple friends with ED. mostly restrictive eating and starving, and they’d claim it was dietary. back then, i left them alone. until i realized later that their behavior was indeed that of individuals with EDs. so i don’t want to be a bystander to this. i want to help. but i’m not sure how. 

ive brought up the fact that i go to our school’s therapy and i always talk to our group about how beneficial it is and how i believe everyone should go at least once since it’s free. i asked my roommate if she’d be interested and she was very apprehensive. recently, she told me she’s open to the idea but needs my help in signing up. i told her i could help with whatever she needs but she hasn’t brought it up since. should i offer it again?

her parents don’t know the extent of her behavior and neither do any of our friends. i don’t want to air out her business to the group. is there anything i can do that isn’t too pushy or prodding? or makes her distance herself from me? i want to do all i can, but i also want to respect her privacy",Request: i think my roommate/friend might have an ED. how should i approach?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/l9tn86/request_i_think_my_roommatefriend_might_have_an/,1612171674,31-01-21 21:27

This is the first time I understood it has a direct affect on my health. My mum noticed I should eat more and now she forces me to eat.

1621,EDPostRequests,1612050912,l8zah2,"My roommate has some strange behaviors, and this week it occurred to me that some of them might be indicative of disordered eating. I've been reading about ED, especially bulimia, and the resources for family and friends to ask/support those who are struggling. The problem is that I'm not sure if I'm reading way too much into things, and that we aren't close so it doesn't seem appropriate for me to offer support even if I notice more potential signs. 
When she first moved in, she said she has dietary restrictions and had been out of school for the last semester because of health issues. We assumed something like celiacs, IBS, etc. When we offered to include her in group dinners, one of my roommates asked what she needs to avoid and she said ""it's personal."" We dropped it and were confused but didn't want to press her. 
Why I think she might struggle with ED, and bulimia specifically:
- Regularly takes long showers, like at least 40 minutes, but up to 1 1/2 hours. I always thought it was odd but yesterday after dinner she took her second long shower of the day (the first one was after breakfast) and it rang a bell for me. 
- Only buys certain types of healthy foods, portions most things out on a scale, and writes caloric content + protein/fats on everything she freezes for later. *(QUESTION: Would this indicate restrictive eating or a recovery tactic to make sure she gets enough nutrients/doesn't binge?)
- Wears baggy shorts and jackets every day (I didn't read into this before but it was listed on several sites as a possible sign of ED)
- Newly clogged sink drain in the bathroom she uses (this happened soon after she moved in)
I haven't noticed any physical signs like bruised knuckles, red eyes, etc, and I don't share a bathroom with her. But now that I have read more, I will definitely be paying more attention. 

I feel like it's not my business at all, but I am definitely concerned. We are not close, partly because she's new to the apartment (we have made an effort to include her in things, but I don't know if she's that interested). Is there a point at which I should reach out, and if so, what should I say? I'd like to offer support or help her get help if she needs it, but it feels like complete overstepping. If I noticed any more signs, I was thinking I could leave her a note (rather than sitting her down and talking face-to-face) so that she could process it and ignore me if it is a boundary violation for me to ask.

I can stop looking at nutrition labels wherever I go now. I need my food to have exact measurements (so I constantly use measuring spoons in all my cooking) less or exact is fine but I never go over the serving size stated. I’ve looked up my TDEE and I’ve been trying to eat at my maintenance calories. Even without the app my brain automatically begins to mentally calculate how much I’ve eaten and totalling it up and I stop once I hit the limit for the day. When I eat out and I don’t have the exact calorie count for the food I’m eating I find myself googling the calorie counts of similar dishes on the internet, assuming the worst and taking the highest number and just running with it. At the same time, I’ve been trying to eat back my fear foods (like sugar and fast food) in an attempt to recover but it has ended up backfiring because whenever I’ve a craving for maybe a sweet (like cakes or tarts) I end up skipping a whole meal just to have enough calorie space for that one dessert. I think because of this I end up eating less than I should and I’m losing instead of gaining weight.

Basically my flatmate and I knew each other last year and she told me that she had previously struggled a lot with bulimia and anorexia but she was recovered. When we met she was a healthy weight, if anything a bit chubby but definitely not anorexic! We drank a lot and ate a lot, maybe going gym twice a week but we weren’t crazy. 

In lockdown we went home to our respective cities and families and we decided to come back after the cases went down a bit in the summer. She looked completely different. I know she had spent a lot of time on fitness but she was super skinny and I would barely have recognised her. Living together in the autumn she was obsessive about exercise. She would work out everyday and would always make sure to reach her daily calorie goals even if it meant going for a walk or run at 11pm. She eats okay I think, a lot of vegetables and not a lot of carbs, but she doesn’t really skip meals. It’s more the exercise I worry about. 

There was a short phase of maybe about a week where she told me she was PMSing, but she couldn’t keep down a meal and was throwing up every night.

Shortly after that she let slip that she thought that was a food issue but then wouldn’t speak about it. Pretty much straight after we went back to our cities for Christmas. 

Now we’re back again, and she’s arguably even more obsessed with exercise. I try not to calorie count in front of her, but I’m trying to put on weight as I have no muscle and sometimes the odd comment slips and she gets really upset with me. She’s much skinnier than me now and when she/I mention my own size she talks about me as if she’s still bigger, when she’s really not. 

She’s also told me that her family at home are very critical of her weight, and that worries me a lot. She’s bought a weighing scale she keeps in her room and she got a Fitbit for Christmas which is making her obsess over steps. 

I’m really wondering if over exercise is a problem and should I step in?

Today time slipped away from us a little, and she asked for lunch by the time she was already hungry. Here's where we had trouble: she didn't want anything in the house. She has some specific meals she likes to eat, and we were out of the ingredients to make any of them. I didn't want to drop everything to go pick up groceries, so I started listing foods we did have that I could make, which ended up causing her a lot of mental stress, and she ended up not eating.

How do I handle this better? If we don't have the food she wants, is it unhealthy for me to suggest something she doesn't like? Could I get some insight as to why that's so stressful for her, so I can understand it better?",Request: Help understanding partner with ED,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ln3y4o/request_help_understanding_partner_with_ed/,1613722251,18-02-21 20:10

So, uh, the doctor weighed me and measured me and gave me my BMI and stuff. I was there for mental health, obviously more stuff than just eating issues, and he said I wasn’t starving myself so I couldn’t have anorexia or anything. 

For the past year and a bit I’ve had issues with eating, I’ve tried to make it seem to myself as if xxxx kcal (high restriction) is good enough if I compulsively exercised it all off. Obviously I’ve not really lost a whole lot of weight. 

So when he said that, it was really the stick that broke the camels back and now suddenly I’m either fasting or eating up to xxx kcal (low restriction). 

I’ve already lost the highest amount you can healthily lose in 2 weeks in 4 days, and my next appointment is on the first of March. I’m obviously gonna lose more, but I need tips on how to make it seem as if I haven’t so he won’t tell my mum ✨

1658,EDPostRequests,1613692025,ln0y8f,"So, I've struggled with disordered/restrictive eating habits on-and-off for almost 6 years now. I've never been officially diagnosed, and I am currently at a healthy weight, so I don't look like the stereotype of a person struggling with food.

I moved into college last Sunday after doing the first part of my freshman year online from home. I've been here less than a week, and I'm pretty sure I'm not doing so hot. Because of COVID, all of our classes are online for the first two weeks, and so I haven't really made any friends other than my roommate. I'm too nervous to go to the dining hall, so I've been falling back into restriction really badly and barely eating at all. My roommate has invited me to go to the dining hall with her, but eating in front of other people gives me major anxiety, as does navigating the dining hall alone. I'm nervous about talking to a counselor (I tend to clam up when talking about stuff like this, and I don't even know where to go for an appointment), but I think I need help. I can already feel the brain fog affecting my classwork and I have a hard time sitting through lectures because I'm obsessing over food and my whole body hurts when I sit for too long. I can't go through an entire semester like this.

I don't really know my roommate that well, but she's the only one I've talked to on campus thus far. I have an RA who seems nice enough, but, again, I don't know her well-- I've only ever talked to her over Zoom or email. Talking to my parents is not an option for personal reasons, and medical withdrawal is out of the picture too, unless the school can force it.

I'm going home this Saturday and hopefully I can eat something with my family before I come back to school.

1659,EDPostRequests,1613647170,lmkjek,"I’m struggling with my weight and just appearance so much right now and I just don’t know what to do to fix this. If you have any advice or just anything to say about my vent pls lmk. (Most of the beginning stuff is not important, just me typing my mind)

I can’t remember since when but for a long time now my routine is to keep my room dark, brush my teeth in the dark, avoid mirrors, quickly unfocus my eyes to avoid seeing my reflection. I just never liked looking at myself because I would become hyper focused on why I looked so bad and it would just ruin my mood and be on my mind. And for a while it was mainly to the fact that I just thought I looked really bad.

Now before covid, I used to participate in a sport that I had done for 6 years of my life. It was a very big part of my life. I loved it for the fact that it was fun and also kept me in shape. And even though I was relatively fit I still thought that I was bigger than others, and honestly now I can’t tell if I was or wasn’t. However, back then it wasn’t this haunting thing always on my mind. Like it was more I’d look in the mirror and just be like damn why do I look so bloated. 

Then it got into junior year and I started to fall into a sadness, I hated school, I hated life, I hated working out. I stopped going to our team practices and had an abundance of free time that I spent sleeping. And i really don’t know from when, but I just started to limit what I was eating. And it was quite easy to do at school. I would “forget” to bring a lunch to school, and if someone offered me a snack I denied because I HATEd eating in front of others (altho this has been a thin for a while that I’ve learned to get over, since middle school idky I just thought I looked really bad when eating in front of others). And then I would go home and sleep for hours which made me skip dinner and then repeat process. (Obviously I ate at some point during the day so I could do stuff but it would just be like a couple grapes or drink some smoothie). And I would obsessively weight myself to make sure I was either lower than or losing weight compared to what I wanted to be. It got so bad to a point where I would sometimes force myself to throw up (im glad I haven’t done that in a long time tho). However, even tho I had body issues I was still comfortable in maybe going to the beach in a bathing suit or wearing a skirt (but the exception to this was that I wore a jacket to school everyday since elementary). 

When quarantine started I was obviously forced to stay home and I had to quit my sport. In the beginning I tried to keep up by going on bike rides and whatever. But I quickly lost any motivation for anything, including being active. It has literally become worse to the point where I eat like im still an athlete but sit in bed all day. I will definitely get the motivation to work out sometimes tho. But my self consciousness about my body has gotten to an unbearable point where I just don’t even know what to do.

I can literally feel all my skin and the weight I’ve gained and it makes me want to crawl out of my body or sit in a ball on the floor. I really don’t know how to explain the feeling but its like I can FEEL my face and just the weight I’ve gained on it. I always suck in and bite my cheeks to try and make it go away but that is NOT working very well. And just when I stand up I feel like I can feel my whole body and the weight which is something that I wasn’t aware of before I think. Like I literally hate sitting or standing or anything because I can feel my stomach and thighs if that makes sense. And whenever I eat it just gets worse and I feel guilt for making myself feel worse. Its literally an internal fight, my mind will say don’t eat those wafers but my mind will also be like eat them. So then Im eating them and I still have two voices in my head saying “stop stop"" and another is like “you have to finish them.” And then after I just feel like I’ve gained a bunch of weight and I can feel it everywhere. And when I get the small motivation to workout I put it off for so long because then I have to change my clothes and like actually look at myself. When I eat I just wear a jacket because it helps me not “feel” my body as much if that makes sense. I’ll literally look into the mirror sometimes and I CANT tell if im relatively thinner or just not. I can not tell. Like I really don’t know if I have a fat face or just regular, but it sure as hell doesn’t feel normal. Now, the thought of just seeing someone from school and they just see me now… makes me want to wear a full hazmat suit everywhere so im just not perceived.  I hope someone gets what im saying because I really hate this feeling. 

And I have been to a doctor and therapist before for reasons relating to mental health but not really this. Didn’t get very far tho. And im not sure if this is the right place to post this, I have not been diagnosed w a ED. I just issues

TW - relapse

Hi all

I  have been in recovery from anorexia which went well as I managed to  reach a healthy BMI. Since reaching that weight, I’ve turned to bulimia  in order to try to ‘undo’ the food ate if the meal was a bit large or  some fear foods.

I tried to stop  when my BF moved in with me in March. Living with someone else combined  with weekly therapy, I was doing pretty well up until this January 2021  lockdown.

Since the new year, I  have reverted back to behaviours as bad as before if not worse and I  cannot seem to keep anything down that isn’t a vegetable or fruit.

I  was wondering if anyone had experienced this (ie doing well for a bit,  to go back to being worse) and if anyone successful in recovery had any  tips? Would eating the same foods (ie safer foods) to get back on track  until I am not making myself sick as often help?

I plan on continuing therapy and doing better I just feel like I’m hitting a road block right now.

""Summary: Do people think it's a good idea to teach 9-year-olds about eating disorders? Any advice on how to go about doing that?



Hi,

I don't have personal experience with an eating disorder (although I do with depression and self harm) but I am a leader of a Cub Scout pack (boys and girls age 8-11) and we are doing the global issues badge with them.

Point 1 on the badge is to 'take part in an awareness day or week' and I thought the best option of those coming up might be eating disorder awareness week on march 1-7 (in the UK).

So my question is, do people think it's a good idea to teach 9-year-olds about eating disorders?

It seemed to me intuitively clear that we should be talking about eating disorders, like all mental health issues, more from a young age, as we do with physical illnesses and so they could identify it developing more easily.

My only worry is that, for example, I know personally that after finding out some of my friends self-harmed I felt a lot more likely to do it myself aged about 15, and even now seeing self harm makes me more inclined towards doing it again. Is this a risk with discussing eating disorders?

I do realise that eating disorders are different to self harm and can maybe be better compared to depression, in which case discussion definitely doesn't make you more likely to get it. Also discussion can be dramatising or it can be educational.

We wouldn't go into much detail, maybe a ten minute session in which we explain briefly the most common eating disorders, how to spot it (and that someone might not have those symptoms) and how to get help. We might ask them to notice how they feel about the food they are eating over the next week and discuss that in the next meeting.

My aim is to make them aware so that stigma is removed and they can identify symptoms in themselves (and others) earlier.

So any advice on how to best go about teaching children about eating disorders is welcomed. :-)

&amp;#x200B;

 Although  my sister has been concerned about her weight for as long as I can  remember, about two years ago she started taking weight loss supplements  extensively, going to the gym twice a day and started taking drugs  (cocaine, Adderall, etc.,) for obvious reasons (to keep energy high,  stave off hunger). Taking drugs so frequently resulted in a drug-induced  psychoses where she was admitted multiple times to the hospital due to  schizophrenic episodes. She was talking to people that weren't there,  specifically talking to Stef Shep who was one of the people in her head  (a well known COO for Kardashian's). The voice in her head was telling  her that she needed to get lip injections, lose weight, etc etc to fit a  beauty standard or else she would be ugly forever and die. She is  currently in recovery while living with my mum and step-father, and is  taking an antipsychotic to level her out after basically destroying her  brain from all the heavy drug use. Currently, she will drink 3-4 coffees  throughout the day without eating, pick at a bunch of snacks, and then  go directly to the toilet where she'll purge which is obvious to my  family because doesn't clean out toilet bowl after throwing up and is  very loud. 

It is obvious from the above that she has multiple mental  health issues, but my family and I believe that the overall problem  stems from body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. The medication she's  on projects that she's supposed to gain a significant amount of weight,  and every day she wakes up saying that her quality of life would be so  much better if she wasn't on it because of the weight gain. That being  said, when she first started the medication she was about xx pounds (very low) and  her thick dark hair was falling out in chunks due to lack of nutrition.  Before the medication, she was barely living, and remembers almost  nothing from the two years of her constant drug usage. 

Last night, my  mum, my oldest sister and I sat her down and tried to talk to her about  her ED. In the nicest way possible we tried to tell her that, without  addressing this overall issue, she is not going to be able to live a  healthy, normal life because she's clearly in a cyclical thought process  were all she can think about is weight gain. She was hugely resistant  and told us that we're stupid and don't know what we're talking about.  She kept harping on the fact that she cannot live the way she is because  of all the weight she's gaining (keep in mind that the medication she's  on, yes is supposed to make her gain weight, but she was extremely  under weight when she began to take it). 

We're at a complete loss. We  don't know how to convince her to get help, and she's so far down the  rabbit hole that she can't hear what we're saying and that we just want  to help her.

However, this past week I was unable to ""stick to my plan"" and deal with the hunger that comes with losing weight, and ended up eating way over my ""plan"".

I lost a significant amount of weight back in october/november and couldn't hold food down for weeks after an intense restriction relapse. 

At this point I feel like my body is rejecting nutrients and I panic every day/night because I'm afraid I'm not getting enough calories in. I'm in a lot of physical pain because i'm quite literally starving but can't seem to eat to save my life. It's not like I want to restrict anymore but I've lost my appetite and I've also been too fatigued to cook. I find myself crying and freaking out at the end of the day when I realize I've had nothing to eat and the only food in my house is ""junk"".

I don't eat the junk and at first it was because I was afraid of gaining weight but now I'm afraid of hurting my body with bad food since i'm already malnourished. I'm assuming the overlap of my ED and OCD is what's causing the health anxiety but I genuinely just want to eat healthily. 

Last year I became super self aware of my disorder and now that I'm a little more clear headed I feel like I ruined my body and I can never be ""normal"" again. My digestive system is completely fucked, my face has changed, i'm SO exhausted doing the bare minimum, breathing is hard, etc. Whenever I do eat i'm so bloated and all the weight goes to places I don't want it to go.

1676,EDPostRequests,1613319955,ljrhz2,"Hey everyone,

So currently I'm at a healthy weight, but about a year ago I was overweight, and a few pounds away from being obese. I was dating a girl who continually would make fun of me and put me down for my weight, which made me very self conscious. I knew I wasn't at a very healthy weight, but I was happy with myself and how I looked. Since then I've lost a bunch of weight, mostly in quarantine, just by eating less. I haven't been working out or even eating healthy, but I cut the amount of calories I consumed per day by at least half. 

However, as I have continued to lose weight, it's become harder to lose weight while consuming the same amount of calories, because my TDEE is going down. As this has happened, I've started to notice that I have a lot of habits that aren't very healthy. I probably check my weight at least 10 times a day. First thing when I wake up, immediately before and after I eat, and some random times throughout the day. I get pretty upset with myself whenever I see the scale go up at all. For example, I had some pasta today, and when I weighed myself after eating and saw that I gained 3 pounds, I was really disappointing. I *know* that it's just water weight, but I can't listen to that rational part of my brain.

I still don't eat particularly healthy food (though it isn't that bad), but I only have around 1 meal and 1-2 snacks per day and count all of my calories. I wouldn't say that eating the unhealthy food makes me guilty, because I love eating, and it makes me feel good to eat. When I go over one day, I usually restrict myself to only having one meal the next or even just a small snack.

I feel like this isn't healthy, but I don't really know what to do. Since I'm at a healthy weight, I'm too scared to just eat more cause I feel like that will make me just want to eat more again. There are times, and they're becoming more often, where I wish I was underweight so that I could eat more without feeling bad about any of it. I still worry with that too though, because I tell myself the same thing for every more 5 or 10 pounds that I lose, but I can't ever control myself and get myself to stop caring.",Request: Is this an eating disorder?

Anyways, gradually and unconsciously lost weight restricting for awhile, then had a pretty bad relapse last year losing too much weight too fast so that I got sick and had to be treated for acetonemia. Doctors said I couldve fallen into a coma. Was basically forced into recovery after and gained back the same 66 lbs that I had lost (which still put me at a slightly overweight BMI).

Recovery didnt last long, about 2 months or so, then had another relapse due to a stressful job. Have now lost 66 lbs again, am so fucking hungry all the time, and am wondering how Im supposed to keep up with uni work as it's gotten super hard to concentrate and memorize stuff. I basically binge once a week, then fast the rest and am losing about 2 lbs a week. Been doing this bc it makes me lose at an okay pace and also used to help with concentration. Didnt want to fuck up my body too much, and I could at least somewhat okayishly concentrate and do stuff the first 3 days or so after a binge. Anyways, this has changed, it's like my body has hit its own personal brick wall, and Im feeling miserable.

Problem is I just realized I can't stop. This might sound extremely stupid, but when I relapsed, I genuinely thought Id be safe this time and that I have everything under control, Im not as bad mentally as when I first got sick blabla. But seems like I am. Two days ago, I used lax for the first time ever to get rid of food and feel empty again, not even for BM issues. I had vowed to myself never to use lax as that is just extremely dangerous and can cause permanent damage, and I still did it. And even though Im scared of the consequences, I know I'll probably do it again next time Im in the same situation. 

Tried to say fuck it and attempt recovery today, had a meal and -- panic. Result: Made myself throw up again for the first time in 3 years. This is officially my worst relapse since I developed my ED bc Im genuinely feeling out of control again. Im scared of failing academically because of this. Im scared of losing my friends. Im scared of lax addiction. But Im also scared of weight gain and feel like I wont ever truly recover until Im the weight I was during that one time when one of my recovery attempts were truly successful. And that's still about 40 lbs from now. Im just barely holding my shit together.

I have struggled with mostly restricting and binging cycles since I was 9. I was in recovery for the last few years. I have always been either a “healthy” weight or slightly overweight but I guess because of the shape of my body I don’t really look overweight but I am clearly on the curvy/chubby side (am I allowed to say that here? Remove if not!). I say this because basically it’s not easy for people around me to notice when I’m restricting because they see both weight loss and weight gain as socially acceptable for my weight and body type, if that makes sense. I also have body dysmorphia. I’m a woman btw.

Last summer my wife of 7 years who knows about my history basically got into a bit of an argument with me where she asked me to lose weight. I had gained a bit over the years and the pandemic but when I was thinking healthily I didn’t think it was noticeable to anyone except me. I was really shocked that she said that as she’s always been extremely complimentary about my body before. She is very athletic and slightly underweight by BMI and said I could be more like her if I ate more like her and exercised more. I was really upset and went for a walk and when I came back she was crying and apologized a lot and never mentioned it again so I forgave her. However the seed was planted and I started to have more issues with food than I had in a long time and obsessing and trying to lose weight. I actually did lose some but she didn’t mention it or notice anything was up.

Around this time she started hanging out with a friend of ours a lot more. Something about the friendship felt off to me but my wife said I was being jealous and imagining it. They would go out skating and come back to our house and sometimes sort of preen and compliment their own bodies, like pointing out their leg muscles etc. This friend has a very conventionally attractive slim body and I couldn’t stop comparing myself to her and feeling jealous, but I didn’t say anything out loud. The friend also made a couple of comments to me that I really think were meant to be insults about my body but subtle enough that my wife didn’t pick up on them.

Well, fast forward to December. My wife left me very suddenly and then confessed she had feelings for the friend. She cut her off and said she would never see her again. She spent January making me think we were going to reconcile and then I found out she had been with the friend the entire time. Since I found out she stopped speaking to me.

I am really struggling. I can’t stop thinking that I had been thinner she wouldn’t have left me. She didn’t even really seem to like this person that much and would complain about her personality often, I suspect it is largely a physical attraction. I am having literally constant intrusive thoughts about my ex-friends body and my wife admiring it so much more than mine. I keep picturing them laughing about how ugly I am together.

It’s the worst when I’m trying to eat or buy groceries. But then other times I cave and eat something really unhealthy and then have a meltdown over it. I know we’re not supposed to talk about numbers but I have lost a significant amount of weight since she left. Weight loss is all I can focus on. I know it’s not healthy but at the same time I like my body so much more the more weight I lose so it motivates me to keep going. I’m so hungry right now because I had a bad breakfast and lunch and skipped dinner and I am just so tired and I feel horrible. I miss my wife so so badly and I can’t shake off the feeling that I fucked up my whole life by being too big.

People often recommend food diaries or calorie counting. But calorie counting is highly triggering, since I see it as a competition with myself to go low as possible.

I have suffered with restrictive eating patterns and bulimia in the past and do not consider myself recovered yet as I occasionally will purge and still suffer with body hatred.

I went vegan January 2020 for veganuary which many people in my life questioned at the time. I have been vegan ever since. When asked about my reasons I give some vague answer on the environment but in reality I don’t think veganism is the answer to environmental issues (trendy vegan food is often imported and contributes to pollution that way). I don’t like animals so people know that it’s not a moral reason. I know my only reason for being vegan is to restrict.

Being vegan means I have a reason to say no to certain foods. I can check nutritional information without being questioned. Eating out means I have to choose the healthier vegan options. 

I want to stop but I’m now grossed out by any animal product. The thought of having an egg makes me sick.

I apologize if this question is out of line. Or if there is too much info.

I had been at a healthy weight for \~3 years but the last year was  extremely difficult. My metabolism slowed due to a medication I was  taking and I had an ectopic pregnancy that required emergency surgery. I  fled a scary abusive relationship a few months ago and my ex has been  kind of stalking me. I feel anxious all the time. As a result I guess my  ED seems to have come back. In a short time I know I have lost weight  and I have been getting all sorts of infections and losing hair. I see a  psychiatrist regularly for ptsd/anxiety/depression but he doesn't seem  to take my ED stuff seriously. I am seeing an internal medicine doctor  in two days to follow up on a recent infection and I want to tell them  I've never experienced nausea so intense and I need help getting  nutrients again because I don't want to live like this.

I'll try to make this  short: been together for 8 years, got married last August. I always had  the impression that she sometimes ate huge amounts of food, and I knew  she had a bulimic phase when she was younger. A few weeks before our  marriage date, on a vacation, I suddenly realized that she made herself  throw up almost every day. She almost would not admit it even though it  was blatantly obvious as we were in a small hotel room together. I was  shocked and of course questioning the past &amp; asking myself if I had  overlooked this all those years, but she swore that, seeing how much it  affected me, she'd stop doing it. She didn't really see an issue, said  she just wanted to be thinner. I believed her and we got married as  planned. Maybe that was naive... since then, she has started a new  ""diet"" because she has digestion problems. She was told to leave out all  sugar, the only thing allowed is a bit of dark chocolate. Now she's  eating mainly vegetables, plus a huge amount of dark chocolate (about  two bars every day,). Not surprisingly she gained weight from  that diet, which is probably what made her throw up again in the last  two weeks (that's at least what I'm convinced of, all the signs &amp;  noises are there). Now I try to be supportive &amp; understanding, but  she flat out denies everything, calls me paranoid and obsessed and that  she hasn't ""done anything"" since last summer. On the other hand she is  making general remarks how she cannot understand that other people find  it disgusting or see any problem at all with bulimic behaviour.  Now what do I do? I understand this is a difficult disease, and I'm  absolutely willing to help her, but if I'm made to feel like a bad  person who is just making things up and doesn't trust her, I'm kind of  at the end of my wits. I've told her countless times that I wouldn't  judge her if she did throw up and that I'd be here to help but again,  she says it's all in my head. To me this is gaslighting, pure and  simple, and it's not something that a partner should do.

Hey so im writing here cause i cant  discuss it with anyone else and im afraid they might tell my parents and  tell them that i need help. Okay so this has been going on for about a  year and i was obese last year in feb but then i started  restricting my diet to eating just dinner which would be no more than  xx calories (very low). Back then my parents wont care as they just thought i was  dieting to lose weight and I’ll stop when i get to my ideal weight but  over the course of one year I’ve reached yy kg which is normal weight for  my height and age. But i still cant get myself to feel comfortable and  eat more than xx calories (very low) now and if i feel like I’ve eaten even just a bit more  than that , i would go and purge out the food.  Back in November i purged regularly for about 20 days then stopped for a  week then started again and now its on and off now. I got covid in  January and felt guilty for not being able to purge as i was on  medications and purging would take them out as well. I check my weight  everyday and if i lose one kg then the day goes good but if the weighing  scale shows the same number or worse that it has risen it makes my  whole day shit.

First, I just want to say I may not be the most educated about eating disorders so it would be great if any of you could help me understand and distinguish binge eating vs over eating. 

One of my friends has a binge eating disorder, and when listing all the foods eaten in a typical binge episode, I realized I occasionally eat more than my friend does in a binge episode. And it got me thinking, do I have an eating disorder? I understand it’s not about quantity, but about the mentality and cause behind it ...

But I realized I feel extremely guilty after eating a lot, am always self conscious of how I look, and I sometime eat until I’m uncomfortably full, so much that my tummy feels bruised on occasion. 

However, I’m not really sure if it interrupts my daily life and I don’t feel like I eat emotionally/there is no reason to eat a lot? I usually out of nowhere just get a really big urge to eat, and I feel like I enjoy it in the moment, but can’t control myself to stop eating, and when I finally do stop, I’m already too uncomfortably full. This could be alone or in social settings (it may actually happen more in social setting for me) And later feel really guilty - feel a need to exercise, but sometimes I get too lazy and continue to feel guilty. I get over it after the next couple days until I eat a lot again, feel guilty &amp; self conscious, etc

Hi everyone. I’ve struggled with  weight/body image since I was a child, and the possibility of me  struggling with an ED is something I’ve been seriously considering  lately. I am currently overweight, have struggled with resistance to  weight loss and difficulty building muscle for a few years, and wonder  if under-eating might be an underlying and lifelong issue? If so, I’m  questioning if the root could be an ED.

Some  backstory: My mom had an extremely unhealthy relationship with food  (still does) and I was often roped into it. I was a healthy weight as a  child and young teen, but I struggled with distorted body image due to  her dieting/self talk and her attitude toward my own eating. Up until  the time I was in high school I always had to ask for permission to eat,  and even then there was constant commentary on my choices/judgement  about how I shouldn’t be hungry/etc. If I even went into the kitchen I  would immediately be questioned. She had me in WW with her when I was  12. I developed deep shame about my own body, fear of certain foods, and  rebellious eating/binging tendencies as a result of this dynamic. For  example, I would often eat anything I could get my hands on when she  wasn’t home, try to hide wrappers, make it look like I hadn’t eaten  anything. I never purged. In retrospect I wonder if this binging was out  of genuine hunger?

As I got older  I gained and gained weight. As a late teen this led to intentionally  eating less because I felt guilty about eating due to my increasing  weight. I never ate breakfast in high school and regularly didn’t feel  hungry throughout the day. This was completely normalized to me.

I  am 29 now. I have made massive strides in my mental/emotional  relationship with my body and food, but I do not think that I know how  to properly feed my body. I no longer limit or fear certain food groups,  but I still struggle with not feeling hungry and skipping meals as a  result. I often get nauseous if I try to eat before noon. I regularly  don’t eat until 3pm. More often than not when I finally do eat I get  full quickly or experience uncomfortable indigestion that keeps me from  eating more. I don’t track anything, but I know there’s no way I’m  eating enough to fuel my body properly. I question whether chronic  under-eating has contributed to the weight gain and other symptoms I am  struggling to control (insomnia, depression, fatigue, etc).

My  current PCP is heavily suggesting a restrictive diet for weight loss  and I am worried this would make things worse. They have conducted  numerous tests and there is ‘nothing wrong with me’, so my weight is  being looked at as the main issue. I’m feeling incredibly overwhelmed. I  don’t know if what I experience can be categorized as an ED, and if so,  what are my options for learning to navigate/heal from this with  professional guidance?",Request: Seeking advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/lq52s4/request_seeking_advice/,1614063525,22-02-21 18:58

I'm not sure if I have an eating disorder, and, if I do, what it falls under. I am type two diabetic but I am dependent on long acting and short acting insulin. Every time I eat, I binge to the point where I feel extremely physically sick. The binge is a result of my sugar levels skyrocketing, which makes me feel like I need to eat more even though my stomach can't take it. It is also due to own mental state because eating comforts me when I am dealing with an especially bad depression/anxiety episode. I don't trust myself to eat and not binge, which is why I fast for basically 40+ hours at a time. My parents and sister are getting frustrated with me because I skip a lot of meals and when I don't, I binge. Honestly, a lot of the times I want to purge but I can't because my mom has OCD and me vomiting in our only bathroom would trigger her.

I've been missing a lot of appointments with my diabetes doctor because i'm too ashamed and scared about what they say. I don't check my blood sugars after the binge and I don't give myself insulin before then. I ""estimate"" how much insulin I have to give myself afterwards (and give myself at least 40 units of the short acting insulin) because I'm too scared to check my blood meter.

Also I am in no way  encouraging disordered eating. I am simply explaining my story with  eating. Moving forward, I have been underweight my whole life even as a  kid. The only time I was at a healthy weight (still on the lower end of a  healthy BMI) was when I first got braces in high school and during my  first year of college (maybe because of an environment change idk) but  then I started losing weight again. The thing is, I don't ever feel  hungry. I usually only feel hungry once or twice a day, and whatever I  eat keeps me going. I know it's not healthy nor is it normal, but I'm  not sure what it is. I have had IBS since I was a kid so maybe that's  why? I just get full so easily. I do know that both of my parents were  the same exact way as me when they were younger so maybe its a genetic  thing. They're both really healthy (in terms of weight) now though. I am  not dangerously underweight either. 

During high school I did have body  image issues and would check my weight constantly. I'm not sure what  changed for me to get over it (or maybe I didn't even get over it and  its still subconsciously impacting me). However, now I rarely ever check  (maybe like once a week or every two weeks). I've always been like  this, but now more people are commenting on it and I'm beginning to feel  insecure. For example, my boyfriend and some of my friends will not  stop bothering me about eating food. It really upsets me because  I  don't like being forced to eat. .  I have gone to the doctors several times for checkups and  everything is completely normal (blood tests, checkups etc.) EXCEPT for  the fact that I am underweight for my height and my IBS so I do avoid  certain foods.  I'm not sure what is is, but I'm beginning to get  worried. Another thing is that I do not have a bad relationship with  food nor do I hate food. If I am hungry, I will eat. It's just that I do  not think about food as much and I'm not hungry a lot of the time.

in high school i was on a medication  that make me gain a considerable amount of weight, i had no idea i was  noticeably bigger until i got off it, i started restricting my meals,  starving myself for days, making myself throw up after meals, it’s so  hard to talk about because i am male and there just so much stigma and  judgment about boys doing that, obviously i don’t think there should be  and i would love it if there wasn’t, i always see everywhere on articles  and people talking about it using words like “her” and “she” and i just  feel so discouraged to ask for help. it was never diagnosed but i never  even told anyone, it was obvious but not one asked, i had one friend  that knew, it was just an unspoken thing, they would always encourage me  to eat so i appreciated that a lot. i would got told “you look so good  now!” and “why are your hands so boney” my hands, feet, shoulders, head  were all so boney and looked out of proportion. ones positive and ones  negative so it just shows how delicate and sensitive this can be because  both of those things definitely made it worse, i felt like “you look so  good” meant i was on the right track and i should keep going and the  “why are you so boney” made me feel embarrassed and i don’t know why but  it just made me so much more upset. Anyway i definitely do not have  those behaviours now but i think i subconsciously  scared to get to a  bigger weight again, i’m not actively going out of my way to constrict  my eating but i am stuck in the habits that i had when i was doing it, i  don’t have a motive or a goal like losing weight so i don’t believe  it’s still there but i still am only eating one meal a day sometimes  nothing at all, i don’t get hungry and i really only eat if something is  put in front of me or when i am really craving something. my stomach is  so small i will have a few bites of something and i’m full. i feel so  embarrassed and ashamed even talking about this i’ve never told anyone.

So I just wanna make one thing clear: this is not about my weight or health. Most eating disorders I know of have something to do with appearances or physical health, but this isn’t like that, which is why I’m kinda confused. Also sorry for bad formatting, I’m on mobile.

Ok so I’m not looking for a diagnosis, and I’m going to a doctor soon, and he’ll probably know best, but I’m just impatient and want to see if I can find out what types of things to expect? So this might be a plain way of saying this, but I don’t like eating. Even when it’s something I really like it’s generally not enjoyable. This has been a thing since I can remember, and I’m only now realizing how dangerous this can be since it’s gotten worse now that I’m not being fed by my parents every day (I’m almost 17 btw). I’ve always felt sick during and after meals and snacks, especially in the mornings. I don’t really feel hungry, like my stomach doesn’t hurt, I don’t get headaches or feel dizzy. I only realize I haven’t eaten for an entire day when someone talks about eating, and even then I’m reluctant to get anything more than a snack. I’m not sure if this is the cause, since like I said it’s been going on since I was little, but a couple of years back I ended up in the hospital cause I went three days without eating cause I was irrationally afraid I was gonna puke if I ate anything, and I barely drank anything. They just got my super high on all these meds and got me to eat some crackers and apple slices, and then discharged me the same day. For about a week or two after that I ate very little, and it got worse after that, like my fear of throwing up got worse, whenever I got nervous in general it got worse, and all of this has been exaggerated by doing school during the quarantine.

I’ve noticed over the year, like a lot of girls in their early 20’s, she talks about dieting or exercise or wanting to look a certain way sometimes (very thin; not skeletal but still quite thin). She’ll sometimes compare herself unfavorably to me, which makes me uncomfortable and I also think she’s in fantastic shape. 

(TW) What makes me nervous is I have noticed on several occasions that she can make herself throw up seemingly at will, and she can do so silently. Maybe I’m wrong, but that seems like a niche skill to have. I have seen her do it several times, and I have also noticed she frequently uses the bathroom very soon after meals, and the timing is just slightly off...

I have also had an ED in the past, so I feel like I may just be sensitive to certain habits. I can’t tell if I’m being sensitive and nothings wrong or if I’m picking up cues others aren’t getting.

I’m not sure if I should confront her or not. I know she’s in therapy for other things, and it’s possible she’s already addressing this issue (if it’s an issue).

I restricted for a long time, like 2-3 years. I used to exercise but I had a surgery (which was ""good"" for me.

After the surgery I did not work out for a good 6 months.

Started to work out again, 4x per week, and upping my calories by 50 every 2 weeks.. (currently 150 more) Because Im scared of weight gain. And it happened, not that much, but after 1 month of bodyweight workouts and reverse diet, I gained 1 kg. yeh. Bloating all the time. My stomach was my skinniest part of my body,  that's why it bothers me so much. Thinking about restricting again and forgetting about the reverse diet because Im scared. Don't know if it's initial weight gain or water weight because of muscle soreness etc.. But you know, it's a terrible feeling, and I see myself 5 times bigger now than before when I carried more weight. My lower stomach is the main problem, it's big and hard.

I developed a binge eating disorder in middle school.

I would binge eat to try and gain a sense of control/ward off negative emotions. I only gained more weight. I felt worse. Cycle continued.

I got to high school and aged out of my pediatrician. Instead of someone who’d condescendingly mention I needed to lose weight, this doctor listened to my problems and diagnosed me properly. Helped me get connected with a psychiatrist and get the treatment I needed. By college I was an athlete.

But I’ve never had an especially healthy relationship with food. Even when at a healthy weight and not experiencing an ED symptoms, every meal choice requires a lot of intentionally to avoid binging or restricting.

I recently had an unrelated surgery and I had to fast for a week afterwards while things healed.

Every time I start trying to reincorporate normal meals I either binge like the world is going to end tomorrow, or I go totally inappropriate stretches of time without eating (for every unhealthy reason I used to, but now especially, for fear of binging.)

Has anyone else ever experienced this and do they have a recommendation for how I get back into the swing of things? I cannot break this cycle no matter what I try.

1740,EDPostRequests,1614726154,lwf0n6,"Hello!

These days I'm asking myself a lot of questions about if I am recovered from anorexia or not. 
But first, a bit of background story so you can understand from where I'm coming from. I have been diagnosed with anorexia 5 years ago but it started at least 2 years before that (prior to that I had bad habits and thoughts which in my opinion helped to develop an ED). Around 2 years ago I stopped meeting my therapist at the ED ward because my weight and BMI was really stable and she thought I didn't need it anymore. I've never been hospitalized and my periods never stopped because I've always managed to keep a stable weight right above the limit: I wanted them to leave me alone so I lied and it eventually worked.

So I stopped getting help and started recovery alone. Because I've never been honest with my therapist and had to do this journey alone, I kept a lot of ED habits (like sorting my food and not drinking alcohol because of being afraid to lose control. Or not being interested in any form of physical relationship even though I am now a young adult). My weight is still stable, near healthy but still underweight. I eat a bit of everything including non healthy foods, don't calorie count, don't exercise etc.. and I don't think that most people know I have/am recovering from anorexia.
But even though I sometimes think I am now fine, I am still terrorized of gaining weight and losing control. As soon as I reach an healthy weight (which is still not healthy let's be honest) I panic. I cry, hit and hate myself. When I am angry or sad, I relapse for a few days and then comeback to healthy eating habits.

Do you think I am recovered or still recovering ? All of my family thinks that I recovered but I'm not too sure, I feel like an imposture just like the way I used to be in denial when I got diagnosed (and the way I still often am in denial). But I also often wonder if I'm not just trying to clinge to my ED because it became a part of my identity: it started when I was a teenager and now that I am a young adult, I don't know who I am if I'm not anorexic. I don't know how I am supposed to act, I missed most things teenagers experience because of this illness like first relationship, date, first kiss or even being drunk. I often feel like if I fully recover, I won't be me and I won't be special even though I know I can't and will never be back to the way I was when I was 15: it's impossible. I'm so afraid and I wish I could talk about it to someone.",Request: Am I recovered or still recovering ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/lwf0n6/request_am_i_recovered_or_still_recovering/,1614747754,02-03-21 17:02

When I myself, was a child, I stumbled across many people who called me fat and made fun of my weight. I always felt ashamed and upset, because kids my age were all skinny and small, while I was an overweight child. It was always common for someone to nitpick my weight.

A few more years later, (not now though) I was at a healthy weight, but still looked a little chubby. I did look skinner than my kid self, but I would still be considered a bit overweight, at least if you compare me to many of the kids around me. Later, I developed an eating disorder and obsessively tried to lose weight because of those comments from when I was younger, and because of all the kids my age that still weighed way less than me, which made me feel very uncomfortable about me, and my body. It worked, and I was very underweight for months, still letting those comments from other people define me.

In present time, which is now, I recovered, and stand at a healthy weight. But, sometimes, those terrible comments in my childhood that were calling me overweight is still stuck with me bothering me to this day. I sometimes think negatively about my body and letting those past comments get to me. It’s difficult to not think about those fat shaming comments, when they were said so often as a child. I don’t want to develop another eating disorder, I just want to be free from having bad thoughts about my body. But, these insults/comments I faced about my body aren’t leaving my head.

So how do I not listen to any more comments involving my body even after an eating disorder recovery? I just want to live a happy life where I don’t care about those rude remarks.

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home–no in-person visits are required.

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

so about a year ago, i started eating less and less and less .. to the point where i ate one meal a day MAX and drank a tea and water. i’d bring my tea to school, sip on that and then go home and eat dinner with my parents but that one meal a day shrank to a very small portion. the thing is, i don’t recall consciously stopping eating... i just did. i’d say for the first couple weeks/first month of me forming these habits i was hungry but then one day , the hunger almost disappeared. i had no desire to eat and i barely craved anything. i lost a lot of weight (not sure on the EXACT number) in a short period of time. i never made myself throw up or anything but i did miss meals and never thought i was skinny enough. i was nauseous frequently, not feeling the best, tired, weak, and my seasonal affective disorder began later and was the worst it had been (SAD is unrelated to this eating thing tho as the eating habits started long before and i get seasonal depression every year). my family was concerned for my health and my mom even said i was looking unhealthy and almost “scrawny” (she had no ill intentions by saying this, it wasn’t offensive to me). my friends dad even looked concerned at me after he saw me for the first time in 3-4 months and questioned if i was okay and asked about my health (not in a mean way, again, i wasn’t offended. he just cared.) i even had a friend who asked if i had some type of disordered eating issue? and i didn’t even know what to say because truthfully, i didn’t know. At this time i didn’t want to gain any weight back and i was happier knowing i wasn’t as “chubby.” growing up i was BEYOND insecure about my body, i hated my body so much and felt so fat all the time. with this whole situation, i felt a little happier about my appearance last year because i was finally slim but i’ve since gained this weight back and i’m obsessing over losing it. i keep thinking about how i wish i could go back to my one a day tiny meal and water/tea diet. i will not do that but it just lingers in my mind.

Hi so this might be a whirlwind because i have a lot of emotional distress with this topic. Since I've only been in 3 relationships (including my current) they have all suffered with EDs. 
My first relationship, they got so ill and nearly hospitalised. My second relationship, they would stress their body out so much with energy supplements, exercise and starving themselves i was convinced they were going to die. 
(im still close with both of them and they're doing better now) but this terrified me for another long distance relationship with an ED because i wasn't physically there enough for them. It just didn't work out. 

 I knew my partner had one but i didn't know he relapsed until recently and it just brings back old feelings. I have disordered eating when i get severe anxiety around my partners and EDs because i tend to eat how they eat when i was around them if that makes sense? A constant nausea feeling so i eat very little. Im just really worried and i can't help it but don't want to bring up my past relationships having it and my feelings because its not about me at all. 
I only know the basic do's and don'ts from experience but it still makes me feel quite useless because all i want to show him is love and understanding that its okay and we can work together? but then again we're long distance and due to covid i cant travel to see him atm so I'm stuck knowing about it from his priv and not even first hand conversation, so i dont want to bring it up if he's not ready? maybe a mutual understanding when we're finally together is enough but how do i show that?

1748,EDPostRequests,1614468011,ltzw61,"Hi there,

I was recently diagnosed with Binge Eating disorder after struggling with cycles of extreme weight loss and weight gain, as well as severe body image issues for most of my life. This has led to a cycle of depression and anxiety, and one suicide attempt in my lifetime.

My therapist encouraged me to follow eating disorder resources on social media to replace the negative messages that I was receiving with positive ones.

I am a 22-year-old man, and one thing that I keep running into is that the vast majority of eating disorder resources are targeted towards women. Looking at the statistics, it's pretty easy to see why: Women struggle with these disorders at much higher rates than men, often twice or even three times as much (Source: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/statistics-research-eating-disorders). Even when attempting to provide me with resources, my therapist struggled to find sources that weren't specifically written in the context of women and girls, and my therapist has informed me that I am the only man registered for the 8-week eating disorder support group that my university offers.

I feel the need to give the context that I have given above before addressing my concerns with this particular subreddit directly because it sets up the level of discomfort that I, and likely many other men, feel in trying to seek help for these disorders. There seems to be this stigma that eating disorders aren't something that affect men directly, and that there is something inherently feminine about them. While I try to separate myself from the toxic notions of masculinity and the sexist fear of appearing feminine, this stigma precludes me from using my friends as a support group because of the inherent ridicule and lack of understanding that is present among my male peers. 

On the flip side, I often find it uncomfortable to try and reach out to the eating disorder community at large because of how heavily oriented it appears to be towards young women, and how vastly outnumbered and out of place I feel. I'd like to think that a lot of other young men feel the same way, but I have yet to meet another man that is open about his struggles with eating disorder and so I really don't know. There's an anxiety associated with my upcoming support group because of this.

When going to the ""Answers to important questions"" page, I found the way that it was formatted to be discouraging. The top posts in the thread are ""How to talk to Her"", ""How to talk to a gf..."", and other posts focusing on parents and their teen daughters, or girlfriends and support from their boyfriends. I feel that these posts are incredibly important, and that they should be posted in a place of prominence in the thread -- particularly because of just how many women struggle with these disorders. 

I just feel that the thread could be organized a little more inclusively so-as not to deter people like me. As a man trying to navigate all of the available resources for eating disorder patients for the first time, it feels uncomfortable to be reminded of how uncommon my experience with eating disorder as a man is as my first exposure to a given community. Perhaps more resources could be added that tackle the male perspective specifically, or the thread could be re-organized such that more gender-neutral self-help or advice to concerned loved one posts could be highlighted at the top of the post, while gendered perspectives could be highlighted lower down. 

I'm not sure if I properly described my concerns above, and I hope that the mod team understands my perspective here. I'm a little scared that my feelings on the matter may be unintentionally misogynistic, and I really hope that that is not the case. I also hope that I'm not being too nitpicky, or making too big a deal out of this. I just genuinely feel out of place with all of this, and reddit feels like the easiest place to reach out to a community and ask about it.",Request: Concerns Regarding Eating Disorder Resources,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ltzw61/request_concerns_regarding_eating_disorder/,1614489611,27-02-21 17:20

I was starting to attempt to eat healthier food in healthier amounts over quarantine and I was doing pretty okay for a month or two, but then I went off of Lexapro and suddenly my appetite was gone. Everything looked gross. I used it as an excuse for about a month before I admitted to myself what was happening and decided to try to recover.

Pretty privilege from being thin (in my country, thin is preferred way more than curvy/chubby) is REAL and I have experienced it. It's mostly subconscious but humans just tend to treat pretty people better. They get the benefit of doubt, they get served better in healthcare or even just retail/F&amp;B, they get more opportunities for social and career advancements and people just want to be around them more. I'm not discounting personality and hard work but being pretty sure helps in life. And comparing myself and how others treat me before and after weight loss, I guess I only look pretty when I'm thin. I don't know how to let go of my current appearance and am dreading how much worse I'm going to look if I continue with recovery.

Hi. Let me start this off  by saying i’m a 16 year old girl who’s trying to lose weight for the  summer. I already don’t have the best relationship with food because i’m  autistic and there’s a lot of foods that bother me. For the past year  or so i’ve been a little overweight and insecure about my looks so i  finally decided to take action and try to lose weight. i’ve been dieting  for about a month and it was going well at first. But now I feel like  i’m becoming too obsessive with it. Like I even started worrying about  the calories in the vitamins i take. My mom also makes comments about my  weight whenever she gets the chance and constantly reminds me that I  need to expand my palette and start liking more foods, or i’m gonna get  diabetes. So that isn’t really helping me either. My biggest concern is  that for the past 2-3 days, i’ve lost a lot motivation to eat and  haven’t really had much in the past few days. And today I just can’t  bring myself to eat at all and i don’t like that. So my question is, am I  developing an eating disorder or am I just in some sort of diet  depression?

1759,EDPostRequests,1615426364,m2ep4f,"i want to start with my history, for context and because i’m really not sure how to talk about all of this. 

i’m in my early 20s, and i’ve had trouble with my body and food since i was about 12. it was mostly just a mild obsession about my weight and turning away breakfast and desserts. it got pretty bad in my freshman year- at least, people noticed and friends would make sure i ate out of concern. i gained a lot of weight from meds in my sophomore year, and had a weird back and forth thing where i would eat whatever, feel like crap, try to restrict, end up eating whatever, repeat. 

when i turned 18 and moved out, it got BAD bad, and without me noticing. i was staying with friends and partying a lot, and i was only eating when we all went out for food. a friend from out of state messaged me one day and asked if i was okay, and said that i was looking sick in the pictures i posted. once i realized that they were right and that i had lost a significant amount of weight, i dove in completely. i’d always felt like i needed to look sick.. some weird delusion that eating disorders were an accomplishment and that i needed to look unhealthy in order for whatever i was doing to be valid. when i realized that it was happening, i used that. i lost a significant amount of weight (idk if i can say this here, but i weighed less than i had my freshman year by this point, and i was pretty underweight.) i started having physical complications, but the doctors in my town didn’t seem to care when i told them that it was because i was restricting. 

i fell into a horrible cycle where i would go for as long as possible without any food, and then around 11pm i would freak out and walk a mile to 7-11 to buy about $10 worth of junk. i’d walk home and eat almost all of it. i called this a binge because it was all junk food and i was eating it all in one sitting, but the same friend who messaged me pointed out that the amount of calories i was consuming wasn’t even enough to constitute a meal. that was my pattern. i became almost obsessive about food; walking back and fourth from the pantry to my bedroom and checking the same nutrition label over and over again unable to decide if i should eat or not. 

i had a sort of spiritual experience in 2019 that made me want to take care of my body and actually live, and over the next year i would get sober, begin cooking small meals for myself, and start celebrating my body fat and muscle returning. i was given an unofficial anorexia diagnosis towards the end, but i never got treatment. honestly, i’m still not entirely sure that thats what it is. i feel like i need someone to flat out tell me that it is for it to be true. 

i did a lot of work on my mental and emotional health, and i became pretty self aware. i knew when i was having a mental health issue and i worked through it, whatever. i was doing well. one thing that i figured out was that my eating disorder was part of a larger cycle of addiction and escape. it started with self harm, and when i started doing drugs i stopped self harming as much. when i stopped doing drugs, i started restricting more, and becoming obsessive about food. it seemed like all of it had been a way to cope with an unresolved pain that i still can’t really identify. 

towards the end of 2020, i noticed that.. that feeling. i can’t name it, but it’s a weird pit in the solar plexus area. its like a craving that’s impossible to satisfy, an emptiness that pushes outwards. its heavy. i recognized it as the feeling i got when my eating disorder was bad, and the feeling i got when i was using drugs. i thought, “okay, heres this feeling! i’m aware of it, and thats a good thing. i can continue taking care of myself and just keep an eye on this.” and i did for awhile, i would give myself pep talks and cook dinner, and whenever i had the chance i made breakfast before work. 

it was around the start of autumn that it got away from me. my excuse was that i didn’t wake up until it was time to get ready for work, that i couldn’t eat a full meal at work and didn’t have time to prep one to bring with, and that i was too tired when i got off. i was concerned when i realized that i was going days with only some snacks, maybe a bagel or a frozen dinner. i still tried, and i ate when i could. i wasn’t restricting and my potions were decent when i ate, but i just.. couldn’t eat. there were random weeks here and there where i suddenly got nauseous as soon as i tried to eat. my weight had gradually increased to around where i was aiming over the course of 2020, so even though i was struggling, i thought that i must be okay. 

which brings me to where i am now. i had to move out of my house at the beginning of the year, so i’m staying with my mom for a bit. i don’t keep track, but if i had to guess, i’m not eating most days. i’m not cooking for myself, and i cant remember the last time i had more than one meal in a day. i have a pattern of not eating all day, and then once everyone’s asleep i’ll raid the pantry/freezer/fridge, bring a bunch of random snacks or leftovers to my room, and eat in bed. it usually takes me a few days to clear the dishes out of my room, and last week i found an empty tub for a family pack of a dessert that i’d eaten over the course of about three hours a few weeks prior. i’d hidden it in my room because i didn’t want anyone to see it in the trash and realize that i’d eaten it all. i turn down food at random times without really consciously thinking about why, and if my family is eating something that i don’t like or cant eat (i’m a vegetarian), i’ll just skip dinner. i’ve lost a few pounds in this last week and it’s really bothering me, so i’ve had to limit my time on the scale. (thats another thing, i weigh myself two or three times a day, but it’s to make sure that i’m maintaining or gaining. it’s just occurred to me that this might not be good for me even if my intention is to gain.) 

tonight my mom cooked and i sat down with my siblings to have dinner and watch a movie. i got my serving (a good size), but i noticed something strange. i got really irritated when my siblings asked for seconds. i hadn’t finished my plate yet, and when i did i was full. but i had this nagging feeling that i needed more, and in a way it felt like i was being threatened or something. nobody noticed or knew why i was asking, but i made a sort of petty comment to my mom about how i hope theres more pasta so i can cook myself some if my siblings eat everything. again, it was very much an internal thing and nobody noticed, but it was mean. i was irritated and anxious that they were eating seconds because that meant that i couldn’t have more (it literally didn’t, theres always more to eat somewhere.) i don’t even know if this makes sense, but it was very concerning that i got so upset over other people eating what i had just *decided* was mine. 

i’m not sure if i’ve explained this well enough, or if maybe i overexplained, but i’m getting worried. i never got treatment the first time around, i just decided to get better and did my best. i’m able to recognize false beliefs, and “i just cant eat” or “it’s just too hard” are definitely that. i’m scared. i don’t know whats happening or why, but i feel like it’s not good. i’m not intentionally doing this, so why am i doing the things i did when it was intentional? why did it just.. happen? my theories are that since it started up again around the time of year that i randomly dissociate/get depressed, that maybe it’s a response to the trauma that caused this addictive cycle in the first place? then theres the way depression sometimes causes a decrease in appetite, so maybe when that happened the old habits just sort of took over? i don’t know, and maybe i’m overthinking it. but this feels like it could get bad.",Request: am i right to be worried? what should i do?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/m2ep4f/request_am_i_right_to_be_worried_what_should_i_do/,1615447964,10-03-21 19:32

Hi all,, I(f20) have recently become aware of the fact that ive been unintentionally underfeeding myself. As in, I'll go throughout my day, and towards the end I feel floaty and disassociated.

Hello,

I've been really lost recently and I hope to find some answers here. I know I always had quite a bad relationship with food and weight, since childhood. When I was a child, and was in retrospective an healthy weight, I was always ashamed of my weight, and obsessing with it. I wanted to go on the scale several times a day, which my parents then forbade me to do, and liked to have the flu because it meant I was going to lose some weight. I was deeply convinced I was fat, even though 1) there was nothing wrong if I was, 2) but in any case, I wasn't. I don't think I had any problem eating, we've always been quite big eaters in my family, and I don't recall comments that I could have interpreted as shameful from my family.

Middle school flew by, being quite the same. In high school, I decided to lose some weight. I decided to count calories, which was definitely a bad idea. I used an app, which gave me a daily calories intake probably too low, and I was aiming to be always under it. I found some images on the internet, which gave me some """"calories goals"""" that I wanted to follow. I was of course feeling guilty when eating, but didn't restrict myself too much I think: I still ate, usually quite fatty meals, but always following my intake. I tried to make myself vomit twice, but didn't succeed (which is clearly for the best). I lost weight and I was happy with it, though I wanted to lose more. I got myself out of this after a few months, and slowly gained back some weight the following years. I sometimes thought I did that to be interesting, with the glamorisation of ED, and because I hoped someone would see I felt bad. I don't know now.

Back to now. For the past year, I've had a growing difficulty with my body image and food. I've always skipped some meals, and felt happy when I did, but I was doing it more frequently. With Covid and everything, I've gained some weight again. I'm slightly overweight I'd say. The past few months have been more difficult. I've skipped meals for three days in January, eating some compote here and there. I did it because I felt really low in general, not only because I felt bad about myself, and it gave some satisfaction doing so. I tried vomit, and I'm now grateful I didn't. I've been crying thinking about my body, or seeing it, or comparing myself to others. I've cried a few times because I felt guilty I ate a little bit too much when I wanted to lose weight. I like to eat, I really like it, perhaps too much as I have tendency to eat my emotions, and restricting myself feels like punishment that I somehow deserve because I don't have the body I want. I'm scared really trying a diet, because I'm scared I will become obsessed with calorie intake again. I'm still feeling like I just want to be interesting.

It sounds more to me like I have deep body image issues, and an unhealthy relationship with food, without actual ED, but I'd like to have some input. I'm sorry for the long text, and hope it wasn't all over the place. I hope the best for each one of you.

1771,EDPostRequests,1615257676,m0wu27,"I want to recover so, so badly. More than anything. The mental load that my ED takes up is unbearable. But I face this huge, glaring problem that, even when I eat intuitively, I end up consuming an objectively large number of calories (without posting numbers, it’s around double my TDEE). This isn’t extreme hunger either (as far as I'm aware) -- I’ve experienced that, and it feels quite different. My hunger and satiety cues work fine, I just genuinely require this many calories to feel satiated. I don’t eat junk-food, I don’t cook with oil, I only drink water and coffee, etc. The surplus comes purely from the amount of food I eat, not the type. 

When I recovered for ~1 year, I gained more weight than ever before and weighed much more than I’d ever weighed before my ED started. This is despite never drinking my calories, only going out to eat when my partner or friends requested it, trying not to snack, eating predominately fruit/veg and lean protein, and working an active job. 
When I saw that number on the scale a year ago, I relapsed. Now, I’m stuck in limbo. I don’t have a ‘middle ground’: I can either restrict and be hungry, or I can eat to satiety and gain weight. Eating AT maintenance feels just like restricting (I’m still hungry at the end of the day), so I might as well just be restricting if it makes no difference.

I guess what I’m asking is: is this my fate now? Am I destined to require this many calories to feel satiated? Will I never be able to intuitively maintain a healthy weight? Am I doomed to be hungry for the rest of my life for the price of not eating myself to death? Everywhere I’ve looked, the only answer I see is “you have to make peace with weight gain, and your weight will stabilize over time”, but I don’t want to make peace with the weight gain. I’m terrified to know where my weight will stabilize at, and I’m sure it won’t be healthy. Is there anything at all that I can do to counteract this? I’ve been wondering lately if maybe the weight I start recovering at would play a part in the weight I eventually stabilize at? If I start at underweight, will I end up at a normal weight? Or will I always have to meticulously control my intake to avoid significant weight gain?

I feel like I shouldn’t even be here but ig I am. I just feel a bit stupid writing this but this has been bothering me a lot lately. So about 2 weeks ago I started ig to relapse? I don’t know tbh. I stopped eating for a whole week and once I took my first bite I cried but managed to eat. After I just felt full and nauseous but I ended up purging and not cuz I felt guilty but cuz I just didn’t wanna go back to the weight i used to be. I promised myself it was fine I was just not going to eat anymore. The next day I cried because I just wanted to eat but couldn’t get myself to take a bite. I cried watching my family eat but got over it and didn’t eat. This is where I felt maybe I actually do have a problem. Maybe I’m actually relapsing. However after that day  I started again feeling like I was faking everything.    I felt like if I ate i could but I just couldn’t get myself to eat without hesitating. I could already see the numbers on the scale increasing. I didn’t think it was worth eating after I finally got out of that number i was stuck on. I’ve stopped eating greasy food since my mom drowns the food with oil I always feel it on my hands and don’t eat it. I just don’t find it worth eating? If that makes sense? If I’m going to eat it has to be something I’ve been craving or something I already have a home if I don’t I won’t even buy it. Whenever I eat something though I have no problem eating but it just doesn’t feel right..? It feels like I’m doing something wrong and like i said I see the image of my scale and the numbers increase but it doesn’t make mr cry its more of just like “damn...I’ll try to lose it tomorrow “. Whenever I eat since it doesn’t feel right I purge it and like I said it’s not because I feel guilty which is why I feel like I’m faking everything. I do count calories but when I don’t its like “oh well its not much anyways and its the only thing I’ve ate” . I just try to keep it under 1000. Although it feels wrong..it feels as if I’m faking it because I’m not crying like before. It feels wrong because I don’t feel guilty. However I spend my whole day triggering myself its weird. Yesterday though my mom made a comment when i was going to allow myself to eat some ramen she said “I thought you were supposed to be eating healthy “ and once she said that I instantly started crying and didn’t eat it. I got into an argument with her and at night i got some cookies and candy but tbh i didn’t even enjoy it because I just didn’t enjoy food the way i used to before anorexia. I got upset at myself because i felt like there was no reason for me to eat that. Anyways my point is I feel like I’m faking it but at the same time I’m confused it’s messing with my mind . I don’t know if its just me missing my disease and feel unstable when i think I’m okay but yea...

Hello, I am wondering if I have an eating disorder. Let me first start off by saying I was identified male at birth. I am 15 years old and I have a hard time eating. I feel hungry but I never want to eat. When I eat I feel this overwhelming guilt like I did something wrong. Some days this feeling of not wanting to eat is worse others its less bad and I eat semi-healthily however the amount of time it feels less bad is shortening. I end up wanting to self harm after eating and I really want to know if I have an eating disorder.

Yesterday I spoke to a doctor through telehealth video. It’s like a step you can take to determine if you need to see a doctor in person. I contacted him because everyday for the past 3 weeks I have felt nauseous throughout the day. (I’m 1000% positive I’m not pregnant). He asked for a bit of background so o told him so basic stuff like sometimes I get headaches, I only eat once a day because eating outside of dinner literally makes me want to vomit. Like, if I try to physically put food in my mouth before dinner time I get nauseous and can’t finish it. No clue why, I just developed it. I told him other things like I was diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety and Depression. I told him I smoke a lot too. So as he’s giving me some suggestions on what it could be he mentioned “well this could also be happening from your eating disorder.” And I was so confused because I’ve never had anyone say that to me. I never thought eating once a day was an eating disorder.

Having had my own experiences of an eating disorder, alongside supporting friends and a family member I've found that approaches to treating eating disorders can be quite narrowly focused, often CBT for eating disorders is used in NHS settings and often treats presenting symptoms rather than underlying causes.
 
I've designed a two-week compassion focused intervention for young people aged 16-21 with eating difficulties which is online and using virtual reality technology. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that a compassionate approach may be valuable for people with eating disorders, due to high trait perfectionism, self-criticism and experiences of shame.
 
I was hoping you may be able to share my research (if that's appropriate) on the sub reddit. I feel like it’s something people would want to possibly take part in, as I know the eating disorder community is very proactive and focused on increased support, recognition and funding.

My post is this

So a few days ago my girlfriend threw up infront of me and told me I willed her to do it when she was really upset. She later apologized and told me it has nothing to do with me. She told me she's had problems with eating disorders before and that she's relapsing. 

I try to tell her she's beautiful the way she is but she's shown me this stuff on tumblr ""thinspo"" and it really scared me because it's some kind of group that focuses on anorexia and idolizes it. She told me she wants to be a ""monotone twig"" and look sickly. I tried taking her to the hospital but I couldn't wait with her, she also suffers Bipolar disorder and is medicated for it which really helps her. However she had me pick her up and hour and a half later and told me they refused to admit her even though she hasn't eaten in 4 days and says she has no plans on eating. She said her goal is a 7 day fast and it really worries me, she does not seem like herself because she has no energy, she's pale and sickly and I just don't know what I can do to help.

The last 3 night I had work I had a 4 hour sleep because it ends up turning into an argument when I just want her to get better or atleast eat. It's hurting me so hard too see her this way and I just don't know what to do. 

I wish I could just relax and not worry about it, go play a video game and have everything be calm. But I'm consumed by this guilt that she's sick and I'm not doing anything, I feel horrible whenever I try to do anything.

1785,EDPostRequests,1615763535,m56wqk,"The story I tell myself is that if I don’t worry about my weight - I will become a fat slob and no one will love me. What about being fat makes me slob? Why are those two words linked together? I didn’t worry about my eating to the point I was never hungry and I was over restricting. That sent my body into famine mode and every calorie I eat is gobbled up by my body and held onto for dear life because my body doesn’t trust that it will get food again.

 I understand this principle. But, how do I eat? I am not hungry!! I do not crave any food right now. I am 17 days post op from a partial hysterectomy and a reconstruction of the structure of my pelvic organs. This surgery (3 procedures) has done a number on my body. And my poor butthole has forgotten how to poop normally because it has been since last May since that happened. I am on a every other day cycle - good day - challenging day. I hit three good days in a row and yesterday and today are so CHALLENGING. 

So - I used to tell myself that I needed alcohol to cope with the stress of my life and I changed that story. Why is this harder? This is not the first time you have read my words around food. I just read the Fuck It Diet. I have to eat consistently to get my body to recover from the famine it has been in since August when I got sober. I figured I would get the food thing figured out once I got my feet under me around the alcohol. Well, I am 7 months sober and this food thing is real. I am alone for the first time since surgery - and I don’t want to eat. I know I need to eat, but I don’t want to eat. I need to figure this out. I started to touch on it when I went to my first ED appointment but it hurt too much to stay there. It doesn’t help that I know if I eat, I am going to have to poop. And that is not a guarantee right now. 

So it is a lie that I will become fat if I don’t worry about my weight. But even if I did become fat, would that be so bad? Is fat really unhealthy? Must it be avoided at all costs? Was I really happy when I was skinny? The last time I was skinny - I was drinking my face off because I couldn’t moderate. Is that really that healthy? I have lost and gained the same 30 pounds for the past 30 years. I loved the accolades and acknowledgement I got when I lost the weight. Not gonna lie. I do not like how I feel when I am big. But that has more to do with how I see myself than with being big. Why does skinny me have more value? I don’t have answers to any of this. But, I am asking the hard questions.

1787,EDPostRequests,1615716356,m4sijc,"Literally my first known memory was a negative food-related experience when I was about 2 or younger. My parents had a sad look on their face and kept apologizing as I cried while they tried to put the feeding tube down my nose. Until I was about 4, I had seen multiple pediatric nutritionists, and none were able to get me to eat (hence why I was on the feeding tube), but my parents said I randomly started eating after that point.
During childhood, I never really had a great relationship with food in general. I was always extremely thin (I was usually within the ~ 10-20 percentile) since childhood and eating was never really enjoyable to me. I'm not exactly sure what it was, but I just never had the desire to eat regardless of how long I went without eating or how much physical activity I did. I did not have any favorite foods and I did not care to eat what the other kids did. I used to fast and stick to a vegetarian diet at 10 years old. I got called skinny and twig a lot on the playground, but it didn't bother me since I did not understand. I was a runner and swimmer all my life as well, with both sports athletes often skinny.

Up to that point, I wouldn't say it could've been considered a disorder, but rather I believe my childhood has set me up all the way to now.

All throughout middle school, I was severely bullied by my peers, people I considered ""friends,"" and even my teachers would occasionally join in on making fun of me. One of the things I was bullied for was being skinny, and it didn't help that I was a quiet and shy person at the time. My self esteem dropped dramatically and I believe it was at this time I developed an anxiety disorder. It also really worsened my depression, which I can see dates back to at least 5th grade.

From then, food and eating slowly became negatively connotated in my mind. Whenever I felt upset or anxious, food was absolutely the last thing on my mind. I found out my junior year of high school that I have incredibly high levels of somatization, which leads to me constantly feeling sick or just physically unwell whenever I'm in a bad mood. It wasn't uncommon for me to go an entire day without eating a single bite of food.

All of this was severely intensified by the abuse I received from my second girlfriend I dated junior to senior year of high school, who caused me to develop PTSD. I lost a lot of weight over that period of time.

Today is near the 1.5 year mark of the end of that relationship, but now unfortunately I got stuck in another one. My inability to leave has always been my downfall and it's just pushing my eating even worse. Its gotten to the point where I've lost more weight than the other relationship caused, and I will almost never eat on my own, though if I eat it must be in private or with friends. I do not like eating with my family, as they constantly comment on my weight and make me feel like shit about it.

Hello, lately I have been feeling super self conscious all the time, and have been doing things that somebody with an Ed would do, and it’s sort of concerning for me. But also it makes me happier when I do these things, even though I know that they are dangerous and should be bad.

So basically I have been trying every single day to restrict with what I eat. I used to eat what I wanted and was happy, but I was always a little self conscious. But lately things have been getting much worse for me. I usually skip breakfast whenever possible, or try to wake up super late so that I can skip breakfast all together on weekends. It makes me really happy and feel good (mentally feel good, but it physically makes me feel like I’m going to pass out and that I’m dizzy). I might have some fruit, a smoothie, or vegetables for lunch. But if I don’t have lunch or breakfast, I would usually end up making something in the afternoon because I can’t take it :/ which makes me feel guilty and that I “wasted” a day of not eating because I ate something. I usually eat dinner if I have to, but I still feel guilty. I feel like I eat a lot, but I’m really not eating enough at all. Some family and friends are starting to notice and they are somewhat concerned sometimes and one of my friends reminds me to eat. It doesn’t make me eat usually, (bc usually I was already planning on eating something healthy for when that time that they texted me at) it’s really nice to know that they care about me.

I have also recently started to exercise more, in hopes that it would help to burn off some already low numbered calories, and make me lose weight easier and faster. I still began to not eat as much, along with the exercise. It’s not over exercising usually, just maybe an hour walk/somewhat a speed walk on a little bike trail behind our house. 

I feel like I’m not bad enough to get help for it, or bother my friends on what I think about it in fear of being invalidated just because I’m not underweight, I’m average. I get so happy when I only eat one meal a day, or just eat small healthy snacks throughout the day. Fruit and vegetables have been my fav recently. But I have also been looking at a lot of triggering vids online, which only want to make me restrict what I eat, and exercise more. I avoid eating foods that I used to love. I hate it. I can’t be happy, and I feel fat all the time except for days where I don’t eat anything yet, and it’s the afternoon time and I’m starving usually.

I (22F) struggled with anorexia as a teen, around age 13-15. My parents didn’t believe me, so I healed from it on my own when I saw my health declining so rapidly. It took me at least a year to start eating normally again, and many more to get the obsessive thoughts under control. However, the way I solved it was by moving into a sort of orthorexic eating style.

First I was vegan, for 7 years. I thought I healed from my ED, but really I just cut out all the food groups I thought were unhealthy.

Over time I moved into a quality-obsession, fueled by my yoga teacher training. Gluten free, sugar free, dairy free, meat free, no preservatives, no “chemicals”, etc etc. Thankfully, I moved away from that too.

Now I’m starting to try and get my health on track, but I find myself easily falling back into ED behavior. I’m trying to make healthy eating choices, but I quickly get obsessive, extremely guilty when I don’t eat “perfectly”, cry over my body and what I’ve eaten, and don’t eat even when I’m hungry.

I don’t know what to do. I need to eat healthier, but it just goes from one extreme to the other (eating all processed/fried foods to eating obsessively healthy without leniency). If I don’t care at all about my diet, I don’t have ED behaviors. But this also means I eat really poorly. If I do care about my diet, I immediately obsess.

I’ve been crying a lot recently about not being perfect with my diet. Today I sobbed just thinking about that we were having pizza for dinner. I ate it anyway, but I don’t like how close that is to my illness.

I don’t want to be back in that place again. I don’t know what to do. My boyfriend is doing a social media break with me, because he thinks that will help my body image. But I’m afraid and I don’t know what to do.

I have always been underweight, but have had relatively big cheeks, which is an insecurity of mine, so my face fat is the major cause for my eating disorder.

I developed my unhealthy eating habits, when I was around 12-13, because I stopped working out. Then I got very tired of restrict-binge cycle and around 16 got into exercising again, forgetting all of the food-related issues. I worked out regularly for a year-and-a-half and had great results, my confidence also rose, but then I moved to a boarding school, where I have a roommate and cannot work out due to being shy and socially awkward. Now I am 18 and I have been eating healthy for about 5 months, but last month I started to restrict again, because I noticed my face losing its shape, even if I was still underweight.

I am overloaded with schoolwork and feel very stressed. Relapsing is the least thing, that I want at the moment. I was planning on going back to eating healthier and starting working out in summer, when I go back home, but I know, that when I come back to school, I will not be able to continue working out.

What do you suggest I do? I would really appreciate your help.

I say that because I stopped eating etc and was severely thin but it wasn’t due to me tracking calories etc, but raather due to stress, depression, and anxiety. Maybe me saying I wasn’t “traditionally” anorexic is wrong, but I haven’t been to therapy or gotten involved in eating disordered communities until right now, so bear with me. Anyways, I had a very bad relationship with food. That was years ago, (I’m now 23), but in the last year I quit cocaine and adderall, drugs which obviously affected my weight and food habits. It’s been at least 6 months since I’ve done either and I now work out 5 days a week and watch what I eat. I feel the healthiest I have in my body in so long, yet I recently went home to my moms house and weighed myself (I don’t own my own scale) and cried when I saw my weight. My mom also has body issues and told me she noticed I’d gained weight. It really hurt to see myself as bigger than I thought I was...and I hate that feeling and thought so much. It shouldn’t feel so bad to be a little bigger than I used to be, yet it somehow is so upsetting to me. I feel terrible for that having that feeling. I am trying so hard to love myself, but it’s discouraging when I’m working out and really trying to be healthy, yet gaining weight. I want so badly to love my soft curves and feminine body but I’m struggling to find myself beautiful right now. I guess I’m just asking for words of encouragement and advice on finding yourself and your body beautiful again. I realized I never thought my body was beautiful, even when I was 100 pounds I still saw my tummy looking soft and fat even when it wasn’t. It’s a hard realization to have, that I have never seen my body as beautiful...anyways. I guess I’m still recovering and looking for advice.

in the last couple of years i’ve been using restrictive eating as a way to self harm when my mental health gets bad but i didn’t really correlate it to body image issues. i just started to develop an unhealthy relationship as food where in times of stress i would see it as something i had to earn 

and in the past year due to a situation in my personal life my body image and self esteem took a very deep dive. worst it’s ever been and honestly i’m scared how much it’s messed up my mental health. since my mental health has been worse, so have my eating habits because of this pattern of restrictive eating (skipping meals, not feeling like i deserve food, being painfully hungry but not eating because i wanted to self harm, punishing myself because i hate how i look) 

i never correlated it to an ED because i’m insecure about how i’m underweight, so it made no sense that i would eat less. but recently it’s gotten really bad, my weight is lower than it was when i was 13 (i’m 18 now and a few inches taller), i’ve been having really bad blood sugar drops the past few months. i talked to my doctor and he asked me if i was anorexic but i assured that i wasn’t because at the time it didn’t seem like “typical” anorexia, but now i’m not too sure.

I knew it was there and I ignored it. I would hate being weighed and would ask gym teachers and drs not to tell me the amount. I am now 21 and after my last break up in September I have lost a significant amount of weight but I don’t see it. 

Lately My entire family has been pointing it out. I recently saw my dad and younger brother for the first time in 6 months last month and the first thing they commented on was the fact that I look like a “stick” even though I made sure to wear a sweater and loose pants. My mom has also been concerned, my stepdad said I look sick and pale and not healthy. My aunt pulled me aside and asked if I was having problems or if I was stressed out because I looked sick. Now all they do is ask if I have eaten. My dad has called me basically crying to make sure I am eating. I went to gynecologist two days ago and he asked if I had problems with food because I was underweight and he noticed I had lanugo which is fine hair people who are malnourished get. I tried giving blood a few weeks ago and they denied me because of low iron which has never happened. I also found out that my armpit hair which had been turning light brown/orange for a few months (I thought it was my natural deodorant) is a sign of malnutrition. But I just don’t see it. 

I look at pictures from last summer and I look bigger, way bigger, but I remember feeling like I look the same as I do now. I don’t see a difference. I finally bought a scale in January of 2021 weigh myself every day multiple times a day. It is all I think about. Food is all I think about. All day. I started concerta a few months ago and Ritalin before that and that has contributed to suppressing my appetite and it makes me feel good. I record myself, I guess “body checking”, multiple times a day and take pictures when I notice My stomach looks different. I have an entire album dedicated to body changes over the last year. 

My psychiatrist wants me to join an ed recovery program and iop but I just don’t think I am sick enough. My BMI is barely underweight for my height (5’7) and I don’t look underweight. And if I am wrong I don’t know how to tell my family. They already know I struggle with bipolar and depression anxiety all this stuff and it is too much. I don’t have time to go to iop and ed program while going to school and working full time to afford to survive. Another problem I have is invalidating my mental illness I continue to ghost therapists because I feel like my problems aren’t important enough or good enough and that I am wasting their time. I feel that if I join iop and ed program it would be the same and that I just wouldn’t be sick enough to be there. Sometimes I feel like I have to get worse on purpose to be taken seriously.

When I was in the first lockdown, I gained some weight as did everybody so I tried to stop my snacking by drinking tons of water and coffee. I get bloated very easily after eating but I started to feel incredibly insecure at this time as I realised that even LIQUIDS made me bloated too!!! I think another contributing factor is the fact that in lockdown I obv spend more time on social media where I would see all these skinny body types and that really just made me hate my body even more (but I dont want it to seem that it was those girls' fault bc it definitely not! I just want to point that out). So yh I cut down on my food intake but not too much. Then in October everything got worse. I was really stressed due to all the school work I had so that might have impacted my food habits (but im not sure) and I started doing lots of exercises each day and limiting my food intake. Then by December, I cut out breakfast completely and would have my first meal at 1-2 pm. But this would just make me hungry after so I would snack a lot so then the day after I would not eat a lot to balance it out. TW (just incase) I started this lil habit where after lunch or dinner (whenever I could), I would stuff my mouth with the food on my plate, w/o chewing, run up to the bathroom and spit it out in the toilet ( keep in mind that my portions are already quite small). So I kept on doing this most days. At this time, mum started noticing that I had lost weight in my legs and started telling me she's worried about me and that I need to eat more (she still says this) and it would just make me feel really upset.

Meal plans feel like I restrict myself and Dont allow for true food freedom, because i can't cant to restaurants or eat certain things because they don't ""fit"" into my plan or i dont know the exchanges for them. Also let's say i crave chips and a cookie as a snack but i only have 1 starch and a dairy, i end up having a piece of bread and milk instead. Also, sometimes i get hungry between meals and snacks or just want more and the meal plan limits me to a certain amount at a certain time so i have to ignore my hunger.

Or what if i never really recover and am stuck in Quasi forever with or without knowing it. Or get stuck in the relapse cycle like i have for the past 4 years. Plus I'm worried bc i started at 15 and that may have stunned my growth and idk if i can repair that, i had irregular periods before Ana and don't remember if they ever became regular while i was in my best phase of recovery. Also not sure what my body should weight or look like because of this. I'm so jealous of other people who have recovered and have perfect bodies, like how? And 15 yr olds nowadays look like supermodels and i was an ugly blob. I'm also worried about picking the wrong treatment team or way to recover. Like what if i do X method of recovery and thats the reason I become overweight or hate myself or my body/mind doesn't recover fully When the Y method would have given me happiness. Everything is so complicated and hard, sometimes i feel like i feel like i can't ever recover, it isn't possible.

My mom said I had to gain some weight bc she was worried, so I gained weight slowly while doing intense weightlifting in our basement for over 6 months, getting up to x last december, more within normal range.

&amp;#x200B;

I was feeling kind of crappy and noticed some symptoms of low testosterone so I went to get them tested. It came back super low (x ng/dl), and I was crushed because it meant I couldn’t gain muscle like a normal guy, and all I had worked for went to zero. My mom decided to take complete control without talking to doctors first, saying it was caused by my calorie deficit in the summer (I was eating probably around x at my lowest and limiting healthy fats). She and my dad forced me to gain z lbs in 3 weeks and I felt suicidal over that I had lost control and looked skinny-fat (high body fat percentage, but lower weight with little muscle). After this I lost a bit of weight down to (higher than before they forced me) where I am maintaining. Somehow, my testosterone when I get tested at (highest) lbs was lower (x ng/dl) than it was most recently at z lbs (y ng/dl), but remains super low.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason testosterone is important to me is I want to gain muscle mass with less fat like other guys can. If I don’t have normal testosterone I feel like I can’t gain weight. I eat a very healthy and balanced diet with enough healthy fats carbs and protein (ground beef, avocados, EVOO, eggs, chicken, veggies-enough calories to maintain weight), but pretty much the same thing every day (except occasionally going out to eat with friends), maintaining my weight for a few months now.

&amp;#x200B;

All of my health markers are healthy except low testosterone, and I looked into artificial replacement so I can gain weight and not feel bad about it. My parents refuse to consider this and say testosterone replacement will cause cancer, and it can be fixed if I gain more weight. I read some studies however, and testosterone only returns back to AN patients to tiny tiny levels compared to a healthy 19 yr old male, and I don’t want to become skinny-fat for the sake of mediocre levels where I don’t feel any better.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m x lbs, which is well within normal BMI, but they want me to add more weight which I can’t take. They took me to a specialist who said I have AN, and my parents said they won’t let me go to college this coming fall (studying remote rn) if I don’t get better by then. I feel suicidal because I can’t be convince to gain without normal T levels, and my program doesn’t allow a gap year- if I can’t go I have to drop out. Have any guys had experience with T recovery or AN symptoms even in normal BMI?

Hi everyone! I was wondering if someone could explain the difference between eating disorders and disordered eating for me? I tried to look it up online and just got confused. I do not know if I fall into either of the two, but I do wish I knew if the way I feel has a name to it you know?

Basically, I've always been self-conscious about my body but it got a bit out of hand my freshman year of college. I got really stressed second semester and I turned to food as I always did in high school, stuffing my face until I gained xx pounds in the next ten weeks. Considering that I'm 5'1"", that was quite a bit of weight for my particular frame. I felt like I had lost control.

I lost the weight that summer by exercising three times a day and I knew it wasn't the best way to go about it, but the results reinforced me to continue. When I came back to college my sophomore year, I was so terrified of gaining the weight back that I started taking three different supplements off of Amazon to suppress my appetite, burn more fat, etc. I kept a journal that talked about my meals each day and graded myself based on how I thought I did. I counted calories obsessively, went to the gym, and punished myself with more workouts when I thought I ate too much. I tried to make myself throw up quite a few times and it never worked, which I am thankful for.

I realized I had a problem when I got so woozy from the pills one day that I passed out and fell down the stairs. I stopped taking the pills and started losing weight in a healthier way by thinking of it more like a lifestyle change than a weight loss thing.

Today, I think I'm in a better place with food, but certainly not a good one. I still punish myself when I eat too much or just sit there hating myself and I feel like I'm being ridiculous but I cannot help the way my mind works. I don't know if this is normal and there are other people who think like this. I just feel kind of lost with it all.

She is clearly projecting her insecurities on me. I know she doesn't do it to be mean- it's her disease talking.

i have a lot of sensitivity to foods for some reason - many foods make me nauseous and i cannot even fathom the thought of consuming certain textures. the smallest thing like a smell or color in food can put me off or even thinking of eating that food can make me have a visceral shudder reaction. this isn’t every day but some days or weeks i am more put off by food and also sometimes experience nausea related to my anxiety (possibly) and this makes me unable to eat until it goes away. 
i have looked into the possibility of ARFID? if anyone has that  and this sounds like something you have experienced please let me know i can’t really tell if i fit the symptoms.

i also have been struggling with my body image more lately. i sometimes fixate on my body and look in the mirror for a long time. i sometimes find myself body checking. i have never restricted my eating, tried to eat less or eat healthier or chosen my food based on what would allow me to lose weight. i am not interested in losing weight per se because i am already a bit underweight and know losing more weight would be unhealthy probably.

1835,EDPostRequests,1617789340,mlynuh,"I’ve only been on a restrictive diet for about a year. But recently it’s resulted in me being obsessive and stressed about eating. I’ve developed this binge/restrict habit and it’s been making me feel miserable. Usually, during the week I feel bad because i’m hungry but won’t allow myself to eat. During the weekends, I eat so much that I feel sick and feel horrible for not being able to control my urges. 

I guess the past week has been my longest binge. i’ve been eating whatever I want whenever I want and it’s resulted in me eating significantly more than my maintenance calories. This makes me feel extremely full and guilty after. After searching this sub i’ve come to realize that I might be experiencing extreme hunger. I’m just scared that i’m never going to stop eating. Like others, i’m terrified of gaining weight. Today, after eating I calculated how much i’d weigh if I kept eating this way and I practically burst into tears. I know this may be part of the healing process but how do you get through it? I want to make up for this past week by going back into a deficit and burning off more calories and it’s taking everything in me not to. How do I get over the guilt?

I also feel so alone/alienated at this time. I live with three other people and I can’t help but feel that i’m eating a monstrous amount compared to them or that they’re secretly judging me for how much i’ve been eating.

Hey all, I've been in recovery for a while and hitting a bit of a difficult time in my life, which prompts food/body issues for me. I've been thinking a lot about food as a numbing agent and I've more or less successfully avoided using it as such.

However, when I stop and look around, it seems like many things are numbing agent. Binge watching a TV show is a pretty good way to avoid difficult feelings, for me. Reading book after book is a more ""society approved"" way to disappear in another world. Having a cocktail to ""take the edge off"" seems in a similar realm. 

So where does it end? I cannot be in therapy or reading self help books or introscpect every freaking minute. I'm allowed to watch a good show or read a book or have a beer if I want to. But when does it become a problem? When is it numbing?

I say this based on her previous history of ED, and combined with current ongoing behaviors. For a little more background, she has PCOS, and has struggled with weight and hormonal regulation most of her adult life. She actually felt the best when she was taking daily shots prior to IVF to conceive our now 1 year-old daughter. She would say, ""Finally - my body is doing what it's supposed to for the first time!"" She actually looked and felt her best for the first few postpartum months.

More recently, she has lied to me about making extra stops on the way home from work for junk food, hiding snack foods in various places around the house, eating in secret and hiding the evidence. (I had been thinking of making PB/CC cookies, but couldn't find the peanut butter morsels I knew she'd brought home a bag of. Digital receipt said she bought 3 bags, and all of them were hidden far from the pantry.) So I brought up my frustration with being lied to along with her unhealthy eating, but it was also at the tail-end of several other issues I was airing out. We both acknowledged that she has struggled with impulse control and making healthy choices, but she said she would work on it. I asserted that I don't primarily care about what she weighs or what she looks like - I care that she makes healthier, more balanced dietary choices for the sake of herself, for our daughter, and for me. I have tried to be subtle before about stocking more fruits and veggies, practicing portion control, getting more outdoor activity into our routine... but I told her I couldn't bite my tongue anymore. Her health and presence in our lives is too important to tiptoe around.

Cut to last night where I find a container of chocolate fudge, nearly empty can of chips, and other stuff around the house that was clearly not meant to be found by me. My immediate response is anger: I'm angry that I've been lied to repeatedly, angry that she's clearly not curtailing this behavior at all, angry that it's affecting how I see her as a partner, angry that she's decreasing her quality of life for herself, for me, and for our daughter. But I know I can't come to her with that as my delivery.

I genuinely care about her and want to help her make necessary changes, but this is some sort of addiction beyond anything I can talk of out her. Does anyone have any experience with this?

1845,EDPostRequests,1617616183,mkgyy0,"Basically I'm not sure what *flavour* of ED I have but I want to engage in things safely if possible. I have a 1.5 year old son and I need to be healthy for him and not die from heart failure etc.

I was extremely overweight at the start of this year, 5'2. Four months later I'm a healthy average weight. It is a large amount of rapid weightloss. I've set a really strict goal weight which is on the lower end of healthy. I won't go below that at all.

I try to calorie restrict to xxx cals a day (around the bottom of what's recommended for dieting). I take lots of vitamins and vary my foods to make sure I'm not deficient. I try to mainly eat lean meat, fruit and veggies and milk.

I drink a lot of caffeine. 4 cups of instant coffee in the morning, no sugar and half milk, although recently I'm trying to switch to sugar free energy drinks. I also drink sugar free caffeinated soda. I need it so that I can curb my appetite and get things done otherwise I can't move off the couch but I'm worried about my heart. Is this doing a lot of damage?

I might also be getting medicine for my ADHD soon. How does caffeine work with that? Anything I need to watch out for on medication?

I do some little exercise, situps and pushups, ebery few days, but I find it hard to breathe and my chest feels funny for a while after (heart skips beats etc). Should I be avoiding exercise?

Some days I'll go over my calorie limit and eat bad foods, or deliberately shovel down a crap tonne of bad foods as fast as possible and then purge. I worry about my teeth and damage to my throat. How can I prevent damage and keep my teeth as good as possible? Also, sometimes if I've purged a bit, it's like my gag reflex goes away and I have to try really hard to make myself throw up and I worry that does even more damage. How can I fix that?

My binging and uncontrollable hunger all the time really scares me. Even when I wasn't dieting at all I could easily put back yyy calories (a very large number) over a single eating session and still think about food all the time. I watch mukbang constantly and drink 4 litres+ a day to try to curb it. Caffeine is the only thing that stops it temporarily. It causes me huge distress but my therapist and gp insist that being hungry is normal. Are there any safer ways that I can moderate the hunger?

A few months ago I started using tik tok, where I somehow found myself in a pro ana rabbithole. I found the posts extremely disturbing, and got triggered, but yet I was intrigued by them and I watched more. I started comparing myself to the skinny people doing thinspo posts on tik tok, and I think it was somewhere around here that I decided that if I want to be skinnier I´d have to skip meals and eat less. I started off by just skipping breakfast, but eating a pretty moderate amount for lunch and dinner. The last few weeks have been worse. I´ve started skipping both breakfast and lunch, or breakfast and dinner. If I´m at a friends house I´ll tell my parents I´ve had dinner there and I´ll tell my friend I´ll eat dinner at home. One time me and my friends were planning on eating dinner together, we were only making a salad, and I panicked because I had eaten breakfast and some treat at noon. I told my friends I wasn´t hungry. Yesterday my mother had baked bread, and she had put one piece out for me to eat. I didn´t feel like I deserved breakfast so I put the piece of bread in my bag to throw out:(.

I think my parents are a little worried about me, they are always asking what I last ate and trying to make sure I have eaten.

I still eat candy, but if I do I´ll make sure to eat less when it comes to other meals. The thing is, after reading about other peoples experience with eating disorders, everyone seems to avoid candy and it seems to be a big no-no.

Hi everyone, I’m having a very hard time coming to terms with what I may have to do in order to seek help. I’ve been bulemic for 12 years, and recently I’ve started feeling extremely guilty for continuing to do this when I have a loving husband who wants to build a future with me. He wants me to stop more than anything, and I’ve told him so many times that I would and I haven’t, I feel terrible for lying and I know I need to change something. 

I’m terrified about what I’ll find out when I inevitably go to the doctor, I haven’t been in years, and once I go I feel like it will all be real.

I either completely stop eating and survive on a couple of coffees a day, or I eat big portions all throughout the day (even when i'm not hungry). Last year, when covid first started and my country went through its first lockdown, I was going through one of the worst periods of my life. I was suicidal and could barely do anything. Naturally, I wasn't eating at all. I live in a muslim country though, and it coincided with ramadan (fasting month), so my family wasn't really worried. I was also working on my capstone and could only work with a nocturnal sleeping schedule, so they just assumed I was eating when they were asleep. I was also obsessively working out. I lost xx kgs during that period and i've never gotten so many compliments. Neighbors i've never spoken to and distant acquaintances were telling me how better I looked after losing the weight. I happily took the compliments and ignored the fact that not eating fucked up my body and my physical and mental health. Fast forward a couple of months, I'm done with my capstone, I'm doing a master's and I'm heavily stressed. I stopped working out. I kept the weight for a bit, and I stupidly thought ""maybe my metabolism is working great now"". But the more stressed I got, the more I ate, and the more weight I gained. I started to hide food in my closet and binge eat it in hiding and then cry afterwards (this is one of those instances rn). It is now a year later after i lost the weight and I gained more than half of it back. I've never hated my body more. And I have no one to talk to about it. Every single one of my friends (even my boyfriend) is skinny. I have a best friend with whom I had shared my struggles last year, but I can't bring myself to talk to her about this right now. I know she would never judge me but I'm so terrified of her thinking that i'm a disgusting pig that i would just rather her think that i'm still starving myself. Ramadan is in 2 weeks and all i can think about is ""maybe I can get back on track !! maybe i'll be able to lose that weight again!!"" (disclaimer : pls no one make any comments about how this month is not about weight loss. i know. leave me be.).

However, the past two weeks my thoughts are exactly like how they were at the peak of my ED. I am constantly thinking about what i'm eating and what i look like. My brain is telling me to not eat, and i feel guilty when i do. Also, I would lift weights while I was recovered, and that was really good for me, but now I can feel that I'm starting to think of that like working out to get skinny.

TW EATING DISORDER: When I was younger my parents regularly fed me fast food (around 4-5 times a week) and fed me very unhealthy food, like candy, and never taught me the importance of eating healthy to be healthy. I was a chubby kid and hated myself more than I could say.

 I started to hate food and saw it as an enemy and a punishment. It started with skipping breakfast, then lunch, then eating dinner later then eventually I was only eating lunch at the age of 8 which was a salad with no dressing. My weight dropped significantly. I despised my parents and saw them as monsters who only ever ate junk. Examples: my dad would be driving and would shove a kit kat into his mouth, whenever I walked by him he was stuffing his mouth with chips and unhealthy food. This caused my eating disorder to spike and me to only have around a handful of carrots a day and water. 

It was around that time when I was admitted to a hospital for my eating disorder and my recent suicide attempt that month at the age of 11. I was severely underweight. When I was in the hospital I felt extremely sick after eating a full meal. I felt like I shouldn't feel this way just because of my parents and they thought my body dysmorphia had nothing to do. I felt like an evil human and on top of that severely depressed and suicidal.

 When I was discharged from the hospital my parents barely cared about what I ate. The only thing I ever got was if I had not eaten in 2 days they would remind me to eat and never said anything about skipping meals and did nothing to help me become healthy and get over my eating disorder by getting the stuff the nurses said I should get to help me. 

To this day I'm confused if it was my fault for seeing my parents like that and if it was all my fault, can someone please help?",Request: Seeking advice on my ED,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/mr2kq2/request_seeking_advice_on_my_ed/,1618463885,14-04-21 18:18

Calling your parents back home about dinner.
You lie quickly; but it's alright. 
Because you're filled with desire to be thinner, 
So instead you tell them about you being a winner. 

But deep inside 
All you see are red alarms;
All you can feel are floppy arms. 
Thighs that squish when you sit, 
You're only capable enough to devour a banana split. 

23/1
That was her setting up the gun. 
Please, she begged, 
No salt, no sugar - 
Otherwise she would pull her own trigger 
Dairy, gluten, meat free ~
Convinced herself she had each and every allergy. 

You walk with friends too, 
Trying to turn the topic away from the Italian restaurant last night:
Which you didn't attend to - 
Because you daren't take a bite. 

Everybody is wrong! 
They want me to be weak. 

You know you're strong 
And that effervescent Vitamin C may save the hair. 
That, which falls uncontrollably, 
While your arms make you look like a grizzly bear. 

You run fast, 
With all your strength and might - 
Hoping that the consciousness will last
To overcome your spite
Atleast, till that 10K point - 
Please, before your body falls towards a white light. 

This is a diet. 
Everyone does it, right? 
But soon you realise, it has become your lifestyle - 
Nobody treats themself this vile. 

But was that better than the spinach and kale
Which she engulfed like water 
To make herself full? 
Or the days she confessed her drug, 
Was having the ability to live off nothing but air and a mug. 

She cried:
''Why can't I be beautiful? 
Why can't I be perfect? 
Why can't I be the example my parents always wanted?''

It taught her to lie, 
To all she had loved. 
Abused her till she was nothing, 
But tired, bruised and shoved. 
It was a ruthless queen, 
Whose reign lasted long. 
It's demands grew quiet, 
And soon she wished her gone. 

She paused as she took a breath in, 
Realising. 
She might have just been
Everything she wanted all along 
And that she was worth living. 

Oh this feeling,
The feeling of achievement, 
It sure feels like healing 
After endless months of torment. 

Suddenly, getting up meant 
No more adjusting and holding on tight 
To the bed
So that she could see straight:
And it felt just so right. 

She smiled, she cheered 
Basically towards everything and everyone - she eliminated her fears. 
Pancakes or porridge today? 
She ate everything like it was a buffet! 

Slowly, all felt good. 
She found she could have a mighty laugh according to her mood. 
Recovery isn't one for a struggler, 
But thank goodness she was a hustler. 

She continued snacking day and night, 
But this time, she could see the right light. 
In the mirror she saw purely hope and joy, 
Not someone she wanted to destroy. 

So today I continue this journey of loving myself, 
So please, you too, make sure you don't hate yourself. 
You are precious, you don't have to hide. 
Look up at yourself in utmost pride.

When she eats with me or other family, she eats a reasonable amount and digests it fine, but when she's alone she eats very very little and sips dry white wine or watered down Gatorade all day. Her memory is going, but more recently her hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows have been falling out and we're concerned it's malnutrition. She's always cold, but I chalk that up mostly to just being 80 years old.  

She's very thin, but she still avoids high calorie foods because according to her ""a moment on the lips is a lifetime on the hips"" and she'll eat even less on days that we have meals together so that she can ""justify"" the calories. She's been a very light eater since her Crohn's diagnosis, but it's getting to the point she's eating less than the doctors recommend, not because her stomach is bothering her but because she's worried about gaining weight. I've never had an ED but I have had friends who have struggled with it and I've read up a little about it, and the more time I spend with her the more of these seem like ED habits. I'm concerned the low nutrition she's giving her body will worsen her memory, her stomach, and any other issues that will come to her as she grows older. 

I've tried leaving food for her, but if it's more than a small portion she takes it to her neighbor. Her usual foods are blueberries, turkey slices, crackers, and canned chicken soup.

A lot of weight, not noticeable on me but on the scale definitely. 

I've always had a problem with food though, since I was a kid. I've grown up with people telling me to eat more, not be so picky, I'm so skinny, etc. My teachers and other adults would often force me to eat and sit with me for hours until my parents would have to pick me up, I was always crying. At home, we would mostly eat fast food or easy dinners since my parents were both injured and working a lot.

Now I'm grown up, and living together with my SO. He comments often on my bad eating habits, but his family is ruthless. They're always nagging and joking about me. His grandparents mocked me for not eating a very abstract cultural food.

Result is that I don't have an eating pattern, I never eat breakfast or lunch, I only eat candy and snacks obsessively, I weigh myself 2 times a day and get really upset after doing so, I restrict few days in a row, then I binge, and recently I have started voluntarily throwing up after a meal cause I don't want to deal with the consequences of a bloated stomach or weightgain. I absolutely hate myself and my body, and the confusion of eating food. I have been dealing with this for my entire life and I'm so tired.

It started off pretty healthy with a small calorie deficit, regular strength training and a mix of low intensity and moderate/high intensity cardio a few times a week. However, I feel like it’s getting out of control and I don’t really know how to stop it? I started doing a lot of exercise in the winter (multiple hours a day including an hour relatively intense cardio, with one rest day where I still get 12-15k steps), and kept myself in a calorie deficit. The list of foods I would allow myself to eat kept shrinking, but I still ate a decent amount, maybe a bit low for my amount of exercise. I decided to go off birth control in the fall and have not had a period since then, despite not having any irregularities before going on it. The holidays hit and I let myself eat all the treats but since then have struggled with cravings, loss of motivation for my exercise and healthy eating, and have really struggled with my body. My weight hovers a few pounds above where it was pre-holidays but it’s not even really about weight, I just hate how I look. I also have found that instead of sticking to my relatively low calorie and healthy diet, I’ve started trying to eat as little as possible. The only way I have a good day is if I eat the absolute least amount possible. Eating less has made my cravings worse and I’ve started eating more unhealthy foods when I’m absolutely starving. I don’t think it’s always in a “binge” because I’m genuinely hungry a lot of the time. I used to eat fruit for breakfast, a low cal snack/meal in the mid-afternoon, and then one large meal in the evenings. I’ve always been such a night-eating person so that really worked for me, but I started feeling guilty about my lunch so I stopped eating that, and then I started eating a smaller nighttime meal. Both of those have made me “binge” or overeat a bit, and I always feel guilty about that, but now my issue is that I feel guilty every time I eat? I can’t eat fruit during the day anymore because I get mad at myself. When I eat the full amount of calories I’ve given myself for the day, without overeating, I’m mad! But every time I don’t eat that amount, I either get super hungry and overeat or I’m shaking the next day or waking up through the night. I started using a sleep aid to avoid eating, but I feel like that’s unhealthy so I’ve tried to stop doing it, but I actually feel worse about the fact that I’m eating when I could just force myself to sleep and save the calories. 

My weight is healthy and I’m not even looking to get really thin, although some days (when I struggle the most) I tell myself I couldn’t get small enough. I found a love for fitness and was LOVING getting stronger and leaner on my weight loss journey and loved going for walks and stuff but now I’m so low energy and it’s all unpleasant. Everything was better when I was eating a bit more, in terms of looks, feeling, performance, mood, literally everything, but I cannot get out of this guilt trap. I definitely want to stop overeating and I keep going back and forth between focusing on not overeating, and focusing on not feeling guilty for eating anything at all. I’m also afraid to get my period back because that tells me I’m not working hard enough which doesn’t even sound logical when I say it, but it’s the truth. 

Everyone says I overexercise, don’t eat enough, and have an unhealthy obsession with my health and weight, but I feel like such a failure every time I lose focus on these things and feel like they’ll all be so disappointed in me if I stop working hard. My parents have always been into dieting and their relationship with food and body image isn’t great so I feel like they will think I’m a failure since bigger = worse to them, but they keep saying my definition of “big” is twisted and they just want me to be healthy and less obsessive, and that I’ll stay thin enough because I’m not the type of person who would give up on myself. I was much happier when I was under eating a bit but feeling okay and being consistent. I feel like I couldn’t operate at that high output at the same calorie intake anymore though and I’m afraid and confused by that. I want to return to my healthy eating but I also want food freedom. I’m terrified of gaining weight or looking bigger so I would rather undereat than overeat, but I know that’s obviously a problem too. Does anyone have any advice on how I can find my joy in health again and stop feeling bad about eating? I don’t know if this would be an eating disorder and what kind it would fall under but I’ll read any book, do research, etc, to fix it. 

I feel like I’m fighting two wars and don’t know which one to tackle so any help would be appreciated. I feel like I sound insane and having other peoples’ input has helped me in the past.

I'm a healthy weight and very muscular (for a female) without a lot of physical activity so throughout my life I haven't paid too much attention to weight or body image, but I've always had a strange relationship with food. 

My appetite changes drastically (seemingly) without reason and it's nearly impossible for me to eat when I'm not hungry without either distracting myself and putting a small bowl of snacks in front of me or feeling extremely nauseous and even throwing up sometimes. When it's really bad even the smell of food or the thought of eating will make me nauseous.

They've made it clear that if they do ever completely openly speak about this problem then they don't want me telling anyone because they can't trust anyone else. There are family issues going on and they especially don't want their mom finding out about this as it ""won't be a good idea"".

1887,EDPostRequests,1618998925,mvcagg,"I relapsed at the end of February  when I lost my ESA. She was my best friend and in short, I’ve felt sick  whenever I’ve thought about eating or drinking since she’s been gone. I  didn’t eat and didn’t drink much for a few days after, now I drink  nutrition drinks every day, but I intentionally restrict. My SO bought a  scale even though I told him it would be bad for me. He took it out of  the bathroom and guilt tripped me about it, so I told him to just put it  back. The damage was done by then anyway. I hadn’t regularly weighed  myself for years until then.

This  started with me not focusing on my weight or appearance at all. I was  already struggling with my body image due to post-winter effects, but I  could mostly keep it in check. I stopped eating because my heart felt so  literally broken that I felt sick and couldn’t imagine trying to eat or  drink. This never happened before; I’ve relapsed before, but was always  motivated by weight.

I  tried talking to my doctor and getting therapist referrals, she gave me  this amazing list full of Ed therapists and nutritionists- but only the  nutritionists accept my insurance. I’m a FT student with a disability  and know when I call my insurance, I’m just going to have the same issue  because they don’t update their lists. So I feel a bit defeated. This  morning I found myself on a “pro” site and at that moment I realized I  desperately need to stop. But since the scale is in the bathroom, I’m  obsessed with getting to a certain number and now have anxiety over it.  My SO is trying to lose weight and says he can only do that with the  scale somewhere he sees often.  I’m angry that I am underweight but I  don’t feel like I “look” it. It’s been weighing on me a lot lately.

Today  I went out to buy food. I decided to get baby foods to start myself  back eating again. I’ve been feeling nervous about it, but I can’t get  sucked into that world again like I saw happening earlier. I’m 30 and I  just got back into college, and I just can’t let this keep taking over  my life. Idk how the conversation began, but m

My  bf mentioned how I was “underweight— but not really because those  things are flawed”. A few days ago, he kept picking me up(I normally  have begged my bf throughout the years to pick me up- I’m really short  and he’s very tall) and telling me how light I felt. He was happy about  it. I keep telling him to not get used to it.  

Last  week, he said I was starting to look good lol. Things like that make me  feel like I need to stay this way. But I also don’t want to worsen my  health problems or ruin my life or my health any more than has already  been done.. His comment earlier kind of further made me feel as if he  enjoys me this way and doesn’t find anything wrong with it. When I’d  purge in the past, he hated that, but he doesn’t care when I don’t eat.  Now I feel like it has gone from not caring, to seemingly encouraging it  or egging it on?? Maybe I’m just imagining things because I’m getting  sick again. But I don’t know what to do. Therapists are booked due to  covid’s affect on mental health, nutritionists are even booked months  out, which is normal. I wanted to tackle this myself, but I live miles  away from family, I have no friends, my bf is all I have. I don’t even  have a job, I’m just a FT 30 y/o student. I have nowhere to turn and I  feel like the only support I could have is encouraging my problem or  making it worse and I don’t know what to do. I want to get better, I  want to feel better, but I’m also terrified of gaining weight now,  obsessed with a certain “look” that I struggle to obtain due to my  height, and I feel like living with my bf is making this feel  impossible. He is constantly distracted and if I even try to talk to him  about this or anything serious, he changes the subject or is totally  disengaged. This is really triggering for me because my parents severely  neglected me and I remember wanting help with my ED, but they refused  to take me to therapists,doctors,or nutritionists because they didn’t  want to look bad and for “money” reasons(really this made no sense  because specialists were $5-10 and we weren’t poor”. When I’d try to  talk about my ED and how I could fix things, my mom would scream  unrelated, obscene things at me. Idk how to deal with this again at 30.

 I am 190 cm male, 35 years. I was always well built and had \~xx kg (normal weight) for most of my adult life. Somewhere around 10 years ago I had a terrible breakup with my girlfriend that lasted for 2 years full of physical threats and emotional blackmail, I was on the receiving end obviously. Since then I have developed a mechanism for coping with bad feelings: eating. When I feel bad about something, I eat to feel better. I know perfectly well what I'm doing, and I'm doing it on purpose at times. In the past 8 years I have gotten from to xx kg (obese bmi range), with one period when I lost yykg and then got it back and more. I am now starting to see some consequences in terms of physical fitness or lack of, I have no condition to do anything demanding and I get breathing heavier from climbing 2 stories stairs. I always wanted to stop this and lose the weight, but there is absolutely zero will power in me, just nice wishes. I just ate a sandwitch 2 hours after I had dinner, and I wasn't even hungry. Half did it to feel better, and half kind of to punish myself for not being able to resist it - however cyclic and strange that sounds. Two times I managed to normalize this and lost about weight, which tricked me into thinking it's easy and I can do it again. But lately it seemed to got worse so I can't really control it - when the click in my head happens that I'm going to it - I'm going to it and that's that. 

I have a family and kids and I'd want to remain healthy as much as possible for them, but I can't seem to do anything about it. I'm afraid I won't be there for them if I continue like this, due to sickness or worse.

It would be idiotic to ask ""what to do about it"" when the answer is ""stop being a lazy ass and put yourself together"". Apparently I can't.

It wasn't until recently, after being in my relationship and the instances with the really thin girl (she would always snapchat my boyfriend, all his friends think she's attractive, he called her an affectionate nickname in front of me, she's friends with the rude girl) that these issues came back. I remember seeing her wear a silk midi skirt with a sweatshirt (I love fashion). And I bought the same skirt because I thought the outfit was cute, and it looked completely different on me. Because I'm shorter and I have wider hips it didn't look the way I wanted it to. That made me really upset. Then my antidepressants would suppress my appetite, so over the summer when I went to Asia I lost a lot of weight, I weighed less than I did in middle school. My mom would yell at me and tell me I look anorexic and that my hair looks thinner because I'm not eating enough and that I need to eat more because it looks better if I don't ""look like an African child."" But that summer, I got more compliments than I ever did in that country. My aunts, my hairdresser, my pilates instructor all commented on how skinny I was. I was always considered ""slim"" or ""skinny"" by American standards, but by Asia standards not as much. It felt so good. I was working out twice a week and eating one full meal a day and then some bread. I had never been happier with my body. Sure it kind of concerned me that you could see my ribs but I was skinny - maybe even skinnier than that girl. 

Then fall rolls around, I'm eating more and healthier but I'm still less than I usually weigh. Then I go off my antidepressants and I would get really bad munchies when smoking weed with my boyfriend and I was home over winter break so I started eating a lot more. I could see myself gaining more weight and I started to panic, also because I was staying with my boyfriend and the mentions of the really skinny girl by all of his friends and everything just really triggered me. 

It feels the worst now than it ever does before. I feel so guilty whenever I eat and I vow to not eat as much the next day. I constantly look at my body in the mirror. I see thin girls on TikTok and it severely triggers me, it makes me feel horrible about myself. Even though my parents are Asian and they have criticized everything else about my physical appearance, they've never told me once to lose weight b/c my usual weight is healthy. But I don't want to look ""healthy"" I want to look skinny. I don't want to be like all bones because I know that is obviously very unhealthy, but the line between unhealthy and healthy skinny is so thin to me. It's like I want to be on the brink of it because I want the thinness of the models. I also feel like even if I am always skinny, I don't even feel that way. I always notice a part of my body that could lose more weight. I'm just constantly aiming for my summer body. 

I'm back on my antidepressants but I'm so terrified to switch to an SSRI because I've heard they make you gain weight. If I'm hungry I'm not great at controlling myself, so I really need the suppressant to keep my eating at the minimum I want it to be. I don't know how to fix everything because tbh my therapist isn't very helpful. I constantly compare myself to girls who eat less than me or are skinnier than me and I just strive to achieve it all the time. 

To be honest, I think no matter how much treatment I get I'm always going to want to be skinny, and nothing will change that.",Request: Request for post: I think I have a eating disorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/mtwshj/request_request_for_post_i_think_i_have_a_eating/,1618845627,19-04-21 4:20
1894,EDPostRequests,1618823955,mtwruk,"Hi everyone,

So I have been in therapy for about two months to deal with some disordered eating behaviours. It all started about a year ago during the start of the pandemic where I wanted to lose a few pounds, I started exercising 6 times a week &amp; intermittent fasting however not eating nearly enough. I lost weight and got a lot of compliments &amp; during the summer I fell into a binge period where I was stuffing myself beyond full multiple times a week and gained the weight back and more, and people noticed. This lead me to calories counting &amp; restricting which I felt I had control over until I didn’t and had more binge urges, and obsessive food thoughts. I am/was thinking about food almost every second of the day, I do things in between meals not because I enjoy them but because I want to waste time so I can eat my next meal. This has gotten mentally exhausting and I don’t know how to stop it. 

This led me to seek therapy &amp; I have only had a few sessions and I know it doesn’t work that fast, but I still can’t help but feel discouraged. I am confused on what my behaviour encompasses, my psychotherapist has not actually diagnosed with me with anything but has said things such as “eating disorder” and “disordered eating”. I know I could ask to clarify but I have really bad anxiety that is stopping me &amp; stressing me out about asking it. Any advice on how to approach it, or your thoughts about my possible disorder would be helpful.",Request: In therapy but confused,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/mtwruk/request_in_therapy_but_confused/,1618845555,19-04-21 4:19

1896,EDPostRequests,1618823925,mtwrn3,"Hello everyone. I recently have met someone and became very close to them. They opened up to me about being bulimic which shocked me that she had an ed but also they felt comfortable enough to tell me. I adjusted some of the things I talk about with them as in I make less jokes about my own weight since I am a larger person and I have stopped talking about food as much as well since cooking is something I am passionate about. 

I want to be a supportive friend but I've never had someone be open with me about an ED and I only have a passing knowledge of them. It's definitely a learning curve but I want to do my absolute best I can. Was I correct about stopping talking about about my own weight and food? I didn't stop completely talking about it because I know that would be suspicious, I more make comments about how I'm comfortable with my weight and I've cut down on the jokes and negative aspects. Same with food, I used to ask her questions about food because like I said before I'm passionate about cooking. I know basically just tell her what I've had to eat and if they tell me what they've had I feel like that normalises it a little bit more.

The main reason I come to this sub Reddit seeking advice is because yesterday I had a message out of the blue from them saying they felt ugly and would like to loose more weight. This did scare me as it's a tricky topic to talk about. I basically said that I support with their choice but I wish I also told them to be careful and I was worried but I thought that would make things worse. She went on to tell me about how they've lost a large amount of weight but stopped. I was supportive of this because the amount of weight that was lost but her in a healthy spot. She then told me she wants to lose the same amount which is when I got really concerned but sadly I didn't know what to say in that situation. Over the next 20 minutes I slowly tried to shift the conversation to something else to make things a little more light hearted but the whole time I was worried.

Please feel free to ask questions or lend me some advice because all will be put to good use. Thank you everyone for reading and I hope you have a good day.",Request: Title: My friend has an ED.

I've (27NB/AFAB) struggled with disordered eating my entire adult life. It's never been about losing weight or being thinner, but moreso ""the texture of this food is going to make me sick if I don't get it out of my mouth NOW"" (and it will if I don't; I've tried to power through it and had bad results everytime), and that combined with depression, I rarely have the effort to find something 'safe' to eat, because it can easily take me an HOUR to find something, let alone prep/cook time. So I've spent most of my adult life just... not really eating. I'll eat eventually, but only because I know I can't physically keep going if I don't, or I rarely have enough energy to deal with the whole process of finding something 'safe' to eat. I usually just eat a few bites of dinner, so my boyfriend doesn't question me much, and that's it. 

And my safe foods are constantly changing, and it feels like just as I start to find a few things I can reliably eat, it starts giving me that awful 'wrong, bad, going to make you sick' feeling. It doesn't even matter if it's something I LOVE the taste of; once my brain decides it doesn't ""feel right"" in my mouth, I can't eat it for however long until my stupid brain goes 'oh that's okay to eat again!'

It's at the point where it's going to make me seriously, seriously sick soon. I'm 5'4 and I haven't weighed in at triple digits in almost a year.  I'm already noticing some of the first 'bigger' warning signs in my body. I can't keep living on energy drinks, advil, and a couple bites of food a day. And I really don't want to- I'm tired of being exhausted and feeling like shit ALL the time. But I have absolutely no idea how to deal with this. I'm at the point where I almost want to just say ""screw it you stupid brain, you win, enjoy a slow death"". Especially because NOBODY I talk to understands what it's like to want to eat, but not being able to.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to hear of anyone else’s experience around managing an eating disorder while having a full time job..

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I was diagnosed with ARFID/OSFED in February 2021 and have been going through pretty crappy “cycles” (as I call them) every 2 weeks or so where food is very overwhelming and I am struggling to stomach anything, therefore making me more anxious, lack of energy/concentration etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I am a team leader for a small group of researchers, I’m currently working from home but the majority of my work day revolves around zoom meetings and giving presentations. When things get REALLY bad, my anxiety makes me nauseous and I vomit so there were times last week where I would log into work, be very ill for an hour or so, then brush it off and pretend nothing happened and smile for the zoom call....

&amp;#x200B;

I had to tell my boss about my eating disorder as the vomiting got so bad, I was admitted to hospital for emergency checks to make sure I wasn’t dehydrated, blood pressure was all good etc etc. ANYWAY, my referral for an eating disorder specialist is currently getting fast tracked as a result and I am really unsure of what I should do about work. In all honestly, work is manageable most of the time since I’m working from home, it’s easier to ‘conceal’ it, however I am slightly worried that once my therapy starts I won’t have the headspace to be able to juggle both work and therapy and I may get worse before I get better.

1901,EDPostRequests,1618793703,mtpmti,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

It’s been kinda a rough day and I wanted to write something down to help me with the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Short summary: My partner and I have been together for around 9 years now, been living together after 1 year already. After a year she told me she has been having bulimia for about 3 years and anorexia a couple of years before that. I was totally oblivious and I didn’t really knew it was so serious, but I wanted to help her any way that I can. Years go by and eventually she got rid of bulimia. She kinda developed binge eating disorder afterwards but at least the purging stopped, which was taking a big toll on her body. I was always there to support her, and of course I was hoping some day to have a semi normal relationship, in a way that we have problems and we solve them and other problems occur and we solve them together. About three years ago she got rid of the binge eating disorder with big effort, but nuggets of ED still remained, which is normal I guess. She said and still says she no longer has any ED, but I don’t know. Here lie our difficulties. Every day a lot of our conversations are about her weight, her looks, her eating patterns and how bad/not perfect it was. I’m sure she would correct me now saying there are days that she doesn’t speak about it and that there are days that are good, but they seem lost to me in a sea of bad. It just feels that way. She only eats the most healthy food, and if she eats something bad like a chip or a piece of bread or something it’s cheating. She mostly eats volume with lots of vegetables and all kinds of stevia products and meat replacer (which is good), but it’s all kind of stuff thrown together. She will defend her food saying normal is different for everyone, but we can never eat the same stuff. We never eat together, we never go out to eat. We can never go to friend or family and eat something together (only in certain circumstances where she controls her food and what she eats). It sucks that eating together is kinda socially normal and I long for that sometimes. It’s been 9 years now so it’s become normal to me but still. She also seems very obsessed with steps. Every day she tries to get at least 30,000 to 40,000 steps on her treadmill, often getting angry when something obstructs her goal. We don’t do much together anymore accept go walking outside. She also weightlifts, which I encourage, but whenever something comes in between, then again she gets angry. And because she weightlifts almost every day, it’s quite possible something comes in between.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this seems like me ranting, and I guess it is. It’s all one sided so I must apologize I cannot give her stance on this subject. It will for sure be totally different, and possible she would attack me saying I’m all wrong. But this is how it feels to me. The days I would give advice she follows are long gone. It seems like nothing works anymore. But she thinks most is normal and her problems are minor and will be fixed in the near future. I don’t know. I don’t know what other would do in my situation and if I am doing right. I don’t know anything anymore. I’m just kinda flowing with the river, not knowing where to go and what to do.

I guess I started eating less and being more aware of calories because of the environment I was in, but I was still eating 3 meals a day just less snacks, but still some. Obviously I didn’t need to lose weight but I started exercising and running and eventually fell underweight. The whole summer I kept up running, I was still eating regularly and not exactly starving myself, just was more aware of calories than I have been before. Anyway the start of this year I have just been eating whatever I want pretty much, like eating more dessert and stuff. But since February I’ve been constantly hungry. Like nothing fills me up like it used to and I even feel hungry in the night and starving when I wake up. I’m hungry so much more than I used to be even tho I’ve always had a big appetite.

1906,EDPostRequests,1618687011,msx30e,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I \[F23\] am searching for some general guidance as even after reading some of the stickied threads around here and doing some general research I still feel unsure about whether I might qualify as having an ED. As an additional disclaimer, I am set to start therapy for a variety of reasons in a few weeks so I will receive professional insight soon too, I'm just hoping to get some preliminary clarity before then as I am struggling to feel valid in pursuing professional help.

I have a menagerie of ED-like symptoms that could also be metabolic/thyroid related or depression/anxiety but seem to also have some psychological components similar to EDs. Based on what I've read, it could be an EDNOS but it seems like a lot of folks with EDNOS have body image issues, calorie counting habits, or binging/purging behaviors, none of which I exhibit. That being said I am 5'6"" and recently dropped into the double digits on weight and am starting to experience a lot of physical side effects like chronic fatigue, almost daily pressure headaches, etc so I made the decision to talk to a professional. Some of what I experience includes:

* Little to no hunger drive/cues during the day, may snack out of boredom or eat one meal late in the day. If I only ate when I experienced hunger cues, it could be a full day or multiple days before I felt the need to eat. I never calorie counted until recently and only began to actually try to motivate myself to eat /more/ as I kept track out of curiosity one day and I was horrified to see how little I was eating daily.
* Sometimes when I do feel hungry enough to cook, I will begin cooking and then lose my appetite while cooking, just after sitting down to eat, or after only a bite or two of food even if I thought I was hungry or wanted to eat initially. Sometimes the smell of cooking food will make me feel nauseous and sick even if I was hungry before I started cooking.
* Food often never tastes as good as I think it will. Tastes ""bland"" or ""colorless"" even when it's a recipe I enjoyed at one time.
* I sometimes will only enjoy a specific meal once or twice before it completely loses appeal and I never desire to eat it again. Few foods are always appetizing, mainly sushi and poke are more consistently appealing.
* Frequent indigestion/upset stomach first thing in the morning and sometimes diarrhea. My stomach growls a lot during the day and I feel generally nauseous a lot but that nausea doesn't go away when I eat/have food in front of me.
* Constant fatigue, only awake for a few hours before feeling like I need a nap/brain fog. Sometimes sleep/nap for 3-5 hours during the day even if I slept 8+ hours the night before. Muscles often feel achy and sore but I don't exercise.
* Cold all the time, bad circulation. I will wear sweaters even if its 75+ degrees outside
* I am a bit obsessive about spending as little on food as possible each month and feel more accomplished the less money I spend on food. I'll spent long amounts of time in the grocery store carefully examining which brands have the best price per ounce, etc. One month I spent only 50$ the entire month on food and felt proud. I am in no way poor and could easily afford 250$ a month in groceries if I wanted.
* Sometimes I will set goals like making myself eat everything I have left in the fridge before buying groceries again, even if nothing I have qualifies as a meal. Sometimes this can take a while so I might go a week or two with very little groceries (i.e. eating spoonfulls of peanut butter for dinner for a few nights) before I am able to finish everything off.
* Sometimes I use food as a reward system and will only buy groceries after getting a good grade on a test/completing an assignment. In contrast, if I perceive myself as having been lazy I tend to punish myself by not allowing myself to spend money on food or feeling like I ""don't deserve food"".
* I do struggle with depression and anxiety but tend to come across as ""high functioning"". I've been invalidated a lot by friends and family over the years and have never really felt taken seriously. Sometimes I feel like maybe if I get physically sick enough or look sick enough people will finally take me seriously/ finally believe I am not well. Feeling physically ill feels a little like an accomplishment, like it is making my internal problems ""real"" and undeniable, and I admit that even though appearance wise I would like to gain weight, when I look at the scale and see I've dropped another pound I do feel a sense of excitement, like perhaps this is the point where someone will finally validate the seriousness of how I feel or actually worry about me/care. This aspect often makes me feel awful as I feel like I must be doing this for attention, which makes me feel slimy and worse about myself.

Things I DON'T do

* I don't really stress about controlling how much, where, how, when eating happens. I just eventually eat sometimes or eat because I realize I haven't in a while and probably should.
* Stress about my body image/want to be skinnier. I think my body looks rather gross and unappealing underweight and I would happily gain weight appearance wise.
* I don't feel disgusted/panicky about any specific foods, it seems like the revulsion/nausea I feel around food sometimes is pretty generalized and nonspecific and changes a lot.
* I've never purged and rarely binge unless I've gone a few days without eating and don't have any guilt associated with binging.
* Counted calories in an attempt to reduce calorie intake.
* Over exercised-- in fact I hardly exercise or leave the house at all these days.

To me, a lot of these could just be symptoms of depression/anxiety which I also struggle with and has been known to mess with appetite. I just feel like I can't parse anything out and I suppose I am just looking to see if anyone can relate or has experienced anything similar as I've had trouble finding accounts of any similar experiences/sets of symptoms.

1909,EDPostRequests,1619679016,n0yon5,"After years of restrictive eating, into laxative abuse, diet fads, pills, fasting, purging while restricting, and bingeing without purging (never felt full, always just felt empty — it was depression emptiness and I didn’t know then), I got diagnosed with atypical anorexia yesterday. 

For a moment, it made sense. I finally had a name to the awfulness that I consistently felt about my body and weight, after long last, over 15 years later. I had eating and body image issues for the longest time, except I felt it was normal seeing as I was a fat person. My stomach constantly grew in size (in my perspective). As a 23 year old, I haven’t been in a healthy weight range nor underweight (per BMI) for maybe 15 of those years. I still am not, today. 

It was last year, in the midst of deep depression and watching way too much youtube in bed, that i started to realise how my meals in a day were much less than normal. I would see What I Eat In A Day videos and realise that a person’s one single meal out of three would still amount to more than everything that I’d let myself eat in an entire day. And even then, I still felt the need to starve myself even more. 

But very quickly after the words ‘atypical anorexia’ came out, did the competitiveness start. I started thinking — what a failure, i couldn’t even lose enough weight to have ‘actual’ anorexia. My ECG results showed sinus tachycardia and borderline right axis deviation, which was otherwise considered normal, and I was frustrated that I hadn’t ruined myself enough to have low blood pressure, bradycardia, risk of heart failure (i struggle with suicide too, and it seemed inviting) — was I not starving myself enough? Even when I knew that my higher blood pressure and tachycardia is possibly the result of being on the riskiest dose of Effexor XR (at 350mg, where it increases blood pressure), I felt so disappointed that I couldn’t even get sick enough. 

I’d lost 21% of my body weight within a year, but yet have still been well above the healthy BMI range. 21% is significant, I guess, but I’m also still in an 82% surplus of my ideal weight (less than half of my highest weight), and still want to lose more. 

I feel like such a disturbed person for feeling like I need to be doing worse, despite anorexia being one of the illnesses with the highest morbidity and mortality rate. The competitiveness is ridiculous. And even after saying all this, and being told by my ED psychiatrist that I should remind myself to eat more, I can’t help but feel even more determined to eat even less, because I’m so mad that I’m not doing worse than I already am. 

But I have a dietician and a physiotherapist to see now. I don’t know how it’s supposed to work. What if the dietician wants me to eat more meals, and that makes me gain weight again? What would a physiotherapist do in this case? I have such trouble exercising after building a really bad relationship with it years back, only made worse by depression and absolute lethargy (walking for a few minutes already makes my back and legs and core feel painfully sore). I don’t know what to expect from seeing a dietician and physiotherapist in this case. 

I’m just so confused, and discouraged, and the competitive ED voice is just so annoyingly loud right now.","Request: I have atypical anorexia, but wish I was sicker.

1910,EDPostRequests,1619679006,n0yojz,"Hi! Not sure if I’m over reacting. I’ve always been the type to not eat when I’m stressed because I don’t have an appetite. As I’ve gotten older, I realized that when I get busy I avoid eating because I’m scared it’ll make me sleepy. When I have assignments I will go 3-4 days without eating food. I guess lack of appetite is a normal response to stress. 

The part that worries me is that I’ll feel hunger and actively avoid eating. I feel repulsed at the sight of food. When family or friends force me to eat, I have a breakdowns because I feel like it’s undeserved and a form of punishment and taking away from productivity. When I do end up eating during those really stressful times, I feel like a failure. A part of me thinks it’s an accomplishment when I don’t eat. I don’t think this is weight related. Anyway, when the stressful periods are over I usually go back to my normal eating habits, but even then I wait until I’m really hungry or have 1-2 small meals a day. Sometimes when I am on those 2-3 days without food, I’ll order food knowing I should eat but I just throw it out without touching it.  The other day I went 3 days without eating while working on a paper, hoping that I’d pass out and could get out of school with a legit reason. This isn’t the first time a thought like this has crossed my mind, but I guess this is the first time I’ve actively tried to. I ended up caving and ordering food, but I felt like I failed myself in the process. I haven’t eaten since then and I have no desire to. I think I use “I’m stressful I can’t eat” as an excuse, and it may very well start off like that, but then it turns into active starving until I feel like eating again.

1913,EDPostRequests,1619596199,n09pfz,"Hi all! 

I’m writing this because I honestly don’t know what to do. I’ve been struggling to eat.. honestly anything for the last month/last 2 months. I don’t really know what triggered me so badly, but I feel guilty whenever I eat. I don’t see food as ‘oh yummy, food!’ anymore but as carbs, calories and sugar that will make me fat and I hate that I think about food this way. 

I am very good at hiding it, whenever I’m with other people I just eat, doesn’t matter how much or if it’s healthy or unhealthy, but all I can think about when I eat (especially something with a lot of sugars/calories/carbs) is how this will affect my weight and my body. Let’s just say that if I would be alone 24/7, I would probably only eat breakfast for the entire day and that’s it (which is so dangerous). 

I also just feel guilty when thinking about things I love (or loved) to eat, like chocolate and I can’t imagine people eating something just because they like it. For example, my friend was eating a chocolate bar while we were in a Zoom meeting, and all I could think about is how she could eat something like that without feeling guilty. That’s when I realized there’s something very wrong and dangerous about my mindset, not with her just enjoying her food. 

I downloaded this one app a few days ago that gives you advice on how many calories you should have, and I’ve been tracking it like CRAZY, almost obsessive, so I think that triggered me even more. I absolutely hate myself when I eat more than the recommended amount of calories and wanna punish myself the day after.

So, I know this is very complicated, maybe too complicated for a simple Reddit post, but can someone please give me some advice on how I can stop caring so so so much about carbs, sugars and calories so I can eat whatever I want.

1914,EDPostRequests,1619592376,n08vpq,"Hello. I have been living with an eating disorder for as long as I can remember. When it started, I can't recall, but it was brought forth to fruition around three years ago when I first became underweight.

I realize that numbers are irrelevant, not to mention that speaking of them is not permitted here, so I will not use any.

Needless to say, I began falling into a dark place, one which I remain in to this day.

I feel cold, tired, depressed, un-motivated every minute of every hour until it is time to eat which I only do once a day. I practice fasting. My life is absolute hell, and all for what, for what I perceive to be a good looking body which I can't even show off to anyone because not only do I fear judgment but also that I am not good enough, and because I want to refrain from furthering this problem. I do not wish this fate upon anyone.

I have been poisoned by the internet, more specifically social media.

According the scale and observations from other people, my body fat is very low, but I don't see it. I try to convince myself that it's all in my head but I can't. I can't do it. I want to but I can't is something that a lot of people including those who actually care about my well-being fail to understand.

The idea that I don't want to change is not true. I remember a time when I was happy and I want to recover that.

I have no motivation, I look forward to nothing. I'm a big video-game and film enthusiast, but now whenever I engage in them it just feels like I'm doing it for the sake of having to complete it. 

I've lost my fire, my drive is gone, I feel like I'm just clinging on to life at this point and not really living.

Physically, I suffer from anemia, low blood pressure, my body temperature is bellow to normal range and get sick often.

I've done all the research, on the health and nutrition sides, I know most of the facts regarding this matter but I can't convince myself to change. I don't know what I want.

I feel alone. I feel desperate. I just want to be happy again.

Before 2018, I remember always being insecure about my body-image. I began caring more and more towards the later part of my teen years and got into exercising and eating healthy, but back then it wasn't as bad, back then I had it under control.

My friend started dieting and that convinced me to hop on the train although my body-weight was already low. But no one stopped me, at least no one truly did. They just said I looked skinny, one friend even suggested intermitted fasting which made it even worse although he saw that I was underweight and experiencing symptoms. I don't blame them but I wish they could have realized that they were encouraging my behaviors.

I have absolutely no energy, going for a walk and doing daily chores is a hassle and every day I feel like I got hit by a bus.

I live in Canada, and the winters are absolute hell. Usually I keep my heater on at 28c, which makes it hard to breathe but my body is always freezing.

What do I do? How do I deal with this? I feel like I've tried everything. 

I know this seems dark, but my life has some positive moments. I have a few friends and a family. I don't speak to them about this because I feel embarrassed about the situation and I don't want to trigger anyone. 

The only person I talk to about this is my mom. I set up a Doctor's appointment for next week, but I feel like I need the attention right now.

I'm sorry if this seemed triggering in any way. Please do not fall into the same trap I did. It is not worth it, not worth it at all. I feel more unhappy than I've ever been.

1916,EDPostRequests,1619505180,mzi88h,"So, I’m not sure whether I qualify as having an eating disorder, but I definitely have some majorly messed up eating patterns that I want to change. A little under a decade ago after a majorly messed up experience with a healthcare provider during my senior year of college, I decided I was going to “lose weight”. I of course did this in the most unhealthy way possible and crash dieted. It was bad. I’m super hard on myself and tend to view anything less than perfection as failure. Once I learned how to track calories, it was all over. 

Over the last several years I’ve been up and down. I started doing CrossFit and I ended up getting into really great shape. I’m proud of how fit I am now; I can deadlift hundreds of pounds and run a half marathon for fun. During this “getting fit” process, however, I also learned how to count macros instead of just calories... Add a little more fuel to the fire, why don’t you? 

I’m here because I’m just SO. FREAKING. TIRED. I workout every single day, and I obsess over tracking my food. I’m eating “enough” (just a little bit under maintenance), but my body is clearly unhappy. I’m exhausted all the time, and I’m constantly hungry. If I give myself a “day off” tracking, even if I try to be “reasonable” I end up beating myself up for “eating too much”. (Like literal tears by the end of the night sometimes.) 

I want to stop this cycle but I don’t know how to get out. There is definitely a lot of fear associated with gaining weight — I remember how terribly I used to be treated and I don’t want to “go back”. But from the outside looking in, it probably doesn’t look like there’s a problem and might even seem like I’m just “being healthy”. I eat a reasonable amount; I’m at the top end of normal/low end of overweight; I workout daily. Some people might call it healthy habits, except it’s clearly NOT maintainable. 

It’s taking a huge mental toll to feel like I’m a “bad person who can’t be trusted around food” and I think I’m being “lazy” if I’m not giving my diet and exercise regimen 100% at all times. I hate feeling like I’m slacking off and giving up if I step out of line at all. I’m sick of being hungry and tired, and my sex drive is TANKED — not ideal when my husband and I are starting to think about having children.

1917,EDPostRequests,1619480691,mzbe0p,"I’m feeling very down right now and was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar. I sought treatment for my anorexia March 2018 (the amenorrhea started mid 2016 with my periods getting farther and farther apart before that) and got my period back August 2018. It was, genuinely, one of the happiest days of my life. While I was already weight restored and mentally rather sound, my period was the missing puzzle piece. I felt so whole and happy.

Fast-forward to now. I feel so incredibly triggered by what my body is doing. My cycles from January until now have slowly gotten farther and farther apart (similar to last time). The problem is: I’m not restricting. I’m not over-exercising. In fact, I’m eating more and exercising less (contributing to a lot of depression and stress — unrelated to ED. It’s just an eating to eat to escape the stress type of cycle).

I will be calling my doctor to get the ball rolling with blood work, but, man...I feel so defeated. And there is a little voice in my head — ever so quiet, but I hear her — saying that recovery wasn’t even worth it. Now, you weigh so much more. You spent all of that money on new, larger clothes; all of that money on therapy and treatment; for no reason. 

I rationally know this isn’t true. But I feel like that puzzle piece is being taken away from me and it’s hard to separate loss of period from my eating disorder. I know not everyone loses or has irregular periods because they are anorexic...but that’s always been the case for me. 

So NOW I’m sitting here just feeling like garbage because if it’s not due to restriction or over-exertion, that means something else is going on...and that scares me. I guess I just needed to vent and see if anyone has had similar stories. I don’t know if my body is reacting to the recent weight gain/under-exercising plus the stress or what. But. I didn’t realize that a late period would cause all of these emotions and triggers to surface.

I haven’t been actually diagnosed but I’ve struggled with disordered eating for almost two years now. I’m mainly in a binge-restrict cycle that started because
1. Body dysmorphia
2. Abusive parent who would starve me as punishment, and reward me with food.

I’ve only been free from that parent for about a year and have diagnosed PTSD and depression as a result of the abuse. I often disassociate and lose awareness of what I’m doing or have impulse control issues. This, on top of depressive episodes, leads me to have a massive problem with binging. I restrict then to compensate.

I’m wondering if anyone has any advice for tackling this, because the emotional component of binging is quite prominent. I’ve heard from a lot of recovery resources that “there’s no such thing as emotional eating,” “if you’re hungry, eat,” “binging is just the body’s response to restriction.” I’m sure this is true for most people but for me it just doesn’t work.

I haven't had my period for a year and I recently gained a few pounds which I was scary but I was kind of okay with bc I knew I needed to. This morning I weighed in at the borderline between underweight and normal weight. I've been feeling nauseous for a few days which isn't all that abnormal for me since I don't usually feel that great. But a couple hours ago I felt something that felt like my period. I figured it was nothing since i haven't had a period in a year. BUT there was a tiny bit of blood when I went to check in the bathroom. I AM TERRIFIED. I feel so gross and disgusting that my body is doing this and I thought that I wanted my period back but now I just feel so angry at myself for letting this happen.

Recently i've been having weird experiences with food relating to aversion to food, and i wonder if anyone else is or has experienced similar issues. It first started with my favourite foods (like seriously, two of my favourite foods EVER). One of these foods was one that we only really ate occasionally, when we travelled past a specific restaurant (1x or 2x per year MAX.) and when my parents finally found a new butcher shop which sold the appropriate meat mince to make it, we started making it alot more at home. My explanation for this one is that because i wasn't eating only a couple of times per year, my desire for it decreased, we were now having it once every two weeks and i could barely eat half of what i did before. But the other one, that raised some concerns for me, was my most favourite food my mom made, called sarma. We would only have it in the winter when our own sour cabbage was ready. This winter i could barely stand it. I tried to find a similar explanation to the one before but we weren't eating it any more often than any other winter. This happened to some other foods i ate very often - like tuna fish which i used to have every weekend for breakfast for a period of time, and even apples, which i don't hate, but i don't crave them either, i eat them more as a chore to get more fibre. Now i'm noticing more and more that i'm retreating into, and craving SOLELY, sort of ""safe foods"" (don't know if i'm using that correctly), really plain and simple stuff, like bread and butter, spaghetti with 2 ingredient sauces. and whatnot. I don't think it's an unconcious restrictive issue because i still crave a variety of food groups, alot of carbs, fats, fibre and protein. On top of this i'm noticing i mostly actually CRAVE sweet foods such as chocolate and sweets, sometimes also fruits like oranges, bananas, grapes, but i don't really have much of a desire for savoury foods, i just eat them because i have to",Request: i've been having weird experiences with food relating to aversion to food,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/mxvppd/request_ive_been_having_weird_experiences_with/,1619328443,24-04-21 18:27

1933,EDPostRequests,1619220822,mx7xmg,"I'm a 34 male and I've been overweight my entire life. And I have always had an unhealthy relationship with food.

My entire life has been haunted by food. As far back into childhood as I can remember, food has been the monkey on my back, devil on my shoulder, whispering in my ear and offering me validation and comfort when I couldn't find it otherwise.
When I was a kid, I don't know what my parents thought it was. I didn't know what it was, but it would usually manifest itself as late night binges. Wild and out of control, ""waking up"" without really waking up. It was like watching a movie where you yell at the protagonist ""don't do it! Don't go in there!"" but they wouldn't hear or respond. It had to be in my preteen years, and it was always the same. Roll out of bed AT LEAST one time per night, go to the kitchen and eat whatever comforting thing was available. Usually it would be things like cheese, milk, peanut butter, anything indulgent, savory or sweet. But my ultimate downfall was the trophy food; ice cream. Always, if there was ice cream, always, and ALL of it.
My parents bedroom was up some stairs which sat directly next to the kitchen, directly next to the refrigerator. So they could hear what I was doing and could see the light from the fridge I'm sure. Enough times my mother would yell down ""GO BACK TO BED. GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN."" Some times she would come charging down the stairs, a wild furious look in her eyes and on her face and physically escort me back to bed. That wasn't very effective though, it continued no matter what.
It got to the point where my parents literally put a chain and lock around the refrigerator to keep me out, threading it in and around the handles of both the chiller and the freezer. That didn't stop me still, I figured out that if I got any of the doors open JUST far enough, I could fit my arm in far enough to reach a block of cheese, or some leftover pizza, or my precious ice cream from the freezer door.
I was a bigger kid but I was always active, excelled at sports without a ton of effort, but I put in the effort because I genuinely like activity and the feeling you get.
There was plenty of teasing throughout grade school, plenty of cute girls who didn't look my direction, and even on an occasion a conversation took place where I remember my mom making a comment along the lines of another boy being more traditionally handsome than me, but girls like big guys when they get older so don't worry, just wait and see.
Throughout school, until a knee injury changed some things up, I was always active and excelled at sports so I really never saw my eating habits catch up to me (thinking now how I could have been without this fucking demon in my life is a little bit disheartening.)
Things never really changed. Food was great. I loved it. It loved me. Partying, drinking and drugs weren't my thing at all. Food though, that was it. Hanging out with a friend or two and ordering four burgers, a fry, chili and a large soda from a fast food restaurant wasn't uncommon. Or getting an entire box or two of Little Debbie snacks.
My adult life has been filled with fluctuating weights and unhealthy eating habits.
The same thing, mindlessly walking to the fridge night after night, no matter where I am. Its a compulsion and a comfort of some type. I don't know how to explain it.
Sometimes it won't happen and I know it is directly related to my mental health. Typically when I get into a new relationship, it will calm for at most a couple of weeks. Then it starts up again usually. It has absolutely taken a toll and had a very negative effect on romantic relationships. Not my weight, but my habits and compulsions. I have eaten my past partners kids foods, their foods, my foods, anything.
I can't stop once my brain goes on that mode, its just autopilot. I can't stop myself at all. I can say it internally or say it out loud ""stop. stop. stop. this isn't good. stop."" but it just doesn't stop.
Right before the pandemic I lost my driving privileges, then I lost my job, then I didn't leave my bedroom or a pair of sweatpants for almost three months. I found a job that pays more than I have made anywhere else, but I'm fucking broke constantly and its food. No matter what, I will seek out some way to get some kind of bullshit food in my system. And I will spend down to my last dime. Sometimes its just apathetic depression, sometimes I will wake up with an alert ""your food has been delivered"" after what I thought was a dream about ordering food. It is exacerbating my absolute existing depression and making it worse because I SHOULD be fine financially. It's killing me.

I managed to lose some weight after a complete breakdown around Christmas time, and have been engaging in healthier habits, but its still there. I think today was the biggest slap in the face. A weird mental thing for me is to wear ""regular"" pants as often as I can. Most of the other time I wear athletic shorts and a hoodie (I have always done this, regardless of weight or life situation or anything, thats just my casual ""I have nowhere to be"" clothes) or when I go to work I always just wear a pair of athletic shorts/sweats because I have to change clothes before and after my shift so there's no point in dirtying ""regular"" clothes.

Yesterday I got a ride home from my job (I still cannot drive) from my mother, she asked how I was and I relayed that I was feeling down and depressed about a lot of things. She was sympathetic and kind during the conversation
My familial relationship has always been odd. Push and pull a lot, but there is love and support all around. My family has helped me during this pandemic and with things before, and I am forever grateful for that help and love.
But today, I think it hit a wall. I'm broke, whatever state of mind I was in, I literally ordered food down to the last five dollars in my bank account. I asked my parents if they had any spare groceries of any type I could mooch and that must have done it. My mom kind of prodded ""what's going on"" and I thought and felt some shame and said ""ahh never mind, thank you though."" So I rode my bicycle to/from work today, was kind of feeling alright and had some plans this evening.
I got home, parked my bike, and took my dogs out. As they're going I look down the street and see a vehicle bearing down quick as hell for my small residential area, then realize its my mother.
She pulls up and very aggressively asks ""how are you feeling today? Depressed? Sad? Whats going on."" ""Yeah, I mean I feel a lot of the same way I felt yesterday, but I just got home and want to see if I can relax and calm my head for the week.""
""Well, lean over here so no one else hears what I'm telling you. Food can't keep ruining your life. You are so depressed and you bitch about food. You're letting food control you and I don't know what to do but you have to fucking stop.""
""I just want to take my dogs out and go inside."" (I HATE public confrontation, and here's nothing shocking, my mother is a major fucking trigger when she wants to be, and she knows how to do it, but will always have a 'suck it up, my life was hard etc etc' response or attitude)
Here's what made me feel weird and shitty for whatever reason, she offered me money and I refused, then she says in this teeth clenched angry tone ""Sweat pants are a tool of the devil. STOP. WEARING. THEM."" And then peels out away down the street.


I cancelled my plans and just feel like shit, in general. I need to change and I don't know what to do. Food has been a monster that has stalked me and won my entire life, and its a battle with mental health as much as anything else (at this point I can't afford treatment, ha, my family offered to help but they're only willing to pay for me to see a chiropractor to do acupuncture for my depression, and I go because at this point any possible help is help I guess...) but I just don't know what to do or why I'm putting this out there.

1934,EDPostRequests,1619196980,mwzr3q,"I know there’s a lot of these kinds of posts but here’s my story

it kinda started like around 2 years ago??
I suddenly became super self conscious about my weight and body and was constantly body checking, weighing and was being super mindful about what I was eating. I started exercising a lot (almost every day) and skipped breakfast + felt guilt in “wasted calories” for a few months and cut sugar out of my diet

however it was pretty tamed and these (disordered?) eating habits were more or less under control cause I had other priorities that outweighed it 

however I think it’s becoming something worse now. instead of skipping just breakfast, I started only eating about 1 meal a day + salad bowl and avoided my family during dinner time. I’ve noticed I started lying a lot to people about whether i’ve eaten and feel so much anxiety whenever the topic is brought up. most importantly, my brain has been in a constant fog and I literally have no way to concentrate cause it’s flooded with thoughts about food. what i’ve eaten, what i’m going to eat, when i’ll eat, basically calculating my days based on who’s going to see me eat/ how can I avoid the next meal. recently, i’ve tried going more than a full day of not eating any solids and my weight has dropped to a pretty low number. i’m constantly tired and my hair is dropping at a concerning rate, but the sense of pride outweighs the guilt from eating.  

as much as I want to loose weight, it’s not really about vanity???? idk how to explain but it’s more of I want to commit myself to something and the fact that the number on the scale is going down enough satisfies me. it makes me feel like i’m achieving something. but I can feel my body and brain screaming at each other and everyday fees like a constant battle.

I keep invalidating myself with: when I loose my period/ when I start fainting/ when my bmi hits - but there’s still a small rational voice in my brain pleading me, thus i’m here today

I lost a bit of weight when I was 15 by eating healthy and going running and sort of stayed in that range but I always had a bit of extra fat, especially stomach fat, thick thighs and some fat on my hips. I remember a physiotherapist pointing at my stomach and asking me, “and what’s going on there?”.

1938,EDPostRequests,1619196868,mwzpqe,"30M here. I’ve always had a turbulent relationship with food but was simply branded a picky eater as a child and never seemed to grow out of it. 

As a child my mother wouldn’t feed me anything if I didn’t eat what was on my plate. As I got older this has developed into what I call my “restaurant anxiety” where I refuse to go out to eat with people or do anything socially food related- like actively avoiding any activity that involves food in any way, like work Christmas dinners/nights out. Hell I’ve even bailed on social gatherings because I thought there *might* be a chance we’d go for food after. 

All because I have this notion in my head that it’s not okay to not like food and there’s something unacceptable about it. I’ve been conditioned to think that going hungry is a direct consequence of not liking what’s on my plate. 

On top of this, as soon as I begin to feel anxious about whether there will be food  I’ll be able to eat (I don’t even have to have food in front of me, I could literally be looking at a menu on my phone or something) then I lose my appetite completely and won’t eat for the rest of the day. And I mean I could be starving and I just choose not to eat? Because, again, that’s how I was conditioned. Not liking food = going hungry. 

Today this has resulted in my partner having to cancel our first date night since the beginning of the pandemic because I’m too anxious about the food on offer. It was literally a steakhouse and I love steak. But the thoughts of “but what *if* you don’t like it” started creeping into my head.

So for a couple of years now, maybe around 4 I have had issues with my body image. Also my appearance but in this I'll specifically talk about my body image. I've always been afraid of gaining weight because I already felt ugly. If I ever saw myself gaining a bit more weight than I'm used to, I would go through a period of eating less than I should to try and loose it. By that I mean maybe I wouldn't eat my dinner or sometimes I'd skip breakfast. At the start (and sometimes now but more often at the start) I used to bring food back up so that I didn't gain any weight. Right now, I have put on a bit of weight and I'm finding myself trying to eat less again. I'm obsessed with looking right.

Ive been underweight as long as I can remember. When I was around 3 years old, I was in the hospital for a week because I wouldn’t eat anything except milk. I do remember being really picky with foods and couldn’t get it down. but also had a low deficiency of some nutrient..maybe iron? Growing up I was ok with eating junk foods and fast foods but I would still be full with 1 meal a day with some small snacking.

I’ve always been skinny and thin, people would make comments about it and I felt if though I had to gain weight. In my culture/family everyone always talks about weight so honestly and open but in a negative way possible. But people don’t know you’re struggling! Ive always knew I had a problem and went to the scale all the time to see if I gained, even I knew I wasn’t eating enough but I couldn’t.

Anyway I am in my late 20s now and still obsessed with the scale. I would go on all the time to see how much I weigh. I have trouble gaining weight. I also have anxiety disorder and been to therapy but we never got to talking about eating habits before i stopped going. I have always skipped breakfast and have trouble keeping food down sometimes. I would literally gag like my body is rejecting food. I had an endoscopy because of this problem but physically nothing was found. I’m thinking it’s my anxiety and stress suppressing my appetite then.

I still have a habit and hard time of listening to my body’s hunger cues because I’ve always ignored them until I feel like I’m going to pass out. When I wake up sometimes I feel sick from not eating or forgetting to eat the night before. I don’t think if I’m purposely forgetting to eat or not but I really try to do it I just can’t get myself to. I sometimes eat 1-2 meals a day but just some snacks here and there. It’s been really hard to change ..my therapist did tell me maybe im feeling like I don’t deserve to eat and just making myself feel sick on purpose. I am also hard on myself that I can’t keep up with a workout and force myself to complete it even if I’m feeling so nauseous.

I (15f) have been only having 1 meal a day and I drink less hardly anything. I have been doing this for since around October/November (but here and there I didn’t just eat one meal a day)

I have MDD and ADHD. I have attempted suicide quite a few times and I’m on medication for both disorders.

I have never had a problem with the way I look, nor do I have one now. Occasionally I will look at myself in the mirror and be like ah man, I wish I didn’t have that much flab on my stomach, but I am in relatively good shape.

I don’t exercise pretty much at all, I don’t really eat that healthy, and I stay inside often. Like I said, I’m 15 years old, female, and I am a healthy weight for my age.

I do not purge, I do not binge, I do not hate my body, I just go through the day eating/drinking nothing until around 6-9pm.

The reason is, I have Invisalign, the clear teeth things that are alternatives to braces. You are supposed to have your Invisalign in for 22 hours a day. Whenever I take out my Invisalign, I usually forget to put them in for like hours at a time. This causes me to get behind in my trays (the retainer thingies), and prolongs the time of me getting straight teeth.

I don’t care about my teeth more than food, trust me... it’s just with my depression, I will constantly pick on myself for forgetting and then spiral into thoughts like how irresponsible I am and how I just waste my parents money. Also, not buying a lunch every day at school saves a ton of money. Yes we have food at home, but the longer it lasts, the better. Plus whenever I do take out my Invisalign, I usually eat one meal + some snacks.

My mom is kind of aware of this and she says “I don’t care about the money or the amount of hours your Invisalign are in, you need to eat”.

Anyways, since I’m newish to this, what do you think? Is this and ED?",Request: 15f Seeking advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/mwznbo/request_15f_seeking_advice/,1619218279,23-04-21 11:51

This is going to be all over the place, but the long story short is that I’ve had an eating disorder for about 17 years. I’ve never starved myself (eat tons of good food, but very healthy, which is admittedly a little disordered) but my purge is exercise. A lot of exercise, and it has always been this way. I won’t go into numbers, but I’m significantly underweight and do hours of exercise every day. It’s not high-impact like running or biking, but rather the whole Jillian Michaels’ “30 Day Shred” DVD three to four times a day and long walks when weather permits. Given my weight and the obsessive nature of my exercise (I also have OCD), I shouldn’t be doing anything - or maybe just an hour a day - but I feel like I can’t stop and fill any extra time with more activity even though I dread it every day.

I was in residential treatment out of state for five weeks at the end of 2019, gained a fair amount of weight by eating an INSANE amount of food and no movement, but came home due to insurance and lost the weight within five months. Now I have a job I love (work from home though, so more access to DVD workouts and walks) but still try and fit in all the exercise, which is stressful, and I can’t eff up this new job. My days revolve around it and I HATE it so much. No ED therapists in my area will see me because of my low weight (ironic, eh?) and I know I just have to cut it down to an hour or so a day, but I feel like I have no sense of what’s “normal” and how to fill those hours I fill with exercise. (Work is slow right now and contractually can’t do extra freelance work.)

So logically I know - cut it down, don’t cut down your food to compensate, gain the weight so your brain works better and you’re free from this hell - but doing it? Feels impossible. I told myself that today I’m cutting it in half - at least for today - but it already feels so wrong even though I know I need to gain quite a bit of weight to not look and feel like death.

I don’t know what I’m looking for here other than a reality check that it’s NOT normal to work out for hours a day - even if it’s not high-impact - and I need a sense of what other people do. How much do you exercise a day? A week? How do you find that balance? I’m mentally and physically just exhausted.

Hi everyone, usually I try to power through things like these alone, but I'm a bit at wits end. Over the course of the last year I've dieted down and build muscle to the point where I was easily in the best shape of my life. Bodyfat percentage was low and I had a really good physique in general. I was really happy with my diet and it was not restriction as much as just a general lifestyle change. Now since january I've lost myself a bit in this whole thing. After two or three days of decent overeating I went on another cut and dieted down to about xx - normal bmi range - (I'm 185cm). Since then I've started having the urge to cheat on my diet with highly palatable calorically dense food. At first the urges were weeks apart, but while I was on a break from Uni I've changed my daily routine. Before I wrote the bike to and from work (about 25min each) monday through friday and worked out every other day. During the break, I added bike rides on saturday and sunday and walked at least 10000 steps a day, which often blew up to about 25000. In hindsight I realize a problem with that behaviour, but back then I did not really see it. So the urges become stronger and appeared more often. When I had them, I literally could not stop eating at all. No matter how hard I tried I could not stop and consumed 6-8 thousand calories easily in a day. When I realized the context of the problem I dialed the fitness back to a normal amount again, but the hunger would not go. When I got it, it was bad, but would usually be gone after a day. The reason I'm writing this is that its wednesday today and it has not stopped since sunday. I've drastically overeaten four days in a row and I don't know if it'll stop. I'm so tired of food, but I can't stop eating. Does anyone have advice on what I should do? I think this might be hyperphagia as a result of going too low in bodyfat. I usually love my diet and I eat lower calorie high volume food, which satisfies me. 

Right now I am only craving high calorie food items. No matter how much I eat, I don't feel satisfied, even if I feel sick from it. No matter what I've tried the feeling won't go away. I'm exhausted mentally and physically. Would it be a good idea to see a doctor about this?

I would say right now is prob the healthiest I’ve ever looked tho. 

But still I look at my body and notice I have a couple parts where I have a little fat and even tho ppl say I look skinny I still consider myself overweight. So I’ve gone on another cut and I try to diet and I usually weight lift everyday and do some sort of cardio like tennis or hockey everyday. 

And whenever I look at food I can’t help but feel guilty and I hate myself when I eat so I’m prone to not eating for long periods of time and then eating a lot at certain points.

However, recently I have started to suspect that the vomiting might not entirely be a result of the pain, she had a new procedure done about a month ago which has helped reduce this pain and the vomiting still hasn't stopped.

She had a doctors appointment a while back and found that she'd gained a bit of weight, mainly due to being inside 24/7 (because of Covid rest) and not really excercizing much. She's been concerned about her weight and joked a few times that at least the vomiting from the pain will help her lose weight, I didn't think much of them at the time but now it's starting to feel like that might be the reason why she's still vomiting so much.

So, I guess I'm just after some advice and a safe place to vent.

I (32F) have had an eating disorder since I was 15. 2 years ago I relapsed hard. But I was proactive and sought out help pretty early once I realised how bad things were getting. My psychologist and dietician were amazing and I completed treatment November last year. And for the first time in over 15 years I felt fucking free. Like, truly.

This year I sought treatment for my ADHD as I could be on the meds now my eating was much better. Yay. And that really helped as well.

Long story short, I basically arranged everything in my relationship over the past 2 years and rarely had to rely on my partner as I had professional help. I had a huge exam in Feb (specialty exams for ICU), and after we spent Christmas away with his family away I went into hard core revision mode. 2 months was enough for my partner to completely guilt me and leave 2 weeks before my written exam because it was too much for him (translate: I wasn't arranging stuff for us to do and couldn't spend as much time with him). Obviously I have a lot of self worth issues and for some reason managed to let him convince me that I was being unreasonable expecting my partner to support me emotionally (translate: he was only really interested in the fun me). Then u had the oral exam and passed - yay. So yesterday he rocked up and I couldn't work out why he was being so nice to me and talking to me more.....until I saw the bite marks on his arm from a party he was at the night before.... Only they weren't bite marks, they were from a fence.... Then woops, they ARE bite marks but he wasn't lying he just ""forgot"" because he was that drunk. After half hour of him trying to convince me I was being unreasonable and ""crazy"" and ""jealous"" I came to my senses and kicked him the fuck out.

My issue is I now am going crazy? My cat died 6 weeks ago (he was chronically unwell and I cared for him deeply. I also wasn't allowed to talk about it with my partner), I had to give up my sport which was also my social life because of the exam, and all of my family are abroad. I'm trying to hard to make sure I'm doing all of my relapse prevention stuff. But I can't even look at food. I just...can't. I know I NEED to eat. I know I can't slip backwards. But I don't know ho to achieve this. I lost the person I was, and 2 months of that was enough for my partner to check out, then my cat died and I'm just a big black hole right now. I'd really appreciate advice from level headed people about how to juet make myself eat because my brain is not playing ball.

I have been dealing with an ED for the last 3 years, although its roots trace even before that. I like being as light as possible, and something that heavily bothers me is the feeling of bloated-ness / puffy-ness especially around the stomach area. 

Consuming sodium is especially a daunting task, as it is arguably the main cause of water retention.

Sodium and calories are not correlated, so one can never gain fat from sodium. However, if one were to consume a lot of it, it would show up on the scale as extra weight.

The reason as why to all the tasty are loaded with sodium is because our body tends to crave it because it needs it.

Personally, it's an uncomfortable feeling that I am hyperly aware of, but I can't keep living by it if I want to improve.

I'm aware that drinking more water helps the body flush out sodium, but it's difficult that means that you need to make yourself more bloated to be less bloated over the long term.

Are there any alternatives to counter this? Would eating more potassium relative to the amount of sodium flush it out evenly?

For the past six months, I have been feeling like I am on the *brink* of something potentially serious and scary.

I've been thinking about this stuff more lately after a recent breakup. There's the fact that being so distraught has affected my eating habits and amplified that second voice that truly doesn't give a fuck about how I look or feel. There's also the nagging thought that towards the end I might have become distant partially because of this stuff. We loved each other to pieces, and we shared a lot with each other, but I never told her about any of this.

If I tell people in my life, what can they even do that would help, enough to justify the burden of knowing? If I ever seek professional help, is there anything I should know?

I’m diagnosed with atypical AN, which basically (to me) acts as a reminder that I’m not skinny enough, haven’t lost enough weight (despite having lost 20% of my body weight in the past year), haven’t restricted enough to be considered what my brain perceives as ‘anorexic enough’. 

My dietitian told me that atypical AN (under OSFED) is easier to treat than AN itself since i’m not underweight enough to think in a deluded manner, and that at least some sort of logic about food would make sense to someone to atypical AN and it’s just about getting over the guilt. Honestly all that made me feel was that I still wasn’t sick enough physically despite feeling so sick mentally. I can’t tell what’s the difference between having AN while clinically underweight vs having AN while being of normal or above average weight. But I sat there about to tear up because I wanted to restrict myself even more.

When she did up my meal plan, I honestly felt two ways: 1) that sticking to the meal plan would make me gain weight since at this point of my daily eating I’m already barely using any weight at all, and 2) that i haven’t been restricting enough and not even with the right foods. The meal plan was typically stuff like eating soup noodles or a subway sandwich for lunch + a fruit, versus me eating half a plate of cream chicken pasta. Of course the meal plan’s meals were for lunch and dinner each, and I either usually only eat one of those meals or eat half (or less) of both and then not give into hunger cues. I guess it just feels pretty sucky to know that even when cutting my portions to like half a bread roll or half a serving of pasta, I’m not even restricting properly. 

I wonder why I was stupid enough to even decide to get help for restrictive eating at all when I’m literally still eating more food despite restricting. 

And exercise just seems daunting. Numerically speaking I’m slightly overweight and could lose x kg to fall into the normal BMI range, and I still have quite conditioned (though disappearing) muscles from having spent anywhere from 8–24 hours per week in technique classes and performance rehearsals for a good 4–6 years (lesser hours before that, but I’ve danced for more than 15 years). Now being depressed and needing the highest possible dose of Venlafaxine XR (activating) to even function at 15% of how I used to, physical activity is hard. Walking or standing for even less than 5 minutes feels like a marathon. I struggle to climb stairs at work (4 flights) despite having a good amount of muscle mass, and get so exhausted and sore (not just in my legs but my arms and upper back too) from climbing the first 7 steps of the first flight. And doing it because I have to. 

It just feels like such an impossible task when I barely find it in myself to have the energy and motivation to even get out of bed in the morning, or to do something simple like take a shower — it takes me 3–4 hours to get into the shower tbh. Having a really poor relationship with exercise from being forced to run at 6am in the morning on a school day as a young kid, and forced to dance while completely burnt out and suicidal, also adds to it.

I really wanted to lose weight anyway so I told myself when I either got to (x)lbs or started feeling shitty I would start eating more. When I started, I was at a healthy but slightly over weight. I’ve started paying a little too much attention to this. Now I’m choosing NOT to eat even when I feel like I should. This might be a red flag.

I think I’m having a good amount of body dysmorphia too because I still feel fat and do not feel good about myself. You can see my abs though. I’ve lost a few inches on my waist. Today I woke up feeling weak. Hard to move things and little energy. I made myself eat a very calorie dense and carb heavy meal because I don’t like that. I also have a big party tonight and will be drinking so the carbs are good for that.

What I’m coming here to ask, is...

why am I feeling so weak even after eating?

What can I do right now to make myself not feel weak ASAP. It’s scaring me and I never meant to affect my well-being.

How can I healthily manage this body dysmorphia and can you recommend some resources that were helpful for you? I want to feel comfortable going to the beach in a bikini. My body isn’t the problem anymore. It’s my head.

I have a bad feeling that I am spiraling in a negative direction and I want to put some work into myself before this turns into an actual ED.

If anyone is wondering, the Rx is Adderall.",Request: How can I healthily manage this body dysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/n2tm25/request_how_can_i_healthily_manage_this_body/,1619931240,01-05-21 17:54

Hello. Someone i care about might be developing an ED right now. I am definitely not an expert on the subject, so coming here makes sense. I am asking for their sake, since they're not so tech savvy. I should also mention that we live in different countries, so me being there isn't an option.

They just went through something traumatic, and as a result, they're having a hard time eating. They've described it as ""not being able to keep food in their mouth"". They start gagging when they try to eat food.

It's been 3 days without eating for them now, and they don't understand why they can't just keep the food down.

If its not too much to ask, what are some things i can tell them to try and help? I know that ""just eat it"" and stuff like that doesn't help.

Quick medical background: I have been suffering from various eating disorders since I was 12, from anorexia to bulimia with great weight fluctuations due to binges as a result. I was never clinically underweight at any point in my life but I finally sought treatment about two years ago and thanks to the care of the therapists and nutritionists at the clinic I've been recovering pretty well. I now have a normal healthy eating pattern (which is primarily vegan, but I do indulge in animal products sometimes) and quit alcohol and caffeine. I go to the gym every other day where I focus on muscle gain for strength, which my diet also reflects My weight however is currently still sitting in the overweight range because as we all know, with recovery usually comes weight gain even if you weren't underweight to begin with, and falling back into calorie restriction is a no go.

So today I went to see a cosmetic surgeon to ask for an opinion on my droopy eyelids. Instead this woman took it upon herself to question me on my eating pattern and weight. She literally had my file in front of her that displays my medical background and she still forced to weigh me (which already sent me into a panic attack) and despite protesting and asking her what this all has to do with my eyelids (she claims that being overweight causes droopy eyelids) she started questioning me on my diet. She made me tell her what I ate that day (a protein shake, some oatmeal and a banana for breakfast, 4 slices of bread with hummus and bell pepper for lunch) and she insisted that I was eating way too much and that I should not be eating any carbs at this weight. Mind you, I've done keto diets and they made me sick and only triggered starvation patterns but she wouldn't hear it, just talked right over me and I couldn't even begin to explain how wrong she was before she accused me of lying about my dieting history. In the end it turns out she was trying to sell me some overpriced protein diet that she makes a profit of... I left the place in tears since I never felt so humiliated before by anyone, let alone a doctor. She claimed that I couldn't have had an eating disorder and I'm probably eating way more than I was admitting otherwise I wouldn't be so fat (her words). She singlehandedly tried to undo years of therapy just to try and sell me some snake oil diet.

Anyway, I've already reported her to the medical board but I'm not sure if she will face any consequences for this. I just wanted to share this experience with others and ask if you ever had this happen to you before and if there were any repercussions for a doctor stepping out of line like this.",Request: Has a doctor ever dismissed your eating disorder?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/n2tk3q/request_has_a_doctor_ever_dismissed_your_eating/,1619931069,01-05-21 17:51

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I started being careful about my weight when my dad mentioned that I need to lose quite a bit. He said it as if I was going to turn into a monster and he was afraid of it. My sister was always so skinny, unusually so. When her clothes got handed down to me, it was always ""your sister looked skinnier than you."" ""I don't remember it being this tight of a fit"" ""Are you bigger than your sister already? At this age?"" That kinda pushed it. I've noticed it recently more so though. My portion would always be smaller because I would get tired of chewing or get tired of the flavour and just stop eating. My parents didn't wanna waste food I wasn't gonna eat so they gave me smaller portions and would just give me more if I wanted more. I never did, but they always made sure I knew there was more food. This then turned into me mistakingly 'training' myself to get full at the last or second to last bite, to the point where I'd want to throw up or sleep after forcing myself to finish the dish. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to xx kg in about a month, which isn't that bad. I was really happy and let go. I noticed this and would congratulate myself if I went a day without snacks or went to bed hungry. If I let go, I'd gain a few kg, and then I wouldn't be skinny. This cycle continued where I'd become a xx, let go, become a yy (only a fee kg heavier), and then force myself to become a xx again. I would regularly eat two meals a day if I was feeling good, but mostly just one because I honestly didn't feel hungry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, all of a sudden I would get a pain in my stomach accompanied by nausea from the days of not eating and then I'd eat a meal. I would put my wrist up into the air and turn it to see how far my wrist knuckle stood out from my actual arm to see how skinny I'd gotten. I'd often pull up my shirt to check how caved in my sides were and if they were less than what I wanted, I'd be mortified. I'd check my ribs to see if they stood out enough and check my thighs to see if my thigh gap is still there. I don't consider myself 'fat"", rather 'not pretty' enough for my parents or the beauty standard I want to fit into. My sister is in her early 30's and is xx kg, and my parents always bring her up as an example for how different we are in our eating habits. Tbh, they love her more than me bc she has all the pretty features.

1963,EDPostRequests,1619908979,n2teon,"Hey everyone, new here and I'm looking for help for a friend. I'm not very knowledgeable on eating disorders but I've done my best to not use any triggering language. I apologize if anything I say is insensitive, please let me know if it is. 

Last year I had a good friend (20 F) confide in me about her disordered eating. As far as I am aware I'm one of very few people that really knows the extent to which this effects her. 

I thought she was getting better with it but recently I've noticed a lot of concerning behaviours, in the way she talks about food and losing weight, some of her eating habits, cutting out certain foods, obsession with reaching a certain BMI, and in my opinion she obviously struggles with some degree of body dysmorphia based on how she talks about herself (she is convinced she is overweight when she is very much not and has lost a visibly significant amount of weight this past year). 

She has a background that she has told has contributed to her eating disorder in some ways. I know she started talking to a therapist about some past trauma but I don't know if she actually opened up about her struggles with food at all in relation to that. 

The reason I thought she was getting better was because she was seeing a therapist but she's gone through some very recent trauma and started to exhibit behaviours I personally find concerning. On top of the other things I recently noticed she is protective about going the washroom, and gets quite defensive if anyone else is around or too close when she is in there. I don't want to assume anything because I don't think she would do this but it does make me nervous that she is possibly, occasionally purging her meals.

I'm really at a loss here for how to connect with her. I don't think she is cognizant of her recent concerning behaviours, and doesn't see an issue with them or how they are contributing to her disordered eating. I'm scared she is going to get worse before she gets better, and I don't want to see her go through that because I know it will complicate so many other things in her life in the process. 

I'm really looking for advice on how to reach out and support her without pushing her away. I know I'm not a professional and I can't fix her mental health, but if there is anything I can do to help or prevent her from going down a very dangerous path I want to do it.

1966,EDPostRequests,1619861096,n2exdt,"Hello all,

Recently my partner and I noticed something that she's been doing for a while.

She has become increasingly worried about nutrition facts on the foods she eats every day. She is overly anxious about having too much sugar, or too much salt, or too much fat in one day and has been turning food away for fear that she might eat an unhealthy amount of any of those 3 main things, even if she hasn't had a significant amount already that day. She says she feels like she *must* check these nutrition labels at this point.

She is trying to gain weight because she's been underweight for most of her life and is sick of it but the stress of doing it as healthily as possible seems to be getting to her. We're not sure what to call it or how to Google for it. 


- For example, today she had avocado toast, a banana and coffee for breakfast. Then she had some protein oatmeal with fruit a bit later.

- For lunch she had some rice &amp; veggies with soy sauce, and had some Chex mix as well. 

- For dinner she had a breakfast-ish dinner with pancakes &amp; fruit on top. 

She almost did not eat the pancakes because she felt like she had too much sugar today already, which I found a bit.. stringent. 
She also turned down ramen, saying she felt like she had already had too much salt today.

Does anyone have any advice for dealing with this new habit?

I (19f) struggled with what I think was an eating disorder starting in eighth grade through high school. I restricted calories, was obsessed with looking at pro-ED posts, etc. I was never diagnosed but doctors and my parents were concerned when they noticed I was starting to have health issues such as fainting episodes.

I then gained a huge piece of my support system, my fianceé. I started to focus on recovery by having healthier eating habits, gaining weight, and reaching out when struggling. I was doing well for a while.

Recently, the negative thoughts have come back, and they're pretty strong. I've began to focus on my weight and look at pro-ED posts again, and I feel so guilty after eating. I talked to my fianceé, and she suggested therapy. I've been looking into it, and part of me wants to reach out so bad. But then I start to have all these negative thoughts about how I don't deserve help because I'm not at a low weight and I haven't started restricting calories again.

(currently) whenever i eat more than what i want, i cry and i eat more food, and i feel guiltier. rn it’s ramadan so it’s harder to count calories, i stopped counting them but i am still obsessed with calories and i weight myself whenever i can, i restarted my restriction even if it’s harder than before because as i stopped counting i ate more than my restriction. but it’s really hard to respect the restriction, bc i have a lot of cravings, parents that cook and eat with me, my extreme emotions, and ramadan rn. btw: i don’t exercise even if i want to, it takes to much effort and i have no motivation to me it’s not that bad, it’s hard to hold , but i like it somehow. some of my friends tell me i should worry and be careful because that’s bad and not normal.

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric  Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants  for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for  self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS.  tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that  delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes.  Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may  help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure  (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should  be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New  York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline  psychological assessment, questionnaires and six sessions of tDCS during  three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be  randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All  research procedures can be done from your own home–no in-person visits  are required.

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication  management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of  $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete  all research procedures.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to  declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional  Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

Hello everyone I don't really know where I'm at right now.

I don't think I have ever had a healthy relationship with food. When I was in my teens there was a very short period where I was binged and purged however that did not last very long. It got better and I was at my best when I started going to the gym. I was happy with my body and my mental health was at my best. I've not been underweight for at least 5 years.

But now with all the gyms closed I feel like I'm spiraling and I don't know whether I'm normal. I went over my personally set weight maximum 2 weeks ago and I feel like shit. I want to reduce my eating and start exercising but yesterday I binged and I feel so guilty. I did not purge. I don't know who to talk to. I have friends but I can't talk to them about this because I don't want to push my issues onto them and drag them into this mess. After all I'm technically normal weight. I feel like I'm chubby but a don't want to seem like I'm begging for attention.

Is this still normal behavior? Don't get me wrong I'm still very confident when I'm wearing clothes and still wear crop tops and tight clothing but I just dread stepping on the scale, taking my measurements or looking at myself naked.

I have been underweight my whole life up until now. Leaving my parents house and allowing myself to be freer with food soon got me to my goal weight. I am very short so that is low.

When I moved recently I could not bring my bathroom scale. I used to check myself weekly. Maybe out of curiosity, or maybe that is where the trouble started. Now I have no way to check my weight, and a new scale for such a frivolous thing is not in the budget.

I started noticing things I hated about my body more. I started picking at myself and cutting. I became aware of how my thighs touched when I stood normally. My behind felt heavy and offensive. I'm scared I am way over my goal weight. I went down to around a meal a day.

But I really cannot be. I can still see my heart beat through my chest, and after starving and drinking too much lately I can see my ribs again. I don't want to become malnourished, but I am so terrified of being seen as overweight.

Yes, I have some terrible upbringing and latent ideas, I think. Internalized fatphobia? I'm not sure. My mother was large and vocal about how much she hated it, and how little respect she gave anyone she saw as 'fat.'

recently ive been having on and off episodes of eating a lot, not really binge eating, since i eat less than what ive searched online that classifies as a binge. it happens every few days, for an example, id eat normally on one day, and the next, id be downing junk food and endless sweets into my mouth. this cycle repeats every two days, and i dont know how to stop it.

i always feel guilty after eating a lot, and my stomach hurts.

i still wanna lose weight, so i resort to not eating for the rest of the day when these episodes happen... im a healthy weight, what do i do? i really wanna make these stop. i know food isnt bad for me, im still growing, but i cant help ending up purging and overexercising.

I am a 22f recent college grad living with my roommate who is also my best friend. I struggled with anorexia for the past three years. I would say I am probably halfway to recovery (still underweight but see a therapist weekly, get weighed monthly, etc). I'm generally fine although still definitely struggling to get to a place where I can eat normally.

After Covid hit, my roommate lost a bit of weight but I generally attributed it to covid and us not drinking/binge eating after going out - more of her losing her freshman 15 than anything else. But over the past 2 months she's rapidly lost a lot of weight and her rhetoric around body image has changed - calling me 'healthy' despite the fact that my BMI is literally xx (underweight), calling other people 'healthy' who generally look too skinny. She has also called me curvy twice which hurt my feelings a lot even though I couldn't admit it. I'm really anxious/triggered by it but I mostly am just worried about her - I want to talk to her about it but I also remember that in the height of my ED when my friends would tell me I was too thin it almost boosted my confidence. One of our friends also told me that I need to speak to her about it and that she looks really scary.

Should I talk to her about it? I'm really anxious about it and it's getting hard to live in the same house as her but she was really helpful to me at the height of my ED and I want to support her too.

1995,EDPostRequests,1620553581,n8axr1,"Tl:dr - my gf is in successful ED recovery but still can get extremely triggered around people actively trying to lose weight. I am being encouraged to lose weight for an upcoming surgery and don’t know how to proceed and/or talk about this with her and need advice to understand how to healthily approach this goal.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been with my girlfriend for about a year, and I feel confident this is the girl I want to marry. She’s incredible, and our relationship goes beyond checking boxes. I never thought I could feel this way, love or be loved by someone. It rules!

&amp;#x200B;

Something I love about my gf is her incredible strength, resilience, and dedication to making her life fulfilling and mentally healthy. She had a pretty severe eating disorder (bulimia) from childhood into early college (we’re mid 20s now) that she describes as some of the darkest times of her life (and frankly, she’s been through a lot of dark stuff….so that’s saying something). She went through a formal recovery program and has been recovered/recovering for years. I can see in her behaviors that we take a lot of joy in food together, eat whatever we want, and practice talking about bodies unjudgmentally, etc. And she has talked with me several times about how proud she is of herself, and how much work it has been to get to this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s the problem: I have been overweight my entire life. I’ve never had an eating disorder, but certainly have some baseline shame around my body. More difficult for me though is the way doctors treat me. I have naturally high cholesterol, and have basically been told by doctors throughout my life that if I don’t lose weight I’m going to die. I think that is bad medical care on some level, but it does scare me, even though I try to make healthy choices. More pointedly, I have a major surgery coming up this fall. Often this surgery has a BMI requirement. My particular surgeon doesn’t abide by that, but it is pretty widely accepted that it’s better to lose as much weight as you can before surgery, and that complications dramatically decrease under a certain BMI. So….I’m interested in losing weight right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a difficult conversation with my gf last night that feels like my fault. I just don’t know how to talk about weight, calories, etc in a way that wasn’t triggering to her. She flat out told me that she can’t be around people who she knows is counting calories, because she cannot risk her recovery by being triggered like that. I totally understand! But now I don’t know what to do. I think I can still try going to the gym on my own (I enjoy weightlifting), and just making as many healthy choices as I can, listening to my body, etc without calorie counting. Even though using something like MyFitnessPal would arguably be a LOT easier for me…I understand where my gf is coming from and don’t want to risk her health or our relationship over something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

But more generally, I just don’t know how to talk about these things at all. She cried last night I think because my language was just triggering to her (I used phrases like “calories in calories out” to lose weight). I felt terrible. I don’t know how to proceed, and she suggested I do some research on how people in ED recovery think about this stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

So I’m trying any avenue I can. If anybody has advice, from a recovery perspective, on how I can navigate this, please let me know. Even if there's just a standard rule book for people IN recovery, so I can learn what the do's and don'ts are might help. I also realize that I may just never be able to pursue weight loss as a stated goal if I want to be with her. I’ll have to make my peace with that, and I have a therapist who could help me, but I just don’t know what makes sense here.

1996,EDPostRequests,1620381765,n6v0do,"Made this anonymously so no connection can be made to my persona.

So, to begin with, I (M, 22) met a woman (23) through a mutual best friend.
She told me even before our first date that she went to recovery for her eating disorder some years ago, but that she felt it coming back. I didn't knew a thing about eating disorders back then (two months ago). I thought everything is fine. On the first date we just walked for two hours at a river where she works. We get along quite well and went on a second date two weeks later, watching some movies and series at her home. We drop innuendos back and forth, from talking about future holidays we'd like to spend and talking about marriage (though it was for fun, but I knew it was amusing).
We texted back and forth and since our first date. There was never a day where we wouldn't text eachother, always beginning the day with ""good morning"" and ending it with ""good night, sleep well"".
She has sometimes told me about her visiting a therapist, but around two weeks ago she said things don't get better.
We wanted to meet again, but after some time she seemed hesitant, saying ""we don't have yet anything to do"" even though we previously talked about what we like to do.
At that time i was continuing writing/sending voice mesages, as we usually do. Days went by without pause.
Then her therapist recommended her to not be alone on weekends, so she went to a close friend and work colleague of hers that helped her during troubling times.
I told her ""I don't want to pressure you or put you on the spotlight, I just feel like I'm in a sort of limbo with you. Hope you understand""
Then she sent a text about what food they will order and that they wanna drink something alcoholic. She followed that with a misunderstanding ""You probably shouldn't put the spotlight on me. And i will write less this weekend as I want to enjoy the weekend without distractions""
Two days we continued as before, until she didn't initiate contact anymore. She was the last to write me, but she didn't leave any room for me to respond to. Three days later she texts me a simple Hey with her favorite emoji, the one with the red cheeks. After some texts she sent a voice message, tellling me things got worse and an ultimatum was put so she doesn't have to go to the hospital and she regains her weight. She said she was silghtly underweight. The deadline was set to end of May. I know she doesn't want help, as I can't really fundamentally help her. And she doesn't want me to involve there. But more than often I tell her that if there is anything she wants to talk about she can talk to me. She has already entrusted me with informations she said she didn't tell anybody, it has to do with past traumas. She never did tell anybody because she was judged by everybody and nobody believed her in the city where she moved away from.

I told her it's good to hear from her from time to time, as it was also unusual for me when we went from an everyday good morning/good night to nothing, it's quite a contrast. I always think I did something wrong, browsing for hours on reddit and google to scientific researches about eating disorders and trying to learn everything about them so I know not what to do. Even suppressing my own duties just to know the answer.
She said she tries to keep contact every then and there, ""but it's not that easy"" she said.

Some days after I sent her some voice messages, I said I don't want to annoy her (because I didn't get a definite answer that I know what is happening, though I might be dumb), but I told her I did some research (Didn't tell her that I did that almost everyday for two weeks straight).
The more I researched about the topic the more I appreciate her for being so upfront about it from the beginning, as it's not that easy, how would I know that.

She was in bad mood and some other things and didn't respond to me for two days. She said she doesn't find it bad that I informed myself, but she said ""I feel like everybody I know wants to make my problem theirs. I feel like it's a burden""

Disclaimer: I know sometimes I'm a little insecure, a past relationship still has a mark on me. But it's gotten better. 90% of the time I'm confident. It may also seem like I'm a little too much into her, but I know for a fact that she was or is also a little into into me.

Here's some things that remind me that she knows I'm worth: when our conversations were flowing I often tried to be fun, and she wrote me after some ""No joke, you made me laugh like nobody ever did before"". I proposed her the idea of going dancing together in classical fashion, and when she was still talking about me to our best friend she said that I made her very lucky.

So that concludes my/our situation. The question that doesn't leave my head is if it's okay if I just wait until she responds when she is okay with it?
The last week I stressed myself about what I might have did, or if not, if it's something that she can't do right now in her state.

With my still limited knowledge about eating disorders I wanted to ask you wether you had experiences with such situations. The most I read about on reddit never really stated dating/being in a relationship is exclusive to eating disorders. I ask you specifically as I know she would dodge the question and feel burdened, and I want to avoid that.

CW: Eating restrictions. Hello all- reaching out in a bit of panic. I just got Invisalign this morning, and I’ve been [mostly] in recovery for my ED almost two years. I have no earthly idea why it didn’t occur to me that the Invisalign requirements could be problematic, but here we are. I need to keep my trays in for 22 out of 24 hours a day. The ortho suggested I *set a timer* when I take them out to eat. Timing my meals doesn’t sound at all concerning!
Also, one of my recovery strategies has been eating many small meals throughout the day, which also seems to make my metabolism happy. That won’t be possible now- it takes at least 10 additional minutes to get the trays on and off my teeth each time and to clean them thoroughly. I’ll probably sit down for two larger meals, which I’m worried may trigger purging? Idk. 
I’m just so, so worried that these parameters are going to trigger the type of obsessive restrictions or purging that were my problem before. At no point did my dentist or ortho suggest that ED recovery might be a consideration, of course.
Has anyone dealt with this? Any tips? I’m too far in the process or the finances to back out now. I’m also not currently seeing a therapist because of the pandemic, and I won’t be able to afford adding one due to the Invisalign costs.

How do I end a restrictive cycle when I don't have control over my own food? For some context, through the beginning of this year I had been on a really good recovery streak. However, in the past week I have had to go into quarantine due to an international move and I don't have any control over the food I am eating. This has caused me to relapse really harshly and I don't know what to do. There is so much food, two three course meals daily, and extras and I feel incredibly guilty for not having any. Every time I think about eating it or even go near it I feel nauseous. I'm not intentionally restricting, I desperately want to eat but I don't know how to make myself do it. I have no option to cook my own food or even choose what meals will be made, which is another major factor as that level of control is how I improved in the past. Does anyone have suggestions?

Question: I used to have bad ADHD as a child. I still have it, just not as bad as when I was younger. With that, I was prescribed Adderall. One of the side affects was that it suppressed appetite, but I didn’t really care much. I didn’t care, that is, up until I stopped taking it about a year ago because I felt like I didn’t need it anymore. Then, I started gaining weight because I was eating more. I’ve started to hate the way I look and so I started taking it again, not for the focus aspect but for its side affect of an appetite suppressant. Would that be considered as some form of an ED?

2007,EDPostRequests,1621386743,nfrvhk,"Hi.
I (53F) have struggled with various eating disorders from the time I was about eight years old. It's mostly been BED, with periods of severe restriction especially in my 20s and 30s. I finally sought help at the end of 2019 and spent four months in an intensive outpatient program at a highly-regarded eating disorders clinic. It helped tremendously, especially with ""fat acceptance"". Some of the best lessons I learned were that food is just fuel, there are no ""bad"" foods, and ""fat"" is just an adjective. When I left the program, I had tools under my belt and a new outlook.
And then the pandemic hit. Along with the isolation and the toxic positivity that is thrown at essential workers (I am one) and some severe mental health struggles my kid was having that were leading to rages and abuse, the binges came back -- not quite full-bore, but close.
I have been excusing my binges by comparing them to worse binges I've had in the past. I keep hanging on to ""fat acceptance"" and the fact that I am the fat girl who baffles doctors with her perfect blood pressure and perfect cholesterol and perfect A1C. Thing is, it's gotten to the point where my weight is affecting my health now. I am at the highest weight I have ever been in my life. My feet and lower back hurt all. the. time. My stomach is starting to get in the way of sex. I took my dog out for a walk yesterday and it took 20 minutes to walk less than half a mile. Five years ago, I was walking 20-30 miles a week.
I spent so many years hating my body. Treatment got me to love my body again. Now I am having a hard time reconciling the fact that I need to take action to be kind to my body against the old tapes that are telling me that any sort of modification, tracking, or restriction of food intake means that I hate my body.

My younger sister is in the midst of a particularly low point with her anorexia. It's rather intense. I have never had an ED, or been close... on the contrary, food is my best friend, always has been... my family and I are doing everything we can to wrap our heads around it (any advice here would be great as well). She has been opening up to me about her thoughts during my visit home to see her, expressing to me that her ""ED thoughts"" are particularly strong right now - specifically that food will harm her, make her fat, make her stomach hurt, and that getting through this is so much arduous work and she is not convinced that she even deserves that kind of attention and care from herself. It is body image, self-worth, and seemingly most prominently, the stomach pain (tips on navigating this are beyond welcome too). She has been in and out of treatment centers, but she has moved around from place to place, even signing herself out at the last one, never completing a program for a multitude of reasons: the food tastes bad (food always tastes bad to her, but extra bad in the facilities) and you don't get to pick what you eat, her therapists are not present enough to actually talk about things and do actual work (they just force her to eat and sleep, that's it), she doesn't get to go outside, etc. Honestly, sounds awful to me too. I mean, isn't a large part of ED the issue of mentally linking food, or lack thereof, with punishment? Does this approach of taking away privileges and human rights to breathing fresh air not simply reinforce this way of perceiving food? Genuinely, I want to understand if this works for people - if she is simply resisting inpatient because her ED is in the drivers seat, or if these concerns are valid and shared by many who have gone to inpatient, or perhaps a bit of both.

Now she is in this tough spot. She is at my parents place where my parents are the ones figuratively wrestling with her to complete her meals, which seem to be one of three things: a shake of ensure mixed with peanut butter and ice cream, 5 or 6 yogurt covered pretzels, or a slice of bread. She freezes and I can see her panic on her face when she is served food. As you may have deduced, she is slowly losing weight after the weight she sustained from 6 or so months on a feeding tube. She is at the point where if she went to an outpatient/partial program, they would likely strongly suggest inpatient or drop her from the program for liability reasons. Same with therapists... she is meeting with one tomorrow who may be more open to the possibility of taking her on than others. She needs real, intensive help, more than what our (incredibly giving and self sacrificing) parents are capable of but she is just so incredibly resistant and non-responsive to the kind of care they offer at inpatient! Where do we go from here? Is it unsafe for her to be here at home? ...will she be ok? And what can I do, as her sister? It's incredibly hard to watch someone you care about so much become so pinned by their own mind... listless and numb and rigid with fear of life. She is really in the thick of it, folks.

She's 18 now and has been ""starving"" herself since she was 14, she started being bulimic (don't know if that is the correct way to express it) about 1.5 years ago. I've been trying to help for about 2 years now, but it all seems worthless as she tells me what I'm doing is useless and that she doesn't want to be helped. I have been trying to get her help, be it as trying to ""make"" her talk about her ed with her parents, but she tells me that they think that she just has to eat more and she won't be mentally ill anymore. She doesn't want to go to a psychologist because she thinks that he/she isn't going to help her and just make her situation worse. She says that she should be in a psych ward (don't know if it's the right term) but at the same time doesn't want anything to do with it.

2017,EDPostRequests,1621080388,ncxe0i,"Hey everyone! I'm 21 year old female. As the title says I'm totally lost and torn between mental disorders such as depression, anorexia, bulimia anxiety, BPD and everyday life problems such as quitting smoking and stopping antidepressants as my therapist recommended...
I've developed first signs of anorexia 9 years ago, I was quite chubby kid and my mum was always obsessed with all of us looking all nice and fit, she wanted me to look nice and dresss nice and feel nice and being fat was restraining me from that ""happpines"". Anyway I'm not sure if I should mention numbers here but as an anorexic I went from chubby to really skinny in short time frame. Smoking cigarettes helped with that a lot. Everytime I was hungry I would just smoke a cigarette or two and suddenly I'm full. After 4 years of anorexia I started working a part time student job in a restaurant and vecause of my bad relationship with food it didn't take long for me to develop bulimia. I gained about 15 kgs in 2 months and was finally looking healthy, started getting compliments on my looks etc, little did they know I was just digging myself deeper pit. I would eat enormous amounts of really unhealthy food and as easy as it sounds I would just visit toilet a little too often. No matter how hungry or full I am, food couldn't and mustn't stay inside me at no cost. 
It was all tolerant until my health started to rapidly worsen, I lost all my energy, shortness of breath, sleeping problems, very slow digestion, hair loss, teeth started to rot...
2 years ago I finally decided to get help and work it out, unfortunately, no luck. I tried 4 therapists and non had any interest in my problem, I would wait all month for my next appointment and they would just ""be over with me"" after 10 minutes. I tried 6 different antidepressants and 4 anxiolytics and non had any use. They would just make me feel numb and careless about purging, maybe even killed my motivation a bit. After I realized no one will help me, things got a bit better and bulimia was still present and I would still binge amd purge few times a week, but I at least I ate normal amount of food through the day while still smoking a pack a day. 
Anway, 2 days ago I decided to quit smoking, and 3 days ago my therapist decided I should quit my antidepressants because of mood swings so she sees what we're dealing with beneath all that. The problem is, my next appointment is in two weeks and I feel so depressed, miserable and fat. Instead of smoking I just binge random snacks such as chips or fries, chocolate, tons of candy and gums... I am so bloated, for sure gained some weight and I feel like my bulimia has worsen a lot because of this. I feel awful and fat and I can't stand it but at the same time, as hard as it is, I don't think smoking would help me either... Maybe short term, but I know as soon as I finish that cigarette I'm gonna regret it. Sorry for a long rant, I just don't know what to do and who to talk to. All my friends are smokers so I know they'll be biased.
My final exams are getting really close and I'm scared and anxious because I can't focus one bit and occupy my time with ton of part time jobs just so I don't have to be with myself. I dont even know what's the point of this post, I just need some optimism and maybe your experience with similar problems. Is now even the right time to stop smoking?

2019,EDPostRequests,1620984688,nc4jpp,"Like many of you, my eating disorder started out as a diet, that rapidly spiraled out of control. My journey began in January 2021, when I first began restricting. Over the course of the past 5 months, I have lost a significant amount of weight, in a relatively short period of time. I lost the most weight in that first month. In late February, I became horribly suicidal virtually overnight. I have struggled with depression most my life, but this was extremely rapid and uncalled for. I made the connection that it must've been related to hormones, as I was supposed to start my period in a few days. I have never struggled with my emotions around my period before, so I found it very odd. However, I had discontinued birth control back in December, so I thought maybe it had something to do with this, and my hormones were still leveling out.  Although it was still strange, considering I had two normal/healthy periods in December and in January. Because I had lost so much weight so fast, I never ended up actually bleeding in February, but experienced all the period symptoms (cramps, bloating, etc.) A little over a month later in March, I yet again experienced horrible thoughts of suicide in the few days before and after my period. Same thing happened in April, although these times mensuration actually occurred. I spoke to my therapist who told me it sounded like PMS or PMDD. Although it can randomly develop, the only common denominator we could think of at the time was me having gone off the pill. We figured maybe I've had it all along, but it was well managed by the pill. So I went back to the OBGYN and back on the pill. Unfortunately that only exasperated matters, and I nearly had to be hospitalized because of it. That experience left me questioning what I had originally thought. Maybe going off birth control had nothing to do with my sudden onset of PMDD, maybe it was my restrictive eating habits? Or a combination of both made the perfect storm? I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? I have to admit, I was very reluctant to beginning my path to recovery until the PMDD became debilitating. I'm pretty convinced they are connected, and am praying that if I can get back to a healthy, nourishing, well-balanced diet and exercise program that I will be able to reverse whatever hormonal damage I have inflicted upon myself, and have my period without nearly having to be put on suicide watch.

I’m 21 F, and I’m not sure if this is the place to post. I don’t count calories excessively, I don’t vomit, but a year ago I was a healthy weight with the goal of wanting to lose some. And I’ve had a really stressful time at uni this year and it’s made me just stop eating. I knew I have lost lots of weight (I think it still be in the healthy weight category just about) and I feel great in my body, but my house mate commented the other day on how I don’t seem to eat anything and I decided to add up everything I’ve eaten in the past few days and it’s barely anything. Not sure if I am allowed to put numbers of calories in here.

I am hungry a lot of the time but I honestly just don’t notice it. It’s something I’ve recognised before but I decided it made me feel better because I don’t have any bloating from food and I feel like I’m accomplishing something. I’ve just started seeing someone and I don’t want to be conscious of my belly around her when she sees me, and I just feel better in myself in general so I just forget about being hungry. I had some fitness goals but I haven’t exercised in a long time because I’ve been so busy with uni work. So I don’t feel weak or tired from the not eating, but I don’t feel strong anymore (I had some muscle from when I did Muay Thai for 5 years but now I feel physically weak muscle wise) and I want to change that.

Basically, I read this story about someone who was in a calorie deficit for a long time and when they tried to gain muscle they found they had to gain weight because they had “ruined” their metabolism, and it made me so scared because I’d never thought about it before but clearly I’ve been in a massive calorie deficit for so long I feel like if I start eating “normal” I’m going to gain weight and I really don’t want to. I feel good about my body for the first time but I also feel so unhealthy. Am I encouraging an unhealthy relationship with food in myself? How do I fix it without gaining back all the weight I’ve lost?

I follow lots of fitspo accounts in the hopes I’ll be motivated to be fit and they all say that you should eat well, but ALSO you have to be in a calorie deficit to lose weight. But I feel like I’ve taken that to the extreme, especially since I don’t have any time to work out (exam season). I spend an embarrassing amount of time looking at my body in the mirror because I’ve never been so thin and I’m terrified of losing it.",Request: Seeking advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/nlx545/request_seeking_advice/,1622102660,26-05-21 21:04

2025,EDPostRequests,1622020297,nlcia3,"I’m 3 years recovered from my ED, and while I have a relatively okay relationship with food now, I still find food description words extremely uncomfortable to say or hear. I feel physically sick when I hear people use words like ‘delicious’ or ‘tasty’. Even typing them makes me feel uncomfortable, and I haven’t said them verbally in probably 10 years. On top of that, I also have an extreme fear of saying the names of certain foods, as well as hearing other people use them. This hasn’t been a huge problem in the past, but now that I’ve voiced to my friends and family what my trigger words are in an attempt to make them understand that they still have to be mindful even though I’m recovered, they feel the need to say them over and over ‘as a joke’ because i end up getting sick and having to excuse myself. I guess it’s just funny to them. I am fully aware that my triggers aren’t anyone else’s problem, but there’s a difference between them being able to speak freely about food around me, and saying trigger words over and over to make me uncomfortable. However, with that being said, I’d much rather get over the triggers than have to argue with my friends and family over respecting the fact that doing this is uncomfortable for me. Uncomfortable is also an understatement but I don’t know what other word use to describe the feeling. 

So, is this a problem that anyone else has ? And if it is, how do you get over/cope with it ?

I saw a my reflection which made me do this. I felt I ate too much this morning

I DONT EVEN KNOW MY FUCKING WEIGHT that’s the asinine nature of it all too

Because I’m in a motor chair and can’t stand I need a special device to be weighed and good luck finding one in state with this shit infrastructure and healthcare (USA)

I can’t tell my partner bc she makes dumb fucking comments about me being hot in response to this. Or that I simply shouldn’t entrain those thoughts

I need to not tell her or my only friend because I just need to have my shit together and I simply don’t

My other friend has an ED and I don’t want to bother him because I wasn’t the best support for him. I know that now all too late. I realized today that a year ago how he brought it up once and I made a “ you need to aim for a healthy weight “ comment. I know I meant well I just.....I wish I could apologize He’s never brought it up since

For context. He said he was happy he reached —lbs (which was very underweight . )He said he knew he shouldn’t have been but wanted to share

He’s not proana. I just wish I said something better. That wouldn’t trigger or enable but show support

I can check the search to see how best to apologize to him

I wonder If bringing up the situation to apologize for would end up triggering him...

Reading that line just made me want to self harm my hips lol

I don’t know if I have an ED or not I really don’t want one

I don’t know if I’m pretending it’s okay or if I’m just on some dicey line and there’s time to get out

I know though. I know I have something wrong and I don’t know how to fix it. 5 years ago I self harmed over drinking too much soda and 2 years ago I went a week eating nothing but sunflower seeds and freaking out over their calorie count

I did ask my friend a year ago because I noticed I had issue with eating . And he recommended to force eat something you really really like. And I tried that a number of times with no luck

Because of the anxiety I have around eating I just try to avoid thinking about or I lose appetite. I’ve tried exercising and did it to the point of using it as a method of self harm

I’ve tried dieting and did it to the point of eating nothing but seeds until I passed out

I can’t even ignore it because now I’m going to have to avoid every thought about my body or I’m going to lose my shit because I’m that fucking incompetent

I hardly eat. And when I do it’s sugar and carbs and I’m stressed it’s sugar and carbs and I’m always fucking stressed

Hi, so I have always had this problem with eating, always a super skinny dude. There were days especially in pandemic when I was supper depressed and couldn't eat at all for an entire day. What helped me tremendously was looking at my photos. I have realized how ugly I look, how childish and weak as an adult my appearance is and decided to change it once for all. My strategies:

* Creating google sheets excel file, and counting all calories. If you don't count them you will under or overestimate them. It's in human nature and was proved by studies. Once scientists realized that people that try to lose weight underestimate their intake by a lot. Same probably applies to people that try to gain weight. Oh and remember, what really matters is an average of intake over a long period of time, not just what you have on a single day. Body mass changes take time and you need to be patient.
* High kcal shakes, for example oatmeals, whey mass, banana, milk, penaut butter. Fat's are your friend, a lot of kcal with little hustle.
* Take photos, celebrate small changes ask someone to eat meals with you. We are social animals, it's a lot harder for us to skip something when other person is doing the same thing.",Request: These are my strategies for fighting my eating disorder.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/nqsy8l/request_these_are_my_strategies_for_fighting_my/,1622680856,02-06-21 13:40

I’m not scared to eat, it’s just that the thought of eating food makes me so nauseous that I can’t do it. I only eat at dinner time when I’m so hungry that I can actually eat without nausea. 

Right around quarantine I gained weight like never before and got stretch marks from the weight gain. I’ve been more concerned with my weight this year then ever before, I constantly feel fat and I was swinging in and out of diets and exercising routines from July2020 to March2021. The nausea issue is new, I just... can’t eat. I can’t even sleep now because I’m not eating. I can only sleep after I’ve been awake for ~36 hours.

The part that is freaking me out the most is that I weigh myself several times a day since the nausea issue and I often find myself happy with the weight it caused me to lose. Sometimes if it makes me feel really good about myself I’ll skimp on the one meal a day that I can actually stomach. 

About 3 months ago, I was on my most restrictive diet with calorie counting. I knew it was on the low side, but I thought I couldn’t meet my weight goal unless I did it. Sometimes I found myself wishing I had the willpower to suffer through an Ed for a couple months to lose the weight. I stopped the dieting and exercising in since the end of March because I was worried it was becoming obsessive. But I know I did not will myself into the nausea issue, it just started happening and it hasn’t gone away.

Hello ! 

I barely eat, have seen a doctor but didn't get news after only a blood test since 3 weeks now... What should I do next ? I'm really lost...
Should I go take a new appointements ? (Each visit at the clinic, we get a new random doc anyway)
I dont want to bother... And I'm affraid it will be all the same and I would get no news or they say I have nothing....


Long post for more info

So since 4 or 5 months I barely eat even one full meal a day. I've lost my appetite, but I still feel hungry to the point my stomach hurt and I double over waiting for it to pass...

The question of if I'm hungry is hard for me to answer... I have DPDR so I feel very detached from my body while still being in it, so I say that my stomach feel hungry as it hurt me... But there is no more food that I want/make me feel hungry. Maybe raspberry ! They are still very yummy to me... But mostly everything else ""disgust"" me, while it is food that I like !! I really don't understand...
My psychiatrist suggested me ARFID, and it made me realise that it's something I've always had but was hard to describe so I have just tagged as Picky Eater... But still my whole life my ARFID was manageable, now it's just out of control !!!! And I did loose my appetite as I miss meal without feeling hungry, and when I do feel hungry it's too late now ._. food became hard to take
But then, genius I am, I tried to eat even if I wasnt feeling hungry!... It don't work much, I do it still, ofcourse I try to eat... But I'm just putting food in the trash at the end because it dont want to pass my lips and if I do force it, and start to masticate and taste and then... I slow down and I'm not able to swallow. Like, I tried to swallow. And it give my throat the reflex to puke, so it's really hard to force, so like yeah I could force myself everytime I eat... What a life it would be 😞

when it all started, I was still feeling hungry for real, it started with only some food that would not want to pass my lips or just thinking about it maked me sick (but it was still food that I normally liked a lot!) And it seemed to change day to day for some food, like one day I couldnt swallow cucumber or chicken, but the next day ? No problem.
And I didnt look much into it at first
But then it became problematic, because the only food that I was able to swallow was pancake with chocolate ... Only that
For lunch
For diner
Everyday
Oh it was very delicious ! And I eated as much to be satisfied, would you say that it's healthy or normal for a human being to survive only on pancake of chocolate and nothing else ? 
At the end, it maked me sick too. It wasn't surprising, eating so much of one thing can only make sick.

And now it's more hard then ever to find something that I will be able to eat and swallow...

😞 I talk with my psychiatrist once a month, so ofcourse each month since it started I tell her "" I'm hungry, but I'm not able to eat, what should I do ?"" And each time becoming more distressfull ! But all she can do is tell me to go see a doctor... And I finally did see a doctor at a clinic ! And he touched my neck, said to lay down, touched my belly, asked if it hurted, said many mh, said well we gonna do a blood test, also look if you might be pregnant.... (Mind you, I have still my periods without a change, have a contraception aaaand... After 5 months wouldnt I know if I was pregnant ?!)


But that was 4 week ago now... The test was done and they still didn't call me back...
Look, I know I was already enduring the starvation since 5 months, and testing blood take time I know..... But still ?? Some news?? Some checkup?? Atleast he could have gived me some advice on how to take care of my body, what I could try to eat 😞 That's what I think...

I really feel bad to take another appointment and bother them again with my problem...

I've struggled with disordered eating my entire life, as a result of my parents who shamed my sister for gaining weight in college and her expressing disordered thoughts to me--when I got to high school I also got comments that I was gaining weight from my parents, and it really started to spiral in me (I'd skip meals, look at myself and identify the areas of myself I didn't like). Flash forward to 4 months ago, my first college semester on-campus and I would skip some meals, overeat others, and constantly feel bad about my body. The guy I dated briefly then did make a lot of comments to me when I would bring up my weight insecurities: ""you know, the only way to be skinny is to eat less"" ""come work out with me"" ""what do you expect when you're eating all that junk at the dining hall""...yeah that combined with ""you're so fat you've gained so much weight"" when my parents visited me mid-semester kind of put the nail in the coffin. 

I'm an average weight, on the lower side. But I can't help thinking I need to lose weight. I need to. Even if I don't think fat is a bad thing. Even if I see fat people as just as worth life and food as skinny people. And because it's only been a few months of actual restriction/binge cycles, my brain tells me I don't need help since I'm not actually diagnosed and not deathly skinny to the point where I need hospitalization. But at the same time, I'm miserable, I can't not calorie count, I eat half of the minimum calorie intake people should have most of the time, I'm obsessed with body-checking, weighing myself, and crying in the mirror. I don't know what to do, but I'm scared to eat, I'm scared to gain the weight that I've already lost. I simultaneously want to like food but I also need to get worse. 

I'm so afraid that it's too late, I can't just start eating again. I don't even know if it's an actual ED since it hasn't been that long. I'm losing faith in food so, so quickly and today my mother weighed herself on the scale, said her weight (lower than mine), and then proceeded to call herself fat. I had just eaten more than I usually do, and I almost had a breakdown over it. My mom saying that just made me spiral, and I'm thinking of going to extremes tomorrow to lose the weight I gained.

Mostly concerned about the professionals I see telling family. 

POST: 
I'm a male, turning 25, in Australia. (If that info helps.)

Hey guys and girls, never thought I'd be in a place like this.

I started my behaviours around 2 years ago, but they became really extreme around last year, limiting calories by a substantial amount, then to purging when I felt I went a little (what I deem ""suitable""/safe, ""safe"" as in not to rupture or damage my throat) over that amount, I have purged large amounts, but I have to do it in secret and the longer I'm gone from my usual places the more questions are asked. So I only purge when I'm a little over my lowly calorie limit, when I binge a lot of food, I just leave it and become very agitated and filled with guilt. 

So last year I began purging, at first it was once or twice a week, then at one stage it was once a day for a fortnight. Then it ""died"" down to once or twice a month from then on. I thought I could keep it around that number. Until last month... I started doing it almost every day again, I did it everyday for a fortnight then it's ""died"" down to 4-5 times a week now. 

I want to tell the professionals I see, to see if they can help, but I don't want them to tell my family, I live with my family and I'm turning 25 this year. I'm just asking here if anyone has input in whether they'll tell my family, or just general advice? It's gotten quite extreme, the purging and the calorie limit (I admit, the calorie limit has improved very slightly, I let myself eat like 20% more calories now compared to last month.) 

I honestly thought I could control this, but it's getting more uncontrollable than I could imagine. I'm slightly overweight, so they might not treat it as serious, that's what I'm thinking any ways. 

The purging made me feel like a living being, but then quickly dulled in that sensation, I'm ""on-paper"" diagnosed  with schizophrenia, which isn't doing very well for me, mostly long term negative symptoms are kicking my ass.

For the last 8 months or so I've been struggling with an eating disorder. It started out as bulimia, but futher into the new year things only got worse and I eventually ended up losing A LOT of weight in a very short period of time.
Eventually my mum started to get on my ass about it. As well aware of my isssues I am, I continue to live in constant denial. I don't know why- I just can't bring myself to admit to anyone that maybe I'm not doing to great. I always end up dismissing it, or getting irritated.
Anyhow- my mum, obviously caring about me booked me in for a check-up with my GP. This is were things get a bit messy. I don't know what possessed me to make such a dumb decision but it happened nonetheless. Without going into how I actually did this- prior to my appointment I managed to attached x kgs worth of weights to myself. Looking back on it now I'm kicking myself... but it gets worse. Upon weighing me with the weights, it showed that I was on the smaller side or whatever but nothing of concern- I was thinking great I got away with it blah blah blah.

2066,EDPostRequests,1622367102,no7lve,"I don’t know what kind of advice to ask for here, but I need to know I’m not alone. I’ve dealt with some disordered eating habits for a few years now, specifically food avoidance and starvation related stuff. I typically have a good grip on these issues any given day as long as I don’t have to face potential triggers. Welp, about seven months ago I got Covid and lost my sense of smell and taste. That was fine for the most part; I had to battle a lack of appetite (it’s a lot easier to not eat when eating isn’t enjoyable), but after maybe three weeks I fully recovered and my taste came back (smell was still gone, rip.) all fine and dandy, cool, whatever. That is, until about three/four months ago, when my smell came back sour and my taste suddenly turned completely rotten, which leads me to today.

My smell and taste have hit a total road block in recovery. It’s just not happening. For the past four months I’ve had to avoid meat and other forms of protein, along with all of my quick breakfast and lunch foods. Snacking and sweets don’t exist for me anymore, I started having to skip out on dinner and find my own meals, which is a very limited pool for me to choose from, so a lot of times I just don’t try and I make myself go hungry. Even on days where I can stomach whatever is being cooked, walking into the kitchen is like walking into a wall of the smell of rotten meat and it just totally ruins my appetite and mood. I literally have to force feed myself most days. Sometimes I’ll cook something that was perfectly safe for me to eat the day before, only to take a bite and have to spit it out because it tastes so bad. It’s gotten to the point where the second I feel hungry, I get super anxious. 

I’ve basically gotten used to it. A few weeks ago I would have emotional breakdowns over it, but I’ve since learned some foods that I can rely on to be safe consistently. Thing is, it’s so few of them, and I’ve had a really hard time keeping variety in my diet because of it. I’m so sick of eating the same things every day, and I’ve found it a lot easier to convince myself to skip meals because of it. I just want my taste and smell back to normal, like I’m seriously so desperate. I saw one of my grandmothers for the first time in 8 years the other week and she made a chocolate cake that I couldn’t eat because chocolate tastes like vodka. I haven’t had a cup of coffee in months because it tastes like what I imagine literal poop tastes like. Peanut butter and honey sandwiches are one of my favorite foods but I haven’t had one in months because peanut butter tastes like dog shit smells. I’ve been surviving on blueberry oatmeal and chamomile tea for the past month. Do you know how much oatmeal you can eat in a week?????

I eat fine and am healthy weight. I like food that tastes good obviously but it's more like I eat to stay alive. Anyway, I have several things about food related things and eating that make me really anxious.

1. When people around me describe food they've had or start praising some food. Every word describing food makes me feel physically ill. For example when a coworker tells me she bought some sort of food/treat and proceeds to tell me ""It was so good/delicious/yummy"" ect. I get so angry but I just suck it up.

2. Disclaimer, I have nothing against heavier people. But I don't know why I get so anxious eating with heavier people. I feel like I am obligated to eat equal or bigger amount of food as that other person and it has to be equally as healthy/unhealthy. 

3. Eating noices. It was bearable before covid, but now that I have had to spend all my lunch breaks alone and haven't been exposed to all the sounds, I feel horrified of the idea of us being able to eat in the same space again. Everyone else seems so excited while I'm terrified of having to listen to the eating sounds. Also the motion of people's jaws and faces when they chew and swallow the food, I think it something about the repeatedness. I used to think I have misophonia but I realized all these other things can't be linked to that.

Hello, Everyone!

I've never been diagnosed with an ED, but I'm curious if I have one developing, and I was wondering if you guy's could possibly give me some insight on the matter.

I've never been skinny, always on the ""chunky"" side. I was never bullied for my weight, but it's something I have always been very insecure about. A year ago I realized i gained alot, and was at my heaviest. I started intermittent fasting, lost some weight, and was feeling better, and it was never an issue. So Quarantine happened, and I gained some back. Well fast forward, I started intermittent fasting again, and I'm down to I would say an slightly above average weight? Idk, cuz I personally CAN NOT see a change in myself. i see the same person as before... blubber for days, but others have noticed, and keep giving me compliments. Saying ""you're looking so good!"" So i didn't before? ""What are you doing?! Omg, teach me your ways"" which in a sense makes me feel like they're envious of my weight loss (which i know sounds TERRIBLE, but that lowkey makes me feel good about myself), or people will make remarks about wanting to ""be my size"" which I'm not even that ""small"" when i look at myself?!

So to get to the point of this post, my intermittent fasting has turned into me just not eating some days, or if i do eat, i feel SO FUCKING GROSS and TERRIBLE that i just want to make myself throw up and cry. When i even think of eating lately, it makes me sad and disappointed in myself. I just want to be skinny. My boyfriend doesn't want me to lose anymore weight either, which sort of makes me mad. I'm not sure if i am going down an ED path, or if I'm just being too insecure about myself? I also don't want to tell my bf, friends, or family about this because i don't want them to try and make me eat more lol because i lowkey WANT this so i can be skinny, WHICH MAKES NO SENSE &amp; DOESN'T SEEM HEALTHY?!

2073,EDPostRequests,1622281674,nnk1xa,"[ I've never posted in a Reddit community before, hopefully I do this correctly. Apologies in advance for the long vent post] CW - discussion of unhealthy eating habits, past abuse (mentioned briefly without detail)

Around 2018/2019 I was at an extremely high-point of stress in my life, and was eating very little. This negatively affected my health to the point where, when I finally did take a trip to my college's dining hall, I passed out in the middle of my food being prepared right in front of me. I can feel myself slowly regressing back to that point, isolating myself and feeling justified in treating myself badly, and I hate how closely I'm inching back towards that mindset. 

Currently I [20M] am taking a break from school and am unemployed (I have a job offer lined up that I'm really hoping works out for me, as I haven't been employed since August 2020 when I was forced to stop working while escaping my abusive household, and I've spent my time since recovering and seeking therapy). The issue surrounding food avoidance resurfaced for me a few months after settling into my new life, away from my abuse situation and in a shared apartment with roommates I care deeply for. I struggle with diagnosed anxiety, ADHD, major depressive disorder, and OCD, and these issues combined make it very difficult to motivate myself to eat, even when I know it's affecting my physical and mental health. My paranoia and anxiety has been at an all-time high again more recently for a multitude of reasons, and stress affects my appetite horribly. I also constantly battle with finding safe foods that I feel I can eat because of my ADHD, and in the past several months I've found myself unable to hyperfixate on any sort of food, which makes me feel completely unmotivated to attempt feeding myself at all. If it involves any sort of preperation I just won't eat, regardless of when I intend to eat said prepared meal. It feels like work that isn't worth it. I don't look forward to eating anything. The concept of just snacking makes me feel extremely guilty, like I'm doing something wrong and unhealthy when I graze, assuming I've actually gotten myself to snack on something without letting it go stale or moldy upon either no longer caring for said food or forgetting it exists entirely until it's too late. The only thing I actually enjoy consuming is coffee, which worsens my anxiety if it's the only thing I've had during the day, and it usually is. I feel guilty even adding more than a couple  drops of flavored creamer into my mug in the morning, as ingesting products with large amounts of sugar contribute hugely to my guilt surrounding food. 

At this point I can barely manage a meal a day, and if I have more than that it's usually a result of my roommates offering to buy me something, which only weighs heavier upon my ever-growing sense of guilt, especially when they often refuse to accept money to pay for my share of whatever dinner they've gotten delivered. I know their finances are only a little better than my own. It feels like I'm taking advantage of their kindness, or manipulating them into feeling bad and spending their hard-earned money on someone like me. I feel like I'm trapped in a horrible cycle. I'm always in a terrible mood and feel unbearable to be around. I've started isolating myself again. I'm sure my eating habits are a major factor in my negative mindset, but just being vaguely self-aware doesn't magically warp my eternal bad attitude out of existence, though I sure wish it did. I feel trapped in my own brain. I feel unlovable, like maybe being completely and doubtlessly valued is just genuinely something that's meant for some lucky people and not me. Like this is just how I'm fated to be as a person, and whatever greater purpose I want to think is out there doesn't even exist. I feel hopeless. I feel selfish for wanting more. I know my struggles with food are valid, but even assigning it the title of ""eating disorder"" feels like I'm taking something away from people with real problems. I feel lazy and childish and overdramatic for having so much difficulty with something that could be solved by simply eating something, anything, but if it doesn't sound at least semi-decent I can't force myself to do anything about it. At least addressing my food avoidance is somewhere to start, even if writing out this whole post so far has felt grossly theatrical, albeit extremely accurate to how I'm feeling. Addressing and my true feelings and revealing them to others is one of the most difficult tasks for me. I hate feeling vulnerable, or like my issues are a burden on others. I guess it feels good to identify my own emotions in a decently-worded manner. Writing this out was very difficult for me, so thank you for taking the time to read through my huge blocks of text, I do genuinely appreciate it. 

I'm looking for any advice this community can provide in regards to my post (neurodivergent-friendly food suggestions, similar experiences you've had to my own and how you've dealt with it, or anything else you think would helpful for me to read). Worth noting in case you have suggestions, I don't have any food allergies. I don't care for most sweet/dessert-y foods, but I find that I usually prefer salty and/or meat-centric meals. I don't dislike cooking generally, but the more time/effort something requires of me the more it significantly diminishes my general food-making motivation.

I’m 17. My whole life I’ve been underweight. I would skip breakfast and lunch because I had no time to prepare food and I’d only eat supper and wake up at 1am and eat my whole fridge. I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression and for that I had to eat 3 meals a day and establish a routine. I also got on depo provera that time. I quickly gained and am now overweight.. I stopped gaining weight once I stopped depo provera and now whenever I eat I feel nauseous?? Like yesterday it took me an hour to eat a bagel. Even when I’m hungry I have a hard time eating or I feel like my body is blocking me from taking in any food.. Like I’m repulsed by it. I have no idea what’s going on but I weigh myself every. single. day. And every time I feel nervous but I still step on the scale. I lost weight since last year but I’m still anxious about gaining. Just last year I’d eat so much and all I could think about was food. I was in a bad relationship and the only thing I ever did was sleep and eat and if I ate something that didn’t satisfy me I’d get upset.. Every time I mention these things to my mom she mocks me and says it’s all in my head. I’m really questioning wether or not it’s real. I have no idea what to think anymore.

Hello, First of all sorry for my bad english, and sorry if this isnt the right place to post this but ive been looking everywhere and can't find any answer. I will get my COVID vaccine soon and i'm looking forward to it. The thing is my bmi is in the severely underweight category and I'm really scared that my body won't be able to take the vaccine well. My mom is a healthy weight and felt really bad after getting her second injection so i'm kind of terrified. I'm not very good at handling being nauseous/not having appetite/having diarrhea, which some people reported having after their second dose, as i'm trying rlly hard to recover and those things are very triggering to me. But most of all even though i didn't see any counter-indications on the internet for being vaccinated while underweight i'm scared sh\*tless of dying from the vaccine I tried looking up everywhere on the internet, even asked on forums and called national helplines. Everyone keeps telling me to ask my doctor but i can't see them rn (bcs of reasons). My mom took an appointment for my vaccine in june but i'm really nervous.

tl;dr has anyone here gotten or know someone who has gotten the COVID vaccine while underweight/severely underweight and turned out fine? Was the second dose particularly hard to handle? (idk if i can mention the name of the vaccine but i'll probably get pfizer)

2082,EDPostRequests,1623287575,nwbeii,"Help. I went to the doctor because, to be honest, I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a long time now, and my lack of interest in eating has spiraled out of control. Don't get me wrong, as a kid, yes, I was picky, but I loved to eat. I would binge eat like crazy. All I wanted to do my whole life was gain weight. But when I was 18 I had an illness causing stomach ulcers which made it unbearable to eat. I would take a few bites and clutch my abdomen in pain. My new doctor thinks this may have caused me to develop a negative association with food in my brain which has persisted even though the pain is gone. 
Things did get a little easier in time after the ulcers went away, but when I was 21 I went through a pretty awful breakup and I've been gradually losing weight since. Now I'm 23, 5'6' and only xxx lbs (underweight bmi)  which must be my lowest weight since middle school. I basically starve myself until 4pm, then eat just enough to get myself through the night, and I despise exercise which is just sad as I've been an athlete my whole life. 
The depression and anxiety started when I was roughly 16 I'd say, but it's been the hardest in the past year or so. Last July I found myself having suicidal fantasies, so I started counseling briefly, until suddenly I felt it wasn't worth anything. Shortly after, I found myself in situations I had never been in before. I was a SB here and there and even flew to Vegas spontaneously with a girlfriend. I ran up my credit card bill, and developed intense feelings for her at the time, but felt so much shame at the end of all this that I isolated for a solid month. I keep going in and out of these cycles and patterns in my life, and I feel like I'm constantly slipping (but honestly it's like I never really came back to myself). I don't know where to begin or end with all this. There's been so much, I don't know when the unraveling started or when I started starving myself.
My doctor thinks I have an undiagnosed eating disorder, though she confirmed it isn't anything basic like anorexia or bulimia. She wants to start me on a mild dose of Paroxetine until I can get into counseling to sort all this out. I'm worried about the side effects and I'm worried about the withdrawals. I have a new guy in my life, and I don't want any loss of libido, but also, I don't want to crash into depression again when we inevitably end.
Has anybody ever tried using this drug for eating disorders, possibly to gain weight? She said it may temper my personality, which would likely help. Lift my mood.

I think it might have been a mixture of SAT-studying stress, pre-college stress, my toxic family, and maybe my dance teachers calling me fat (I wasn’t big by non-dancer standards, but, you know). My doctors have always treated it as anorexia because I’m so underweight, they face me away from the scale when they measure me and don’t tell me the numbers. And my weight becomes the object of every visit which is so annoying. My doctor tells me I am “clinically anorexic.”

I don’t THINK I have a problem with food. I never think about calories or anything. I even look forward to eating good meals.

Last year it was binge eating and then I was working on unrestricted eating which helped for a while, but then I started restricting again and was feeling really stuck mentally. 

So I got a therapist who, despite asking for an eating disorder specialist, is not one. The first thing she told me was to choose a goal to work on (her examples included a goal weight or BMI, I said I just wanted to feel stronger again and I don’t use a scale, but I’m having a hard time not thinking about weightloss 24/7) Her using those examples has really freaked me out and when I brought that up she said I could lose weight in a healthy way, I just don’t know how yet. She said it may be unrealistic for me to be happy at my current weight if I don’t feel good in my body, and if I lose weight it will help me feel better because I’ve accomplished a goal.

She doesn't eat much throughout the day but usually has large dinners, and throughout the pandemic she's been snacking more and more late at night.

There are a few signs that point to her having potentially binged and purged in my childhood, which I never recognized til now. Going to the bathroom after dinner, always chewing gum. I guess you don't always see that stuff when you're growing up.

For the sake of this, I am going to call my friend Amy. She had a pretty intense eating disorder in the past that almost landed her in the hospital from the age of 15-18. She thankfully had recovered and did outpatient care and therapy. She is someone who of course still feels the remnants of that ED and also deals with anxiety and depression. The past couple years she has been really candid online about her struggles and also her improvements and self-love. She really has seemed to be doing so much better and grown so much. I am so happy for her.

Although, recently I’ve noticed online that her weight has dropped off and I’m really concerned she might not be eating again. I’ve heard her mom is concerned as well. She recently just went through a break up so I wouldn’t be surprised if that sparked it. I’ve had talks with her about how she’s doing and she seems to be honest but hasn’t mentioned issues with her body image. Online she seems to be confident in her skin. I’m really not sure if I’m looking into it too much because hey! Weight fluctuates! It’s hard because we don’t live in the same place so I can’t be witness to her behaviours in life, I can only analyze what I see online. I also don’t know her close friends. I don’t want to comment on anything about her appearance because I know how destructive that can be in many ways. She is also a VERY sensitive person, it’s completely understandable and I don’t mean this in a bad way, it’s just very hard to bring up sensitive topics to her.

I adore my friends, but it causes me to set expectations for my image that I’m worried if I don’t maintain, they won’t like me as much.

2099,EDPostRequests,1622854506,nsjz9f,"I’ve (F27) had a pattern of what I think would be considered ED behavior since I was in high school, and I’ve been horribly aware of my weight and body shape since elementary school. I’ve always thought I was fat, even though logically I know I am not. I first started barely eating around my sophomore year because I felt like I had lost control of my surroundings, my dad was extremely strict and religious and violated my trust and privacy boundaries a lot (ex: we had a family meeting where he took my diary and read out of it and lectured me on being “impure” for wanting to make out with a boy), and stupidly, was upset about said boy. 

Ever since then I have fallen into the pattern of severely reducing my food intake whenever I am experiencing rejection in my romantic relationships, which has always been in the form of them being unfaithful or lying or both (I am now married and this is happening, I feel trapped). Occasionally other forms of stress will trigger it too, if it’s intense enough. When I see my body start to slim down, or my tummy flatten it only fuels me, because I attach my worth to how I appear, because if I’m pretty enough maybe I’ll be good enough to be the only person my significant other wants. 

At this point I don’t know how to stop, it feels like something I can’t control, my body does not crave food and when I try to eat I feel extremely physically ill and can’t eat normal portions, everything disgusts me except certain comfort junk foods. Sometimes I use thc to boost my appetite which helps but I do not enjoy being dependent on a substance just to eat. I don’t want to take antidepressants to boost my appetite either. 

I am fully aware of all of the horrors with health that comes with this kind of behavior. I am fully aware of WHY I am doing this. But it almost feels like I just don’t care, I just cannot stop, like I deserve it, like I’m not worthy of food or love because everyone I’ve ever loved has shown me that. It also feels like I have a sick sense of kinship with this behavior, like this is all I have to make things better, like it’s the oldest and closest friend I have. I acknowledged openly with people that I didn’t eat in high school but I can’t seem to label myself as having an eating disorder now, because I don’t know if I actually do or ever did, if that makes sense?

2108,EDPostRequests,1623892674,o1ksoy,"Hi. I (15f) have been struggling with a restrictive ED for over a year now. This led me to becoming extremely underweight and in a life-threatening condition. I had numerous deficiencies, amenorrhea, hypotension, bradycardia, and was at risk of heart failure. If I’d continued like I was, I knew I would probably die, but I had trouble caring. It was only seeing how devastated my parents were when my family doctor had me admitted to the hospital that I decided to comply with recovery. I chose it for them, not me. Stress got my heart rate up enough for me to leave inpatient quickly, though, and return home. About a month and a half later, this is still the case. I’ve more than doubled my caloric intake, but my parents and paediatrician want me to consume over a thousand more than I am now for rapid weight gain.

I can’t bring myself to do it, but my parents are counting calories and serving me food to ensure that I eat as much as they want. I’ve been lying and I feel absolutely awful for what I’m doing, but I can’t bring myself to stop. I’ve turned to either pouring drinks down the sink, flushing it down the toilet, or feeding it to my dogs (when safe for them) to avoid eating food. Has anyone else experienced this compulsion? I’m desperate to stop. I’m literally flushing money down the drain, and soon enough some doctor is gonna catch on that I’m not gaining as much as I should be.

Note that I am still eating enough to gain weight. I think I’m just scared of surrendering control and eating this much and not being able to stop once I’m at a healthy weight— I’m scared of spiralling out of control. Although I’m still eating enough, I’m still heavily restricting. I eat pretty much the exact same things every day, never daring to try something new, still counting calories (real calories, not the lies my parents know) and still can’t get out of the ashamed mentality that I have for eating.

The childhood-esque fear of getting in trouble for doing a bad thing to my body is so strong that I have avoided getting medical help all these years. I’m scared that ultimately, shame will prevent me from getting help. I ignore my body’s symptoms often because I can’t handle the guilt and shame and I want to pretend it’s not happening. But it is 😔

The only person I have told is my previous therapist, who moved away and I can’t see anymore. Due to the shame, I could tell her that the problem existed but we never worked through it. I was too afraid and overwhelmed to actually discuss it.

I have a new therapist who I haven’t told. I’m seeing her on Thursday.  Since things are pretty bad mentally, I’m thinking of disclosing (in the same vague terms as I used with my old therapist) to her. I’m worried that telling her (or even getting blood tests done) will overwhelm me. 

Tl dr; too ashamed and guilty to let medical professionals help me. How do I overcome this?

Much bloating, lots of skin breakout, dizzyness, bad performance during workouts, and I also haven’t got my period this month which I think could be linked to the diet. (I have lost my period a couple more times in the past during my ED and in early recovery.)
I didn’t start this diet to lose much weight, since I’m already on a healthy weight and I haven’t weighted myself in years in order not to trigger my old ED. I only wanted to shred off some excess fat around my belly for summer.
But during this diet I have found it to be much much harder to get full after a meal and I usually eat a second plate or I come back to the kitchen for snacks very quickly.
Since I’m not getting carbs I can not measure how much I’m supposed to be eating cause it’s so different than what I’m used to. So at first I thought I wasn’t eating enough, then I started eating more and now I fear that I might adopt to a binge eating habit and I really don’t want to get another ED after five years of recovery.

My point is I ignore problems I deem 'small' or something I can live with (to be honest this is a whole healthcare talk that needs to be had just not now or here).

So here I am sitting at plates of food I know I like and I can't tolerate it past a certain point. Things I've noted:

1. My mood can cause it to (and by it I mean the ability to just be unable to eat, trying to anyway makes me nauseous and queazy)
2. Other times my mood has no relation to it. I can be happy and unable to finish something.
3. Yes I do feel hunger. And I do eat but I will stop suddenly feeling full despite only taking one bite
4. It can happen for weeks or just once or twice a day.
5. I rarely throw up over it but it's possible if I become gluttonous and consume even when queazy kicks in.
6. I don't hate food at all. I just don't like it either unless it's what I'm craving

2128,EDPostRequests,1623622005,nz7agh,"I'm (16f) writing this post because I really need help as to how I should tell my friends (16f) we'll call 'C' parents about her eating disorder. Here's the backstory:

At the beginning of last year while school was still running normally, I noticed C rarely ate anything at lunch. She made excuses for why she didn’t do so and she would also be frequently looking at dieting posts and ‘healthy’ meals on instagram. Even before this began, I always noticed how she constantly looked at calories before eating anything. This behaviour worried me, but I never brought it up to her. A little while later, she confessed to me that she was throwing up everything she ate. I knew this was an eating disorder and she told me not to tell anyone, but I was very concerned and debated how I could have told her parents what was going on without revealing my identity. In the end, I didn’t end up telling them. If I could go back in time and change one thing, I’m not kidding you making that decision would be it. If I had told her parents right away I could have saved her so much pain and I feel so much regret for not doing so. Fast forward a couple months when we were talking one day and she told me that she told her dad everything that was going on, how she was throwing up her food and that now they went on grocery trips together and bought (what she perceived was) healthy foods that she would eat. I trusted she was telling the truth because she is super close to her dad. I was so happy that she had told him and I thought this would be the first steps towards her recovery. Although she should be able to eat anything without feeling guilty or feeling like she needed to throw it up, whether that be ‘healthy’ or ‘junk’ foods, not just with ‘healthy’ foods. I was just so happy that she was eating. I thought everything was going well until a few months ago when one day on our walk she told me that she wanted to start working out. I told her to take it very slow and to make sure she was fuelling herself with food and water so she could have lots of energy. She often made negative comments about herself and how she hates her body so I was a bit worried she would develop unhealthy habits but if she started slow, I thought she would be okay. In the past few months, I have noticed she has lost a significant amount of weight which is not something I would usually comment on but I think it’s important to bring up here. It has been so drastic that even my mom has asked me if she is okay. A couple months ago, she told me she hadn’t gotten her period in 5 months which I knew was a sign of under-eating and not getting enough nutrients in her body so this made me worried that she wasn’t eating at all or she was not eating enough. The last time we saw each other, she told me she still hadn’t gotten it and it had now been 7 months. That same day she told me that she works out for 2 hours which really shocked me! This is an excessive amount of time to be working out so I am really worried she is under-eating and over-exerting herself. She also said to me (something along the lines of) “If my thighs were as small as my calves everything would be fine.” I’m really worried about what kind of habits she has developed and I think they are affecting her physical health in a very negative way. 

I cannot put into words the amount of regret I feel for not having told her parents when she first told me. A couple weeks ago I wrote a letter that I was planning on emailing to her parents from a fake email address that basically mentions everything I said above. I saw her again today as she came over with her mom and sister and the entire time I was thinking about the letter and literally felt like I was going to throw up because I was so guilty and nervous and as soon as she left I went to my room and cried and was shaking (I know this sounds way overdramatic but I feel so guilty every time I think about her or talk to her or her parents).

A few days ago she also informed me that she spent 2 hours at the doctors and that she had to follow up with him. She didn't tell me much about it but when I tried asking her about it she didn't want to talk about it, so of course I didn't push. I have no idea if it has anything to do with this but I'm starting to think it might. 

Anyway, I really want to tell her parents everything I know, but I don't know how. Should I send them the email? My mom and her mom are really good friends so should I tell my mom and have her tell her mom? Or should I meet with her in person (it's probably the best way but I'm so scared she's going to hate me for not telling her earlier which is stupid cause I should be putting my friends health before my feelings).

I have to be very vigilant still, and I'm very aware that some parts of my recovery process have been basically against all medical and psychiatric advice. For example, part of my success has been releasing myself from feeling like I need to depend on doctors, therapists, or medication. NOTE: I do not recommend this for anyone else.

At the doctor's visit, I asked for my weight to be recorded backwards and for the medical assistant who took it not to tell me the number. She didn't and was very respectful about it. But then, the weight was ALL OVER the screen showing my chart and history while the doctor went through it all with me.

My partner has an ED that involves both restricting/purging and recently it got so bad that his health was declining. I read up on some studies that essentially scared me, particularly with purging, and we tried to establish some healthy boundaries together that would keep him safe.

Here's where it gets messy:
His therapist had just offered him a treatment program that took months to be approved for-- by the time he was approved, he had just been hired for a new job. He couldn't do both, he'd have to quit his job to do this 2 month program. At the time he told me he was doing better with his ED and I said the decision was up to him-- if he felt he was OK then I felt that it was also important to have a stable income since he was having a hard time finding a job after the pandemic. 

Except I found out that he'd been lying to me about how bad it was and it was serious enough that we got into an argument because I'm so afraid for his health. I found out his therapist left him because he refused to take the program. If I had known how bad it was, I would have encouraged him to take the program and I'd support him financially as much as possible. I don't know what to do, because he realizes it's bad but he sounds more concerned about reaching his ""goal weight"" before going into treatment. He's upset about the idea of gaining in treatment, and I've tried to be supportive but I feel like I'm sitting by and letting his ED consume him. He said he doesn't want to be like this anymore but I sometimes feel like I'm being gaslit by his disorder when he's convincing me ""it's not that bad"" or ""I've only been restricting this much for x days"", etc.

I don't know what to do, I don't want to micromanage, I've tried to make all his triggers easier by helping plan grocery lists and getting groceries for him, making sure he always has ""safe food"" available, exercising together so he doesn't overdo it (another issue he has). I remind him all the time how much I love him and any little progress he DOES do I am quick to acknowledge and support. 

Is there anything else i can do? I'm stressed out but I fear if I don't try to help more I will be complicit in his self-harm.

this has made me so so stressed, the recent weight loss has made my hair fall more frequently and i deal with a mood instability that makes me mentally drained all the time (idk what this, if it's a mental illness or not because i've never seen a therapist) and overall it just makes everything harder, but since i've never experienced bulimia or have been diagnosed as anorexic i can't really tell if i'm being a fraud or if i should actually try to work my mental set to go get some professional help, but like i said this has been frequent since my early teen days and i learned early about some eating disorder terms and habits thanks to tumblr, but the only thing I have tried has been fasting and drinking only water for as long as i possibly can.

While I'm still restricting slightly, I am restricting far less than I once was. I can feel myself becoming stronger, slowly, yet am surprised that my hair is still falling out quite a bit. I know I need to get myself to a place where I'm not restricting at all, but I still would've thought that increasing my calorie intake drastically would at least help curb the thinning some.

I’d been trying to lose weight for a while but never had time to workout and I went out too often to have a clean diet. Quarantine however let me have the time to regularly exercise and diet which helped me to lose a good amount of weight in a few months. I didn’t realize then but realized later that I was restricting myself way too much and justifying it by saying “if you want results, you gotta work for it”. And I would binge a lot on cheat days. I later realized these are symptoms of bulimia. Earlier this year I started self-induced vomiting and that’s just made things worse. I decided to recover and so in April I stopped dieting and it was going great for 2 weeks until I took a photo w a friend on an occasion and then when I later saw it I felt like I looked fat (I probably didn’t). But that just made me go into a hate spree and I decided to diet again. And so the binge purge cycle started once again. But this is making me miserable, especially with added stress from college. I really don’t wanna be worrying about my body and food all the time. I know the right thing to do would be to stop dieting and start eating intuitively but I am so scared of gaining weight.

We have already helped her find a therapist, and have her first appointment scheduled. I'm hoping to find information on how to make this as easy as possible on her. How could I cook for her? Should I push her to tell me what she wants from the grocery store, or just stock the house with food I know she likes? How can I keep up with what's going on with her without making it feel like I'm invading her privacy constantly?

Hi beautiful people! I'm a 21F looking for advice in a world that seems to have no answers. A little bit of background: I have struggled with disordered eating for a big chunk of my life but I have been committed to recovery for over 3 years now. I love the peace that recovery has brought, and I'm very scared of losing it. Nevertheless, I'm at my highest weight ever and while it doesn't necessarily bother me, all I can think of when I look in the mirror is of how my fat phobic friends and family perceive me. They make comments about how much better I looked before, and I feel the urge to go back to those behaviors just to be more visually pleasing. It might be all in my head, but I feel unsafe in this bigger body in some way. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice? Attempting ""healthy"" weight loss has never gone well for me, so intentional weightless is not an option, but I feel desperate to feel fully accepted in my community. Thank you so much in advance for reading, and for you moderators if you accept my post.

I just have a question in terms of moderation ... Basically I will binge eat when unhappy or upset and even when not hungry/full I will just continue to eat. Now I've spoke to several people about it and they've told me ""You just need to learn moderation"" say have just the one chocolate bar and not eat the full pack.
In my head i'm thinking well if someone had an alcohol or drug problem or any other addiction for that matter you wouldn't say ""Oh well just have one pint of beer"" or ""Oh just have one hit of heroin.

2144,EDPostRequests,1624406814,o60x3l,"Hi All;

Quick background - early 40s, F, single and I have had an ED (to my estimation) for the past 12 years. about 8 years ago my girfriends had an intervention with me about my weight loss and my size and were concerned for my health (which I was able to concede eventually at the time, I was indeed suffering from an ED and it was causing health problems) I also agreed at the time to understand ED's are not ever cured but instead we must be consciously aware of them for life. 

I then began to gain weight again (yoyo up time) and silly me forgot EDs  life long hold. I proved overtime my ED was in fact NOT all behind me. 

About 5 years went by and I was realizing I had begun to swing the other way. I was a junk food addict.  I up-ed my exercise to stop the gain (blame excercise not food) but it did nothing.  Then it peaked last year (adding in the pandemic) and sadly I had gained too much, my health was starting to suffer from over-weight problems. So I decided 2021 would be a year to rectify and get back to healthy again. To find a happy medium. And to make myself accountable for it and do it consciously! 

So never being a stranger to EDs, I made my healthy meal plan, spoke to one of my GFs to be my moderator/ sponsor (AKA - she would hold me accountable to be safe while loosing, and report me if I was being unsafe.) I also refused to be a scale hugger (only weigh in once a month - not 3 times a day like before) and tried to go at this safe.  And its worked! I hit my goal weight this month. I am so grateful for my friends and family to help me, but its not over yet sadly.  And being at the ""healthy"" finish line, I have hit a snag. 

Problem is I have passed my loss limit (not by much) but I am still dropping. My GF sponsor is fully aware and I just told her the numbers (nothing to concerning but its notable). I want to tell her and my doctor that I will stop loosing, but I am worried I won't know how.  I started adding calories back to stop it but its not helping. 

Therefore, I'm hoping someone here has healthy ways to begin a maintaining weight plan. (not so much calories/ foods/ exercise) but perhaps tips around times I eat, or exercise. Or skills around making sure I don't panic about a pound here or there fluctuations. Since I am concerned about the loss, I am planning to weigh myself more often to make sure I'm stabilizing but I am fearful of a relapse (becoming a hugger again). 

As I am sure  others on here can vouch for, being the size and weight you want *SHOULD* be time to be happy and proud. I am sadly not feeling this, instead I feel a bit stressed knowing that I am no longer in a loose mode/ (or gain mode) and I never tried to find a ""happy or stabilizing"" mode. Is there anything I can do to be happy and confident as I am sure stress is not going to help this process. 

Any advice most welcome. TY",Request: Suggestions for Maintaining - This is new for me,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/o60x3l/request_suggestions_for_maintaining_this_is_new/,1624428414,22-06-21 19:06

He’s very body positive and not fat phobic towards me or anybody else, but lately I’ve noticed him body checking himself a LOT. Every time he walks by the mirror, he looks at his body from all angles and sees how far his stomach is sticking out, he does this more times a day than I can count. We’ll be watching TV and he’ll get up to do this and then immediately go back and sit down. He also started skipping breakfast, and when I try to get him to eat something he says he’s not hungry, and most days he’ll skip lunch too and claim he just forgot. He confessed sometimes he tries to see how long he can go without eating, just out of “curiosity” but I think it’s more than that. He has noticeably lost weight, despite the fact that he was already thin to begin with.

I’m 30 now and but this habit seems to stay. There is a lot of emotional eating and withholding involved. Because of it, I have had to face a myriad of health issues. I got pancreatitis and it gets flared with high fatty food. So either I don’t eat at all, or I eat a lot of high fat content food that has triggered many pancreatitis episodes. Similarly with exercise…either I over-exert myself or I don’t exercise for months altogether. 

Food is not a means to survive for me but a means of enjoyment or punishment. I’m in therapy and this is the realization I have reached. But nothing has come out of it. Unfortunately, there has been throughout my life, a lot of fat shaming from near and dear ones. But I feel like I made space in my life for the comments, I engaged with them so I am part of the problem here. 

I would really appreciate your thoughts and any tips on how to rethink my relationship with food and what are your eating habits like?

She got upset and left the room, and came back a bit later still carrying a worsened mood but would talk to me. She was getting ready and looking in the mirror when she mumbled ""whatever"", which she does when she's annoyed (often at me). I ask what's upsetting her, and to summarize she gets upset that I assume it's about me (the tattoo), that I think her ED struggles just go away, and that they aren't bothering her even when she seems ok. 

I apologize and say that I thought she was upset at me because she her mood changed following the tattoo conversation. She says I never stop when she asks to, shouts at me some, and leaves.

Since the pandemic started, my sister began to restrict her meals (she still takes three meals a day but she admits that it's only because of how strict my parents are about making sure we don't skip meals). She started to exercise regularly, which seemed fine. Over the course of last year, she lost a bunch of weight visibly and my (very South Asian, not too sensitive) family made sure they told her how much they've noticed it. When she went back to school, her friends and teachers commented on it too (which made her feel worse, as she told me, ""Does this mean I was really that fat?"")
I had been feeling strange about it and so have my parents, because she used to snack earlier and give in to cravings and now she completely stopped any of that. There were multiple fights over it. Now, she has confessed to me that she's acknowledging that her relationship with food is strained. She has been counting calories on an app for months and even when she deletes the app, she often remembers by now what dish is worth how many calories. She cried to me and said that she thinks she's going to get worse. She also explained that she sometimes spits her food out in the bathroom (no throwing up) because she feels guilty with every spoon that she takes in. On the days she does not exercise, she feels guilty about eating anything at ALL. Basically, it is something that has been bothering her, disrupting her everyday functioning, and actively visible in the way she continues to reduce her eating.
I haven't experienced anything like this in this magnitude. I really want to help her (and she also does want to help herself), just don't know how. I told her that the next time she wants to spit her food out, she should come to me and we will swallow a bite together. And when she is craving chocolate but is stopping herself, to take a small piece and swallow it with me.

2167,EDPostRequests,1624009889,o2lfjl,"Hello, 

I have struggled in the past on and off with disordered eating (most closely resembling BN, but never sought diagnosis, just recovery). My most recent and most severe lapse was last year during quarantine, wasn't fun. 

With the help of my therapist and husband I managed to stop all behaviors, as I knew I wanted to start a family and my body needed to be able to support a baby. I gained a lot of weight obviously, reaching an overweight BMI, and felt very uncomfortable in my body. Then I got pregnant. 

My morning sickness was bad, and I ended up genuinely unintentionally losing a lot of weight in my first trimester. This I think is what triggered me, the weight loss felt fantastic. I was miserable of course I felt like I had the flu for nearly 2 months straight, but I was weighing myself every week to track how much I'd lost. Sometimes if I had a good day and could eat a lot of food, instead of being happy for the calories I managed to get in to fuel me and baby, I would agonize on whether to resort to old behaviors to compensate. I never did, thankfully. I've been able to put me and baby ahead of ED, but...it was harder than I'd like to admit to make that decision sometimes.

Now my nausea is gone and I feel great, and I know I'm going to start gaining soon, which is GOOD because you need to gain a certain amount in pregnancy for a healthy baby, even if you have an overweight BMI like I do. But even at a lower weight now than when I got pregnant...I'm starting to show, my belly is bigger. But I honestly just look...fatter than before. It doesn't look like im pregnant yet properly. I just have a big tum.

And im just suddenly so disgusted by my body again. I hate it. Not even just my belly, everything I can hate thr size of and want smaller, I do. I've always heard how pregnancy really makes you appreciate your body and see it in a  new way because its creating life...but I feel fat and ugly and I just want to keep losing weight. I'm avoiding scales because I'm scared at how upset I will be. But when I have to weigh myself at the doctor every time that number is seared into my brain.

I guess I just wanted to get out there how im feeling, and see if anyone has been in the same boat, and has any words of wisdom or advice for me because I feel like one heckin failure right now for having these thoughts even though I love my little baby in there and want him to be healthy and happy. I want to do, and eat whatever it takes, but im scared of my own thoughts and scared that even though so far I've been able to push through and do what I gotta do...that one day ill fuck up. 

I wanted to feel in love with my body, not be thrown back into destructive ED thoughts.

Some infographics describing the eating disorder I'm talking about.

It's called Food Avoidance Emotional Disorder and has only been studied in children even though I have it as an adult (23), hence why the information is geared towards younger audiences. It's a subset of AFRID and I think posting about it could help some individuals who are struggling but don't know what's going on.

For people with FAED, when we get really anxious/stressed/depressed we no longer have any appetite and can feel extremely nauseous instead, even if we were hungry before our bad mood hit us. Trying to eat food can result in vomiting. If you're someone like me who's depressed/anxious frequently this means you'll be taking in very little food, similar to someone with anorexia. 

TW speaking about BMI and weight 

As said in the infographics people with FAED typically look like and have the physical symptoms of an anorexic; very low BMI (17.3), gastro issues, severe anaemia, ect. 

Unlike people with anorexia we don't have a desire to be thin and actually want to put on weight.

I’m currently grappling with a full fledged eating  disorder for the first time in my life, but I’m going to therapy and  really trying to overcome it. 

I have a very small circle of friends because of life circumstances.  One of these friends I see every now and then, she usually suggests  dinner or a drink which of course is extremely difficult for me. 

During the meal, she will mention several times that she either A)  did not eat at all until then, B) she worked out intensively that day,  or C) that will be all she eats for the day. 

Obviously, these comments are really triggering to me. I’m so  desperately trying to overcome my behavior of restricting food, but  whenever I’m out with her, she acts like it’s a normal part of every day  life. 

To my knowledge she does not have an eating disorder; she is just  insanely competitive about everything. In the past, she’s asked me about  how much money I make, tried to see if me and my boyfriend have gotten  in any fights, or even pried into any family issues I might be having  (her family situation is super rocky). I’ve suspected for years that she  has always tried to make things a competition between us and I can’t  stand it.

I used to have a pretty severe eating disorder. I would barely eat,  and then when I did I would see red and eat everything in sight. Often, I  would binge really unhealthy food, and then feel guilty and force  myself to throw it up. It was really toxic. But, I turned it around and  established a workout routine, started having a more stable eating  schedule, and gained a lot of weight to where I was healthy. Now, I'm  still pretty healthy, but I've always kept a really bad relationship  with snack foods. I will start and finish an entire large bag of chips  and it feels like I physically can't stop myself. My cravings often win,  and I don't know how to put a leash on my cravings. The worst part is,  after I binge I still have the gut instinct to throw it up to try and  undo the calories, fat, sodium, sugar, etc. Any advice on how to deal  with this?

Is this an eating disorder? I'm sorry in advance if this triggers you So, in the past few months there’s been a ton of shit happening in my life. Family issues, friend issues, my ex tried to commit suicide, it’s just been a lot.

I’ve been struggling with this for a while and my love ones have noticed, and I’ve asked them for help but I’m not sure if it’s just body dysmorphia?

I feel super panicked to eat certain foods, Let me give an example,

The other day, my best friend and my family and I went out to dinner. I had a swim meet and the only thing I had to eat before that was coffee, and one of those low calorie fiber one bars. I did go to work and I ran to target and I purchased 4 Alani nu energy drinks and two boxes of the fiber one bars, and some other non related food things but it was a lot of money I had spent on food.

My best friend came over before we went to dinner and she made a pop tart in my toaster. I told her she was crazy for eating one of those because they are full of sugar and I read this thing that someone literally died from eating one of those. Those things are just cookies basically. And she knows about my eating habits because its gotten better but then I would fall back into the bad path again. She asked me why I was freaking out about those damn pop tarts and I just said they are so bad for you. And she was like well yeah, but you gotta live a little sometimes dude. I said, yes I know.

When we got to dinner, the only thing I ordered was a side salad, which was xxx calories which was perfect for me. She ordered a thing of chicken wings and fries. She tried to put a couple fries on my plate and I quickly told her no. It was a different type of fear that I had felt. She was like, “ok dude.”

I was over at her house last night and her mom made dinner. I was a bit anxious to eat because I went to the gym after swim practice yesterday and I really didn’t want to waste all the calories I had just burned. I just decided to eat a little, because I knew she would flip shit if I didn’t eat, and so would her parents. I put 2 tiny pieces of the little chicken breast and maybe a tablespoon of the salad. Her mom noticed, she says “you eat like bird! Is that enough for you?” My friend says,”She used to eat more.” And then proceeded to give me a really hard look. I told her I’m fine and she doesn’t need to worry. I finished my dinner, and I was helping her do dishes and she was talking about how a milkshake would sound so good. And I told her “ew no” she said,”you used to love those, why doesn’t anything sound good to you anymore?” I said “I don’t know.” And I told her again not to worry and that I was fine and she worries way too much, which she does sometimes😂

We went to the grocery store and I was helping her shop and we were in the ice cream isle and I was so anxious. She’s my best friend, so sometimes we do stupid stuff, this time, I was sitting inside the cart. I was very tired and I was zoning out, that’s why I didn’t want to walk. She was talking about dessert, and I made a face. And she goes,”are you a sugarphobic now?” I feel like I am lol. And I said idk, and then I brushed it off again.

A few hours later My stomach was hurting a lot, so I was laying on her bedroom floor. She asked me if I was ok and I said yes. She told me that I could go home if I wanted to, and I told her I was fine. We were talking and my brain kept wandering and I kept forgetting what I was talking about. She went to the kitchen and got an ice cream bar, I said,”how can you eat one of those things” and she was like because they are good, and you should have one too. And I said,”no I’m tired and I’m going home” so I got up and then I said, are you going to walk me out? Bc she always does! And she said no. I mean it was fine.

Hi there, F34, first time here on reddit. I have recently come to the conclusion that I have an eating disorder, I'd say it's some sort of anorexia, but I only ever find resources about anorexia nervosa, which I think is not my issue. My problematic relationship with food is rather a consequence of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and ADHD. I've had episodes of complete loss of appetite since I was a teenager, sometimes it would last days, sometimes weeks, but it would always be linked to some sort of preoccupation that led to anxiety (important exam, new job, heart break and such). I've had only one episode of some sort of bulimia, where I would feel hungry all of the time, which lasted about a month. In the end I never worried too much about it, because it would last a limited amount of time, and then things would go back to normal. But this year has been different. It's obviously been a tough year, psychologically speaking. But I first noticed a weight loss upon getting a serious parasitic infection, which makes sense. The problem is I never quite recovered appetite, cause depression and anxiety piled up, and then I started medication that also tends to lower appetite. Work has been really tough (I'm doing a PhD overseas), and the work load and stress is just too much for me to actually care to think about food. All in all, I lost xxkg in less than a year (I'm 1m64 tall, and went from yykg to xxkg, which makes it 20%). In the past months I've also been exercising quite a bit, for I took dance classes that helped me cope with stress. Right now I'm trying to get into healthier habits, chill a bit, dedicate more time to my crafting hobbies, etc. I'v gotten more appetite, but when I do eat complete meals I end up feeling stomach sick, I guess because my body's not used to it anymore. So I guess what I need help with is, how to go back to a healthy diet, given that I've spent months eating very little, and that I have little free time and the whole ""planning for meals, going to the super, cooking, doing the dishes etc"" seems pretty overwhelming to me? What easy/quick/healthy food could I get? Any other recommendation or resource welcome.

I mentioned to my therapist on our call yesterday the fact that I really think I might have an ED. She agrees that there’s something up and we went through her little diagnosis book and answered all the questions for each. I was kinda leaning towards it being one thing but she really feels like it’s just unspecified. I’m a little confused now I guess. If it’s unspecified how do you know how to treat it? She also kept saying I wasn’t an unhealthy weight which was kinda invalidating because while yes I’m not currently an unhealthy weight I’ve lost a LOT of what I did weigh and I’m on the way to being underweight. I want to get a handle on this but I feel kinda discouraged that it isn’t anything really specific because it still just means I don’t know how to deal with it. I’m supposed to go on vacation to my absolute favorite place here in two weeks and I know I won’t cure my ED in two weeks I’d like to get motivated to start working on it and enjoying the food I used to love so much while I’m there.

&amp;#x200B;

My experience- I don’t really get super hungry anymore, nothing also sounds good. Sometimes I can think of a single thing that I could eat in that moment but it’s usually like something really specific and then when I get it sometimes it’s fine (I still only eat half) and other times I eat a few bites and it’s as repulsive as everything else sounded. I know I need to eat but I can’t find anything and then I have a panic attack. But at 11:30 at night I go ugh I’m hungry and I make a chocolate pop tart and a glass of milk even though the rest of the day food gives me anxiety or I just don’t care enough to eat. I also struggle with wanting to spend the money especially when I don’t finish anything I eat it feels like a waste (I try to do leftovers but I eat so irregularly that they go bad before I get to them or I just don’t want them)","Request: My therapist says I have an unspecified ED, how do you treat something if you’re not sure what it is?",https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/oatsju/request_my_therapist_says_i_have_an_unspecified/,1625067448,30-06-21 4:37

I now f19 have had issues with appetite since I was 15. Around 15 I started becoming underweight, because my appetite left. It’s like everything taste like card bored or makes me gag or has a really bad texture or taste, even if I love the food, because of the fact that I have no appetite.

Cannabis is the only thing that has helped me, I practically can’t eat without it. It’s helped me gain weight some. But now, even with the Cannabis it’s like my appetite issues it fighting through it, and My stomach isn’t able to eat as much. Im loosing weight again and it’s worrying me and I also feel weak all the time now, I feel like I’m starving all the time. I get this wave of nausea and a pit in my stomach a lot too, and I’ve realized it’s from hunger. I just want to enjoy my food and pig out. But I can’t. Now I’m also dizzy/nauseous through my eyes. This started when the appetite issues started up again. It feels like I’m stuck on a fair ride the ones that make you sick.

I am very uneducated about ED’s, but from my understanding, you normally care ALOT about your weight or body image and that causes you to shift your food and eating tendicies… my mom and brother and boyfriend all think what’s going on with me is an eating disorder.. but i don’t really care if I’m skinny or midsize… so Can it really be one?

I don't know if a trigger warning is in order, I mean this subreddit is called Eating Disorders so idk I'm 19, my sister is 20 and she's been bulimic since she was about 14. I knew about this then and then she got better, for a while  She never spoke about it much and she helped me through depression for years but didn't speak about her own struggle really. For the last two years she and I haven't been home together so I didn't know she wasn't well again, but a few days ago we came back home for the summer and I heard her vomiting in the bathroom after dinner.. It threw me back to when we were younger and I didn't know what to do except stand rock still behind the locked door and think emptily, until she opened the door and I acted like nothing happened or I left before she opened it. So there I was again, standing there like an idiot. I want to help so bad, especially cuz she's done so much for me and I love her infinitely, But behind a locked door I couldn't really stop her from vomiting and obviously that's not a thing

So I come here, to ask. How (if at all) I should approach talking to my sister about her eating disorder when she's so selfless and probably wouldn't want me worrying about her But I do, of course So should I say I know about it... And then what?

binged yesterday, but today I bounced back. Hello [r/BingeEatingDisorder](https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder), this is the first time I wirte here. I am 18M and normal weight right now I am not very active due to an overtraining injury that didn't heal properly (another binging problem I had, but that's another story). I don't have a binge eating disorder to the extent that some poeple on this sub have, but I do have my fair share of struggles with food, hunger and satiety, and to a lesser extent body Image. It is 10pm as I'm writing this post, and I feel like I wanted to share this story.

me, my mother (who BTW lost a lot of weight in 2018-2019) and her husband (not my dad, my mom is a single mother) are right now at a hotel. the hotel has breakfast and dinner. on thursday my family went to a restaurant, and I ate a pretty hefty meal around 5pm. then there was dinner and I was not hungry, so I ate a small dinner bc I know that if I don't eat something in the evening, I can't fall asleep (yes, it sucks). It was around xxx calories. friday morning (yesterday) I ate for breakfast a huge meal, and for dinner, It was a motherfucking feast. *meal details deleted*. I was absolutely conscious about that (although not completely under my control), and it was planned ahead (I told myself ""fuck it, I'll just eat undtil I'm stuffed because this is food that Isn't readily available at home usually"") after the meal I was stuffed as hell, and had a few mini-pukes. I told myself, while looking in the mirror and having my camera on ""I am worried for you [u/nothereforupvotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/nothereforupvotes), I don't want you to develop and eating pattern like this, of eating until you are stuffed and gaining fat. tomorrow you will eat 2 slices of bread, a small container of cottage cheese, an egg, and a lot of veggies, maybe a small savory pastry (kid of a trigger but I ate only a small one). understood?"" I didn't beat myself up as much (and when I did, I said ""this is an alarm going off, that something isn't right. I can do this without beating myself up"") which is an achievement bc I used to beat myself up after occasions like that"". "" then went outside for a little bit, wrote down my thoughts and feelings about this event and other events throughout the day, and then got into a convo with a friendly couple that also slept in the hotel. woke up at around 9am today (saturday), went to breakfast with my mom and kept that promise.was full, but not stuffed. then around 2pm there was lunch and I slightly overate (more than I planned) but not to the extent of what happened on friday It was much better. an hour ago I ate a large salad and a small bowl of mac&amp;cheese. I was proud of myself for bouncing back and not going to the other extreme like I see other people do on this sub. I am really happy for myself for not purging/starving like othe people would do, and wanted to share some tips that when I do have a successful time managing my eating.

find passions unrelated to food, or at least not eating it. music (huge one for me), hobbies, skills, shows on TV.

hard AF, but try to be compassionate with yourself. Instead as labeling yourself as a ""pig"" or a ""fatso)"" but telling yourself ""I have a problem, and it sucks. I want to have better habits and be able to control myself.

prepare your meals ahead of time, and eat low calorie dense foods that taste average to good, so they won't be extremely disgusting to the point of not being able to stick long term, but not extremely delicious so you'll be able to stop.

find an accountability partner with the same interest (for me it's my mom who tries to maintain a healthy weight and has a history with being overweight)

try and understand the root of your binges. maybe it's lack of other interests other than food, boredom, FOMO (a huge reason for me) trauma, mental health disorders, etc. I don't want to be a holier-than-thou, rather give people hope, BC this sub is at times very pessimistic.

tl;dr- went to a hotel, gorged insane amounts of food in the span of 30 hrs, but held myself accountable and bounced back with a healthy and relatively small breakfast, avoiding compensatory behavior.

Hi everyone,

I was wondering whether anyone would be interested in speaking with me. I am a student studying at an Australian university and currently working on my Honours project. The focus of my project is exploring how carers/the support networks of people with an eating disorder can be better equipped to support their loved ones.

Eating disorders are something I’ve had personal experience with, and I’m interested in finding ways to increase understanding of ed’s in the general public and, therefore, our friends and family members. By increasing their level of understanding, our family and friends may learn valuable tools to support their loved ones coping with an eating disorder.

As someone in the support network, your contribution will be highly valuable to the project outcome because it will provide me with a better understanding of the challenges you face.

I would love to hear your story, so if anyone is interested in having a chat and volunteering some time, please leave a comment &amp; I’ll send you a dm

So I havnt binged or purged in the last 2 weeks AT ALL. Partly because I was at training for work and didn't really have the freedom to eat as I usually would, and secondly because I was making an effort to use that time to jump start my process of quitting. Now that I'm home, I've gone 4 days without it but every day has been an absolute BATTLE. Last night I gave in and drove to a drive thru, ordered my food, got to the pay window and my card declined (found out it got shut off by my bank due to fraudulent activity) so I couldn't actually get the food. I went home and went to bed, thinking maybe that inconvenience was a blessing in disguise. But even today so far I'm so tempted to just go smash through some drive thru food. I havnt given in, but it just seems like now it's so difficult to resist it. Asking people that have recovered, how long did it take for the urges to subside? Do they ever go away or is this a life long battle?

Hi all,

My boyfriend was decently overweight before we started dating. He lost many many pounds very very fast over the course of 3-4 months by restrictive eating with no exercise. Though, because we were close friends at the time, and I saw him every day it didn't immediately hit me that he was losing weight extremely fast.

After those 3-4 months we started dating, and we've been together for 6 months. He's still losing weight, even though he really doesn't need to anymore. I try to be supportive and suggest regular healthy meals; but he doesn't eat more than once a day. I'm fairly sure his diet is causing him other health issues as well, but he's yet to make a doctor's appointment.

It's gotten a bit worse now since some COVID restrictions have been lifted, and he's started going to the gym on top of this. I'm just worried that this might get out of hand, and I'd rather try to stop it from getting any worse.

I know there's no possible way that he, himself, thinks he might have an eating disorder, or that his dieting is causing him these issues. If any of you have any suggestions on steps I can take to either make him aware of how dangerous this can be, or suggestions about what to do in general it'd be greatly appreciated.

2201,EDPostRequests,1625736511,og3ra2,"Hi, for context, I’m 22 and I embarked on a weight loss journey a year ago because I had gained weight over the pandemic. I lost a significant amount of weight and felt extremely good, I finally could go up the stairs running without catching my breath, my knees and back felt relieved and I loved the exercise that I was doing. I wasn’t cutting any food group, and ate dessert whenever I wanted, it felt like I was on the right track.

&amp;#x200B;

During my journey, I read and watched multiple videos on healthy weight loss and I was doing CICO while learning about healthy life. I never restricted too much, but I had some anxiety surrounding my caloric intake. I felt like I had to eat less than my calorie goal and it didn’t feel quite right. A few months after I started my journey we had a lot of issues at home, my sister got pregnant and my parents are extremely conservative. This took away my safe space and I stopped doing exercise and had to put up with my narcissistic parents and deal with their yelling and shaming. I was under a lot of pressure due to university work as I was doing my last trimester.

&amp;#x200B;

Christmas came around and I stopped tracking calories but didn’t eat extreme amounts of food, however, my mother would tell me that I had gained weight and my grandparents would constantly try to give me junk food, and I started to lose control over my diet. I would eat a lot and them try to get back on track and would fail miserably, I would always tell myself that I would try again on Monday…and fail yet again.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m in charge of making the food at home, and I simply cannot stop snacking and trying the food right before I was done cooking. My parents constantly buy junk food, en even though I like it, it triggers binge eating because I feel hungry afterwards. Right then, it was when things at home got extremely bad and I spiraled down into a depressive episode and I lost control. I eat whenever I’m nervous or anxious, and my anxiety has been on edge these past months. I know I need therapy and/or a psychiatrist, but I have no funds and my parents won’t do it, they just don’t believe in it. Recently I’ve tried to go back to tracking and I started exercising but I constantly fail, I cannot even look back at the MyFitnessPal app because it shows how much I had lost and I have gained most of it back. I really enjoy exercising and even joined a group where we all help each other out, but I’ve lost motivation recently.

When I was going into 7th grade, the month before school started, I just…didn’t eat. It wasn’t a conscious effort, I just didn’t feel like going to the kitchen to make anything.

I lost a lot of weight this way, and as I was overweight before, my mom noticed. She mentioned it and asked if I had anorexia but I said no, but what I noticed was that every time she mentioned me not eating, it made me want to go longer without food. I weighed myself a lot in this time.

Throughout the school year, my friends and one of my teachers commented, “you’re a twig” (and things of that nature) and “did you lose weight over the summer?”, respectively. For seventh and eighth grade, whenever I noticed my stomach was sticking out more than I liked, I would just think to myself “okay, just don’t eat until it’s flat”. I still ate a lot of snacks and food but I wasn’t physically able to eat as much as before.

My parents always comment on how thin I am, even though now I eat more (although very occasionally I feel regret when I eat a lot of snacks at once. I think of throwing up but I never go through with it), and I know I don’t have a healthy eating pattern, because I tend to go a long while without eating much and then I just eat a lot at once and the cycle repeats. I don’t consciously do it, but it happens.

My mom noticed I started gaining weight and mentions my stomach, arms, and face/chin a lot. I get kinda nervous when they take my weight at the doctors office because she asks them about my weight and how much I weighed at the last visit and I can’t tell what she’s thinking, as she has a poker face but also looks like she’s thinking. Before that summer before seventh grade, she also constantly talked about how I needed to lose weight and when I was a lot younger, she put me on a diet.

I don’t feel like this is an eating disorder, but is it?

TL;DR There was a period of time where I didn’t eat and wanted to stop eating even more when people commented about it or I noticed my stomach sticking out.

2204,EDPostRequests,1625736207,og3ozf,"I'm gonna try to give you the background info as quick as possible:

&amp;#x200B;

Struggled with eating disorders my whole life, starting at about 12 or so. Really toxic family-you're familiar I'm sure. I don't want to get into the specifics of how unhealthy my relationship with food and exercise was- but I was big into pro-ana tumblr if that gives you some kind of measure of where my head was at. Somewhere in 2015/16 I started working on it and became more comfortable with food, and slowly over time I just.. abandoned all diet and exercise. I felt like I couldn't handle looking at any kind of nutrition or workout routine in a healthy way so I just tuned it all out. Not so shockingly, I ended up putting on a lot of weight. But to be honest, I didn't mind. I liked not having the stress of diet or exercise preying on my every move and destroying my mental health. I didn't love my body but I was accepting of her new look and figured it was a fair trade for not having to think about food/workingout/looking perfect all the time. That's the background story, more or less.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Completely ignoring and avoiding something is not the same as healing from it and I came to recognize that. Since 2020 I've been slowly working on making healthier choices and being a little more active. And I liked it! This year I've started doing lots of activities that I've missed and feeling really good doing them. The last time I was active, it was a means to an end- I enjoyed the results and the process was sacrifice to achieve it. I forgot how great it is to run just for the pleasure of running. Physical activity feels amazing and brings me so much happiness! And I've been healing my relationship with food, making healthy choices for health's sake while still enjoying some less-than-healthy favorites. Honestly? I'm really happy with where I'm at and how I got here. It took years and I'm only excited to see where this goes. I would love to become more physically capable so I can enjoy more achievements within my new hobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it gets sticky:

&amp;#x200B;

Ana sits on my shoulder like a devil and whispers into my ear. I've noticed my own weight loss and I try not to give it too much space in my life. A part of me will always have that ED and I have to deal with that everytime I look in the mirror. That's a struggle on it's own, but one I've been managing.Everyone else, however, keeps commenting on my weight loss and its devastating. I'm aware that I've lost weight but I have been so so careful to make sure it's not a focal point for me. I don't count any calories or look at portions and I don't weigh or measure myself. I measure my progress in what I'm physically capable of. A few months ago I could barely run 3km. Last week, I ran 13km! I've put in a lot of work and I'm finally seeing progress.

&amp;#x200B;

I said that to a friend recently: that I had run 13km and I was happy to be seeing progress and he said, ""I'll say you can see progress! That shirt's hanging off you like a tent!"" A few people joined in behind him, remarking on my weight loss, singing my praises. My heart shattered. Weight loss hadn't even occurred to me as something worth being proud of. It was just a side-effect of my hard work. There I was beaming about my accomplishment and it was inconsequential compared to how i looked.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only do I have to work extra hard to make sure I keep my mind focused on what's important so I don't slip into a bad place- But that now that task feels impossible since it seems that everyone only cares about weight. It feels like I could run a marathon and they'd tell me how amazing I Look.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm disheartened. I haven't even lost that much weight (posting numbers is against the rules, but believe me, it hasn't been much and it's been over the course of months) and EVERYONE comments on it. I don't have a single person in my life who hasn't brought it up. It makes me sick and honestly? It makes me want to quit doing anything just so people stop talking about my body and my weight.

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm terrified the more I get praised and complimented for my weight loss- the louder Ana gets. The validation of people liking me and liking my appearance more is equal parts saddening and tempting. I haven't slipped up yet: I'm still eating well and I'm not over exerting myself but I am thinking about my weight and my body more. I'm finding myself longing for more weight loss- and this wasn't the case before people started commenting.

&amp;#x200B;

I needed that off my chest, but I'm also looking for advice. It's a struggle quieting my own mind against ED... but the struggle of standing up to others and quieting their voices in my mentalscape was a challenge I wasn't prepared for. I don't think people will understand if I try to explain, but then again how can I get them to take it seriously and stop fucking talking about it?",Request: Watching Myself Lose Weight Is Triggering- Everyone Commenting On It Is Hell.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/og3ozf/request_watching_myself_lose_weight_is_triggering/,1625757807,08-07-21 4:23

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest this is hard for me to write out so I’m just going to state some facts. I am underweight. I purge at least 3 times a day, and up until recently was running every day as well. Then I became too weak to really continue that and things got worse.

I am experiencing some health problems, I’m not sure what I am allowed to say but I am very weak. I have been to a doctor who said I was malnourished.

I've been underweight my whole life. I seem unable to gain weight even if I try. I don't really fear gaining weight- maybe a little afraid, but not much just because it seems unlikely that I ever would due to my eating habits.

I also love food. I'm passionate about cooking, baking, etc. Sometimes I have an issue with binging on desserts, and I do so privately so my partner doesn't judge me.

But most of the time, I under eat. I can't tell if I do it on purpose or not. I just take small portions and get anxious if I think about eating more. Sometimes I don't realize it's a small portion until after I take a picture of my food or something and then look at it again. I'll have a couple olives and feel guilty about it. I think the guilt is partially tied into financial reasoning and memories from a child where I was afraid about my parents being poor. If I have a binge eating session, the rest of the day or the next day I'll under eat to make up for the cost of the food I binged on. It's not like I'm in financial trouble now but I starve myself a bit anyway as a punishment or way of making up the lost money. When I'm stressed and having negative thoughts about my self, I'll also avoid eating too punish myself for being stupid or whatever it was that I was thinking negativity about.

I tried a version of a keto diet previously (not for weight loss) and became very obsessive over counting carbs and calories, and weighed everything I ate (including herbs) and tracked it. I think that opened my eyes to my general issue with food restrictions.

So, I want to ask if this sounds like an eating disorder. I'm a bit unsure because I really don't think about my weight much and I don't know if that's makes it not an eating disorder.",Request: Is this an eating disorder?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/offpwc/request_is_this_an_eating_disorder/,1625672960,07-07-21 4:49

There have been a handful of occasions where this feeling has gotten so bad that I’ve made myself purge, but I mostly find it difficult so I try to purge after I eat somewhat frequently but most of the time I can’t get anything up. I then tend to resort to excessive exercise in the gym, and also when I don’t meet my step goal I feel exceptionally guilty and pace around my room until I get 10k. I also count calories religiously and get very distressed when other people touch my food or cook for me because I don’t know how accurately I can estimate the calories. I know I have a bad relationship with food and I do talk to a therapist about it but I don’t know if I can call it a full-blown eating disorder because I’m technically overweight by bmi standards (mostly because of the amount of muscle I have as I lift weights 5x a week) and I don’t know if I’d call my weight loss “drastic” I’ve lost 10kg in a few months but then gained it back so I don’t know if I even meet the DSM criteria for Atypical AN.

Over the last year and a half, I lost weight very quickly. I began taking ritalin for my adhd and it made me nauseous to the point of not eating meals for a day or two at a time. Before that, I was always a healthy weight with some purging episodes when i was \~14 years old, due to body image issues. Those issues remained with me until last year. Now, at 20, I found i lost a lot of weight (especially in my breasts and butt) and feel very badly about myself. I thought i was so overweight before, up until a few months ago, but now realize i looked fine. Now on the other side of the spectrum, I feel very underweight and hate that i think i look underdeveloped for a girl my age.

I don’t know what any of this means, but i do know i am extremely nauseous all the time to the point where even if i want to eat, it’s difficult. I have been trying to gain weight and feel healthy again for almost a year now, but nothing’s changed. In fact, reaching out is partially due to my mom forcing me to weigh myself recently and saw I had somehow lost MORE weight. I haven’t had serious health complications/hospitalizations after losing weight, a few instances of almost-fainting (got better with rest) aside, and don’t know if my situation qualifies as an ED. I hate when people watch me eat (due to social anxiety), am extremely restrictive in intake when i thought i was overweight, and have body dysmorphia with any way i look.

I just dont know, should i definitely talk to my therapist about this? Could it be AFID? Anorexia nervousa? or is it not bad enough to be one of those, and is just disordered eating?

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and twelve sessions of tDCS during six visits over two weeks. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home–no in-person visits are required.

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

Hi, i just wanted to ask a question. I've been struggling with my weight for a while, it's an on and off thing, but i think it's getting worse.

I'm currently eating a sandwich while feeling very guilty and like i want to starve myself instead. In the past I've torn bills while hanging out with my friends to not be able to buy good cuz i was so anxious that they were going to see me eat and that I would look disgusting while doing it. I've had ideas of skipping meals but i never seem to go through with it, I've even thought about forcing myself to vomit.

I know that it can be bad for my health but i feel like i deserve this pain cuz i look so ugly.

I try to eat at least enough to maintain my weight so I don’t lose anymore, but that’s so hard on its own. I have this overwhelming need for control and order, and I need to stick to such rigid rules that don’t even matter, but with all my other diagnoses, it’s hard to… I hold it against myself, dissociate, and avoid eating because everything needs to be perfect and if it’s not, I can’t eat until it is… and it never will be, and so I hardly ever eat. It’s taken a toll on my body dysmorphia, making it the worst it’s ever been. I feel ugly the way I am, and I feel ugly if I gain any weight, and I just feel like I’ll always be ugly, so what’s the point in trying to recover? On top of that, I’m terrified of looking “womanly”. I’m nonbinary and I am constantly dysphoric about my body and appearance. I’m very fem presenting, but I’m terrified of looking any more womanly than I already do, and to constantly be perceived as a woman. Not eating somehow makes me feel more easy to pass as masc when I want to, but I’m equally as terrified as being seen as masculine as I am to be seen as feminine. I feel trapped in my body all the time because it will never look like how I want it to. It literally does not help that I relate my gender-fluidity more to cisness than transness—I always tell myself that I’m not trans enough and I get so hung up on trying to be female when I just genuinely don’t feel like that, and it’s a never-ending cycle that feeds into my eating disorder. And to make things worse, now I’m stuck in a depressive episode feeling both underwhelmed and overwhelmed with life, and I just wish I didn’t exist. I wish I could just return my life.

It’s like little Spongebobs running around my brain, throwing files everywhere, starting a fire. My emotions are off the walls, but I feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and numbness more often than not. It’s the complete opposite of my usual positive mindset.

My loved one says that the BMI scale does not apply to them since they are very tall (it doesn't really apply to anyone) but use this to deny that they are obese. They feel that since the BMI scale doesn't apply to them, there is no way to quantify? I guess? that their weight is too much. They have a very high body fat percentage and never intentionally exercise, and binge eat every day. (things like drinking several liters of soda in one sitting, eating nothing but sweets and pastries some days) They also spend our shared income on these excessive amounts of sweets, they buy a lot at a time and say that they're going to eat them slowly, but go through them in a day and go to restock.

We are unable to see doctors due to the high cost of medical, otherwise I would ask my LO to speak to a doctor about it directly. I live with them and their health does impact my quality of life as they are a caregiver for me.

Recently they had a health scare and it was a concern that their weight/unhealthy diet may have been the root of it, but when the health scare absolved itself on its own with time, they went right back to their habits.

I've talked to them about this before and on some level they understand that they are significantly obese and that even if they weren't, the way they eat is awful for anyone, but they don't want to work on it because then they have to think about it. If it were up to them, they wouldn't do anything productive or good for them (bathe, practice hygiene, exercise, wake up during the day, work), we both have some mental health struggles so I understand where they're coming from and we've both had to push eachother to work on these things.

Im 165 cm, xx kg (a little more than normal range of BMI). I am currently on a keto diet (kind of). You see, my problem with diets are always the same. I start restricting myself and then I developed an unhealthy relationship with everything im not allowing myself to eat until i reach a breaking point and buy what im not supposed to eat. Eat it, and then purge. Just a few days ago. I was so hungry. I left work, bought stirfry noodles with peanut sauce ate the whole thing then made myself purge..

I am not happy, I am never happy on a diet. I must go on a diet, because I can't limit myself and end up gaining too much weight to the point where I dont feel comfortable and am on the verge of getting diabetes (which a lot of my family members have they also have high blood pressure).

I have tried to get help. But to no avail.. I feel like this is going to be a struggle for ever and I don't know if I can live like this.

I have struggled with underweight my whole life, I am in my early 20s and I only continue to slowly lose weight every year. I try so hard to gain it back but I find myself often repulsed by eating or just not having an appetite. I don’t think I am fat or ugly, I don’t think I have body image issues at all. I have had chronic digestive issues though, and I have lived with becoming nauseous very easily from my digestive issues. I have to take medication for normal digestive function as well.

Doctors I go to have never mentioned me having anorexia or an eating disorder, and advise me to eat high caloric snacks throughout the day. I prefer to eat alone and I make excuses to not eat in front of others because I fear becoming nauseous. I have an intense fear of vomiting although I have not vomited since I was a child. I know I have a bad relationship with food but I cannot tell if it is anorexia or something else entirely.

Everyone in my life has always been very concerned with if I eating disorder because I’m very thin. I always just thought that in the way that I deal with stress was I undereat. Some when they are stressed may eat a lot to cope, but I am the opposite. So, sometimes I’ll be hungry and go out to eat. I’ve always behaved weird when going out to eat. I’ll be hungry, and then the food will come out and I suddenly get turned off by the food (even if it looks good) and have difficulty eating it. I’ll always get a doggie bag to go, and I’ll leave it in the fridge and a day will pass and then it just goes to waste. And people get mad at me when I go out to eat and don’t eat enough. I always feel eyes on me to make sure I’m eating.

I never have counted calories, I do not make myself throw up, I don’t feel guilty. It’s just sometimes eating can feel daunting for me. Like a chore sometimes. I am very busy and i almost try to push off eating because I feel strapped for time a lot.

I think my main concern is that I lose my appetite when a large meal is prepared. But is this disordered eating? I always felt like I had a normal relationship with food. It’s not like I have a massive fear of gaining weight. I wish I was a little bit more curvy, but at the same time I kind of don’t want to get big.

And then people will tell me I have an eating disorder, and that “you just don’t know it”. It makes me upset because I don’t know what the truth is. I will say sometimes others can help give direction at times, but this is something I’ve experienced for a very long time. I don’t know what to do. I grew up with people making fun of me or embarrassing me for being thin and saying I’m “bulimic” and I have never, ever done that. I’ve gotten a lot of comments on my body by friends, partners, and family. It makes me feel gross.

What do I do? Does anyone have advice for how to deal with this? I’m genuinely trying to understand why I get turned off or nauseous around food. It’s like I will take a few bites, feel nauseous and stop. Or feeling very bloated. But it isn’t something emotional I think? I don’t feel “fat” or “gross”.

My sister just said she won't eat today because she wants to get skinnier

I'm 20, and she's 12. My eating disorder started that way at 12, I thought I wouldn't eat for a day, after that, I haven't lived a day obsessing over food.

My mom, who probably has some form of Ed herself, talks often about losing weight. My sister is a bit chubby, however not overweight. My mom says that my sister, me and her all need to lose a bit of weight, even though my mom is skinny. On the other hand, I'm overweight. I messed myself up so bad that losing any weight is extremely hard.

I constantly think about food and any little things trigger me. I don't want my sister to suffer the same way I did. I tried talking to my mom, tried telling her not to tell my sister to lose weight, but she said that she thinks it's good if my sister starts thinking about weight, and being healthy.

I think that it's my mom's responsibility, as a parent to adjust my sisters diet, and not tell her she's fat. It breaks my heart. When I was 12, my mom told me that I was obese, and I believed her. I wasn't. I recently looked back at my old pictures and I was a normal kid. Not even necessarily fat.

I think she tries to ignore that time when I had anorexia and wouldn't eat for weeks straight, and at one point I couldn't even eat anymore, my doctor said that I would be hospitalised if I lose 4 more pounds. She never talked to me about that after I gained weight back, like it never happened, like I was always fat and disgusting and lazy bitch.

basically i just moved away from my friends which isn’t great and  caused a lot of stress, i never really ate a lot before but i still had  the basic 2-3 meals. now i don’t even have that much, only some drinks  and a snack. i used to think it’s cause i was just stressed and i’d get  back to normal eventually but i haven’t. the real problem started when i  tried to get my eating back to normal but i just couldn’t, i’d feel so  guilty when ever i tried to eat a decent meal ,, so i just wouldn’t.  it’s never got to regular purging and it’s not like food is the only  thing i can ever think about so i don’t know if it’s an actual  disorder??? or just “disordered eating” because of a shitty situation  that spiralled out of control. i’m really scared that one day it’ll get  seriously bad and ruin my life and i won’t be able to do anything about  it.

My name is Elyse O’Loghlen, and I am a PhD candidate at Swinburne  University in Melbourne, Australia. We are seeking to recruit  participants for an online survey who are over the age of 18 years, and  who are currently experiencing difficulties with overeating, emotional  eating, or binge eating.

[https://swinuw.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6hztnk5hnXfyhJs](https://swinuw.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6hztnk5hnXfyhJs)

This research project aims to develop a motives for binge eating  scale. This study is also exploring factors that may increase the risk  of binge eating. Specifically, this study examines the relationships  between negative childhood experiences (e.g., emotional abuse or  invalidation), shame, self-compassion, and motives for binge eating.

It is hoped that the results of this research will inform  preventative and treatment strategies for individuals experiencing binge  eating. The survey will take approximately 70 minutes to complete.  Participation in this survey is voluntary, no identifiable information  will be collected, and all responses will remain anonymous, except for  those participants who choose to provide their contact details at the  end of the survey for the purpose of follow-up interviews, in which case  information will remain private and only accessible to the student  investigator, co-investigator, and principal investigator.

As a token of appreciation for your time and for sharing your  experience, participants who enter their details at the end of the  survey will go into a raffle to win 1 of 10 Amazon e-Gift cards valued  at AUD$100.

It would also be greatly appreciated if you could forward this  advertisement or survey link to any friends, colleagues, or family  members who are currently experiencing difficulties with binge eating,  as I am hoping to reach as many people as possible. Thank you for your  time and assistance

It started a month or so ago- at least, that's when I began to notice that she'd lost a LOT of weight in an abnormally short period of time. Upon enquiring about her health, I realised that she hadn't been eating at all. Later, as I probed, I realised that she had been getting through her days on coffee and refusing to eat because ""food looks nauseating"".

She recently had issues with an irregular period as well, but they couldn't find any abnormalities in her physiological functioning as a cause. It is suspected to be a lack of nutrition, which leads me to believe that this issue may have been going on for longer than I thought it did.

I was a bit harsh, and might have overstepped because I was worried- I first tried to make her eat by asking her constantly about breakfast, lunch and dinner to make sure she didn't forget. I did not realise that this could be an eating disorder at first. I assumed she simply wasn't prioritising food enough and wanted her to take care of herself.

Later I realised that it was a lot more serious than that, and although I had tried not to, I was concerned that I was guilttripping her, which could do more harm than good. I apologised, and I don't ask aggressively about her food intake anymore- however, I feel like any efforts that she might have made when I did, have completely dropped now. She's been experiencing a cold feeling and dizziness at random times now. I'm quite worried.

My friend and I don't live in the same area anymore, so I feel a little less helpful than I could be, although we talk almost everyday. She's been in therapy for anxiety before, but her parents withdrew her a year or so ago. We don't know if they would be open to reconsideration since they're having issues with medical insurance right now. She recently started going on the pill for period correction, but it had a negative effect so they stopped her.

I know I shouldn't use Google as a diagnosis tool, but her symptoms seem to closely match that of Avoidant Food Intake Disorder. She complains that eating food makes her want to puke, and the thought of eating scares her abnormally. She's worried that eating food will make her feel sick, and she avoids eating because ""she's worried there'll be leftovers that she'll have to eat later"". Whenever she does eat, it seems to be tiny portions of random snacks that have no nutritional value- which probably increases the sick feeling.

Can someone give me tips on how to help her get into eating better and help her hold out until she can get therapy? Although she hasn't expressed much annoyance, I don't want to be overbearing- but her parents have given up on her eating breakfast and aren't aware that she isn't eating much else for the rest of the day.

I'm trying my best to emotionally support her, telling her that how she feels towards food isn't ridiculous in any way, and that her struggle is valid. I try to encourage her to eat in less aggressive ways, bringing up my lunch and trying to describe it in an appetizing way, etc etc. I might be doing it wrong though, so I'd really appreciate some pointers on how I can support her.

I’ve been doing so well… I went to a treatment program two years ago and I felt “cured”. I felt like nothing could ever make me restrict or use any ED behaviors again. I thought I was free.

A few months ago I started birth control pills, to prevent pregnancy. For many reasons I am not comfortable with other methods of birth control, like the non hormonal iud for example. The pill is pretty commonly reported to cause weight gain. I went into it telling myself that it would be ok, I could handle any changes that happened, it was worth not getting pregnant, etc. I learned that the hormones really just make you hungrier, they don’t magically make you gain weight.

However, learning this fact has made me so untrusting of my hunger cues ever since I started. I’m not consciously restricting but it’s like every time I’m hungry outside of a meal I just ignore it because I blame it on the pill and not my actual hunger. I don’t measure food anymore but I feel I have been eating less, but telling myself it’s not ED related. “Oh it’s just stress” “oh it’s the nausea from the pill” etc.

I don’t really body check anymore but I do own a mirror, and I wear clothes (lol). I don’t want to mention anything specific but now I’m noticing that little body checks I would have done a few years ago would make me very pleased, if I were to engage in them today. I don’t own a scale but it seems I’m losing weight pretty quickly again. I know I need to just force myself to eat despite the nausea, despite the stress, despite the fear of the birth control making me “too hungry”… but something in me is scared.

I'll start by saying I'm already in contact with a therapist's office and waiting for them to get back to me once my insurance is processed. It's been two days now, so I'm going to call them tomorrow, because I think this might be the beginning of something I need to catch early.

I've always had body-image issues. I grew up with a father that made comments on my weight very often, even though I was never overweight as a child. I'm in my early twenties now, and overweight, and every time I come home, he comments in some way. Usually it's a comment on when/how much I'm eating. A few years ago, when I was a teenager, I started restricting under the recommended minimum. I stopped because I was recovering from an alcohol addiction and wanted to be honest about every aspect of my life. I've tried to lose weight more times than I count, and every time it ends in me giving up on the calorie counting and binging, sometimes for long periods, which has contributed to my weight gain. I'm told by my friends and men that ""it suits me"" and that they don't think I need to lose weight, but I cannot stop equating ""skinny"" with ""pretty."" But, more than that, now that I think about it. Worthy.

So, it started with that cycle again, just me deciding to count calories, but within the recommended range. And then I saw a pro-ED Tiktok, and then I sought out that kind of content, and started restricting far too much again. I've had physical symptoms now and it's scaring me. The thing that's scaring me the most is that I have tried to stop, and I can't. Now, the thought of food honestly fills me with dread. It truly feels easier to just be hungry than eat. I have done well these past two days, meeting the recommended minimum. I have a friend that's been checking in with me. The weird thing that's helped with it is intermittent fasting. It's like if I tell myself, ""Okay, you have to eat, and you have to eat enough, but only in this 8 hour period,"" it's doable, at least for now. But I'm terrified of what I might lower myself to tomorrow.

So I finally called a therapist. The thing is, I'm really afraid to be honest with her. I'm graduating college in a year, and it's been rough ride for me. I've been hospitalized for depression several times, and although I'm grateful that those inpatient stays saved my life, they did disrupt my life, especially my academic life. I can't bear the thought of losing what I've worked so hard for (to clarify, I'm taking classes right now to graduate on time). If I tell her how low I've been restricting (I'm trying not to use numbers, and I'm sorry if I'm getting too specific with what I have said), I'm afraid that she'll IVC me. I'm not underweight, again, I'm actually a good bit overweight, and I can't see any emergent symptoms right now - I also am not having any suicidal ideations.

I'm sorry, because I think I'm partially coming here for validation. I feel like I can't have an eating disorder because I'm overweight. I know if I were to tell my family, they would tell me that I'm ruining everything I've almost lost before, and the thing that kills me is I KNOW I am. I know why I shouldn't be doing this, and I'm still doing it. I ate enough today and yesterday, but I'm still spending so much time on those sites. And I still feel pretty when I'm hungry while I'm fasting. This is something, much like alcohol (which I haven't consumed in three years), I just don't think I know how to fix on my own. If I'm told that she probably will commit me, honestly, that's fine. I'll go and I'll be honest anyway, because I have to be alive to graduate. I just would like to know what to expect. It's also good motivation, in a macabre way, to eat enough in the days leading up to meeting with her. Any suggestions people have that have worked for them to get themselves to eat are more than welcome. I want to eat, I do, I'm just afraid of it. I'm thinking of calling my best friend and asking if I could send her my calorie counts at the end of each day for accountability, but I don't know if that's crossing boundaries too much - I don't want to make someone else feel responsible for my safety. She's a sweetheart and I know she'd say yes but I don't want to be codependent with her. I'm just trying to think of ways to stay safe until I can get some help, and I don't know that fasting is the right way to do it. That could spiral, too.

Sorry, this has gone on forever.

TL;DR - I'm going to a therapist about restricting my intake too low and I'm afraid she'll IVC me. I'm asking for experience on getting yourself to eat when you're afraid to do so, and also wondering if fasting could put me in more danger even though it's helping right now.",Request: I'm afraid to see a therapist because I'm afraid I'll be committed,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/oc6tq1/request_im_afraid_to_see_a_therapist_because_im/,1625240929,02-07-21 4:48

I’m also distressing knowing that all of this anxiety hasn’t gotten me to stop eating like I want. It feels like every waking hour of my life is spent dealing with nagging thoughts about eating and hunger. I’m insatiable, and I’m now the biggest that I have ever been.

Nonetheless, I saw to my ED specialist today, and she wasn’t concerned about my weight or my eating. She specifically quashed my fear that I might be bingeing, so now I’m not sure how to deal with my appetite and changing body. All I want to do is go on a diet to lose weight, but everyone—from my doctor to my therapist to my girlfriend to my own inner voice—is telling me I shouldn’t do that.

Hello, my name is Winnie and I have been struggling with anorexia for a while.

Recently, I have made the decision to try and recover, although it has been extremely difficult without outside support to help me along the way. I'm making an effort to eat when I feel hungry, and to have foods that I want. Despite the anxiety and guilt, I try my absolute best to push through. I know that guilt isn't a useful emotion in this situation and it's not worth sitting on it.

However, I'm still having a lot of trouble about restricting myself. I feel like I'm not deserving of food as much as others. I see other people eat during recovery and I want to eat too, but I keep telling myself ""oh you can't do that, you're not underweight,"" or ""you're still trying to lose weight, you're not meant to be eating.""

Hey guys! I'm wondering if I've been exhibiting early signs of an eating disorder and if so, i want to curb it.

The main problem i have is that i am unable to lose weight at the moment. I've been gaining weight a lot recently for a couple of reasons.

1. Pandemic (i mean who hasn't had pandemic problems??)
2. I was cheated on (very bad depression. Was diagnosed with PTSD and find it hard to look in the mirror, much less appreciate my body and myself as a person)
3. I hurt my ankle very very bad and now have to go to physical therapy for it. Which means no exercise.

I am still at a healthy weight. But my jaw line is no longer defined, my tummy pushes out a bit more, etc. I can see that I'm gaining weight, but it's not something I'm freaking out about.

I don't want to wait until I'm so overweight I'm unable to walk out back, but at the same time, I'm struggling to even maintain my current weight because of the problems listed above.

I've always had an unhealthy relationship with food. But it was more of an ""i can eat whatever i want and not gain weight because i have a high metabolism"" and became ""i still eat as much as i want but my metabolism can no longer keep up with me""

Very recently i haven't been hungry. And I'm not saying that I've ignored my hunger, i have a hard time doing that. But i just physically haven't been hungry. I'll usually eat 3 meals and 2 snacks a day (for example) but recently it's been breakfast and a snack.

Today, i was hungry enough to eat 3 meals and 2 snacks. AND a desert. Great, right? But now I'm hungry again and wanting to deny myself food specifically because i felt like I've eaten too much today.

The PTSD issue (i hate calling it PTSD. I didn't go to war. But please don't come for me over it. It was a legitimate diagnosis), the lack of physical ability to work out, and the weird food flip I've done make me worried that I'm starting to develop some kind of eating disorder.

I (19f with autism) have had an eating disorder for about half a year- not sure how to label it, but I heavily restrict calories and am at a point where I no longer feel hungry and all food tastes bad to me… I can only manage a few bites of food I used to love because the taste is so sour in my mouth. I have also been finding whenever I eat I get bad stomach aches- not sure if that’s anxiety or if my body can’t handle food anymore.

My parents (who i still life with) are obsessive about food and have told me my whole life that I was too fat and need to eat less (I have never been overweight in my life, they just have an obsession with me being bone thin). Lately since I have lost a lot of weight they have been telling me I look good and are proud of me for losing weight. I have lightly tried to tell them that I have an eating disorder and it doesn’t help when they encourage it but I am always met with “we are just trying to make sure you’re healthy” and end up yelling at me and sometimes crying.

I am not in a position to get a job, so I cannot afford therapy, plus I don’t know how I’d get there since I don’t have a car and my parents can’t know I’m going to therapy. I am scared I am going to cause irreversible damage on my body and I don’t want to feel like this anymore. Does anyone know of free online Ed recovery or other tricks that helped them?

I'm trying to eat like a normal person but for some reason I can't stop eating cookies and cake during the day. Like, yesterday I ate half a pack of cookies and 1/4th of an homemade cake. I don't even restrict on those, I mean not more than any person with an healthy relationship with food. I'm anorexic and I'm either restricting or eating junk food throughout the day. I don't think I would qualify that as a binge tho, because I can stop (I feel very sh\*tty when I'm snacking and because I live alone, thinking about the money I'm wasting by eating usually helps me stop) but I may be wrong. Whenever I'm home doing nothing I just feel the urge to snack on cookies, cake, toast etc... probably because I'm bored and then I feel guilty and restrict when it's actual dinner time which probably doesn't help...

About 7 months ago, due to my doctors instructions, I had to overhaul my diet due to some health issues. Before I went on this diet I was in a healthy weight, leaning a bit towards heavier than my usual weight since I had stopped working out during the pandemic. My health issues have been a significant part of my life for the past 7 years, and the possibility of not having to deal with them as much is honestly both scary and something I’m really looking forward to.

I have made good progress so far, and my health issues have reduced considerably. However, I fear I may have gone too overboard with the health regiment. I am now edging closer and closer to underweight than I have ever in my life, and I find it difficult to let myself eat bigger portions or add things to my diet that I shouldn’t have often (even if I’m allowed to every now and then). I haven’t really given myself any “treats” or off days in months, and I am starting to get anxious when I gain weight or feel like I’m deviating from my diet instructions.

I’ve always had a very healthy relationship with food, and I feel like I’ve lost that a bit. Some days I don’t even really feel hungry and struggle to eat because I don’t really have as much joy when eating, it all just seems like a “necessary for survival” thing rather than anything else. Some days I don’t have that much energy to do things either, though I am trying to eat balanced and in big enough portions.

Has anyone gone through something like this and could tell me how they managed? I just think I’m having a hard time finding the middle ground. I don’t want to end up being too weight conscious (which I already am, if I’m being honest) or damaging my health this way when I’m supposed to be doing this to get better.

Hello,

I need some help. I have no official diagnosis yet but fall into BED (imo) and I am overweight. My Dr wants me to eat a particular diet which I have been trying to stick to since January but I fail. The longest I can stick to it is 12 days before I start to binge. How do I stop?

Also I am curious if it sounds like I have a disorder at all. I understand I would need to see a specialist someday for a diagnosis but would appreciate to hear if anyone else is like me. For me I can be not hungry for a long time and won't seem to struggle and then I get a sudden craving for a particular food and I almost eat nothing but that food for days on end until I get so sick of it and don't eat it for sometimes years. Sometimes foods I've never really eaten before or sometimes it is childhood comfort food. I've been like this for a very long time. I'll just eat it 4 or 5 times a day where as other days I can go most of the day not excessively peckish. I've been eating cheese and spring onion sandwiches for days on end and can't stop wanting them.

Looking for advice from anyone who has struggled with this. I grew up an athlete since 7 years old and competed through college, I did some marathons after college and eventually ended up with an autoimmune disease that forced me to the sidelines on occasion. I've struggled with over exercising and restricting/binging for many years. I had a good 5 years maybe that I actually stopped binge eating, even though I was exercising fairly heavily, I think because I was super strict with my diet as far as what I could eat basically meat, veggies and some fruit, I did this for my autoimmune disease but it really helped as far as not binging. I'm not a ""moderator"" as in, I find it pretty much impossible to eat just a little bit of certain things, they end up making me want more once I have them and I obsess over them (sugar in particular), so when I eliminated all of those triggers I didn't feel the urge to binge. I did eat a TON, but I finally felt good about my body composition and didn't feel crazy around food despite being fairly limited in what I was eating. It took my binge/restrict mindset away. I realize many people may disagree with this and think we all need to eat our trigger foods so we're not triggered by them anymore, but I've tried way too many times to do this and for me personally this doesn't work.

Enter Covid and a constant flare in my autoimmune disease, and staying at home I somehow thought I would just ""try other foods again"" to see if they made a difference in my disease. And now over a year later of back and forth binging/restricting/fasting over exercising, and I'm pretty much miserable right now.

I find that when I overdo it with my exercise, I get extremely hungry and stressed. It messes with my sleep, I wake up in the middle of the night and then can't get back to sleep which then makes me crave binge foods more. However I feel somewhat addicted to working out, I think part of it is the endorphins it gives me, and I also don't know what to do with myself when I don't work out. I have other interests, but I feel as if something is missing when I don't exercise. I believe that if I could take some time off, it would be easier to get a hold of my eating and get back on track. I just am having a really difficult time convincing myself to do it. I tell myself again and again that I need to take some time off or that I won't push myself so hard when I go to the gym, and then I completely over do it and it sets me up to want to binge.

I know I can stop binging since I've done it before and legitimately thought I was done with it, but I did a year and half of tracking calories and lost quite a bit of weight, which I didn't really need to, and now I recently lost weight due to some antibiotics I had to take but am having rebound eating from that. Every time I lose a good amount of weight my body goes into overdrive to make up for it eventually.

To people who have never dealt with binge eating, I know this will seem stupid, but it's a legitimate struggle. I want to be able to work out hard without having extreme hunger and stress which leads me to want to binge, but I think I need to find a way to moderate my exercise. Does anyone have any tips or dealt with as similar situation? I'm revisiting Brain Over Binge and Never Binge Again, and I know I just need to stop reinforcing the binging, but I feel like my over exercise is a large component to this.

I should say I'm trying to get back to the way of eating I was on when I was binge free but it has been insanely difficult I think because I'm still currently working from home and my structure is not there like it used to be.

Okay so im making this post on behalf of my beautiful amazing girlfriend because honestly im at a loss. I strongly suspect she has an ED but she wont get tested because you can be professionally discriminated against (lower salary) if you have things like that on your medical record here (were hoping to move away one day but thats not in the cards until after she finishes uni and we both have some monry behind us), so we dont know what it is or if she has one but i really suspect she does as she has alot of symptoms in common with my best friend and cousin who both have/had eating disorders / body dysmorphia.

So, her symptoms (idk if thats the right word sorry) as far as ive seen so far is that she gets nauseous almost every time she eats; she has to force herself to finish the last bite as in her words she feels as though doing that is what will make her nauseous (which is part of why i believe the nausea is caused psychologically rather than physically but idk); she really cant eat alot normally unless shes having a good food day / is in a good mood; and alot of the times when she finds a food she likes, shell have it a couple of times then says its bland / makes her nauseous.

I really dont know what to do as were long distance right now because of covid and shes staying with her mother whonis very negative about food in general, criticises her for not eating enough but then when she eats foods that her (vegetarian, pseudo health science (literally believes you can live off of sunlight and water)) mother doesnt approve of shes negative then too, so my girlfriends entire attitude around food is very poor and she has zero support at home.

Does anyone know what might be causing this? And/or how to combat some of these symptoms or get around them?

Honestly, I don't know if this counts. I'm sorry for wasting your time if it doesn't. Since around 12 or so years old, or 3-5 years ago (I have difficulty with time due to trauma), my mother has been digging into my self esteem. She'd grab my stomach to show how 'fat' I was, even though I was a healthy weight. She's shame me about my body, tell me my stretch marks were gross. I gained a chest and a butt, unfortunately. My mother used this as proof I was overweight. She's used the things I love and my insecurities to pressure me to lose weight. When I told her I had dysphoria and didn't like my chest she told me to lose weight. When I went to a wresting competition she tried to get me to lose weight so I could be in a lower weight class. When I joked about how weird knees are, she told me to lose weight so I ""wouldn't have that extra skin"". I was encouraged to lose weight in unhealthy ways. I lost too much weight too fast and all she said is ""it doesn't show."" I was told to eat less that xxxx calories a day (very low)), which lead to me crying. I've vomited to get food out of me once, and I'm scared I'll do it again. I can't go to my mother because she wouldn't believe me because I'm not thin. I even had lipoedema, a disease characterized by fat in the legs that is metabolically independent. I was muscular! Every time I try to recover or build up my self esteem she tears it down again.

Eating for pleasure: Predictors of hedonic hunger and its relationship to food addiction

Eligibility: 18+, currently residing in Australia and sufficiently proficient in English to complete a survey in the language

Hi, everyone!

I'm conducting research into hedonic hunger (eating for pleasure), which is a new and under-researched area. Full ethics approval obtained from my educational institution's research ethics committee (ACAP).

The study explores what its predictors might be and the nature of its relationship with food addiction. Regarding this relationship, it also explores any moderators and mediators.

I have a keen interest in the mechanisms behind eating disorders and would love to be able to recruit as many participants as possible to make my results more meaningful.

Results will be posted to the Facebook page I created for the research study, which can be found at the link.

Only 3 eligibility criteria (in brackets).

The survey is comprised of 99 questions and should take around 45-60min to complete.

The eligibility criteria are quite broad, so many might be eligible (if interested) to complete the survey, so any likes and shares would contribute to invaluable engagement and potential recruitment.

The link will take you to more information about the study and the researchers (including me).

Hi everyone,

I (25F) just want a safe space to talk. I feel a little lost. I hope this doesn't cause any triggers.

I've only started to accept the fact I don't have a healthy relationship to food the past maybe, year? *I fell into the false belief all these years that I wasn't a specific weight to be able to have a eating disorder*

I would binge eat a lot when I was 14 due to stress and living in a abusive household, I was the heaviest I had ever been. Then I started purging a lot when I was 16/17 because I wanted to lose weight after a break up, after awhile I got worried about my dental hygiene so I stopped. I thought this was a phase I was going through. I was wrong. I have been on a journey of self-love and healing for a few years now, but I've been on and off with smoking cigarettes (I also stopped abusing drugs and self-harming years ago) but my binge eating has slowly made its way back when I'm stressed/anxious/depressed, I'll eat too much too the point I'll throw up and then I will feel gulity and starve myself so I don't gain too much weight. I do try to eat healthy for a few days, but then I just get stressed and binge eat. The process starts again. Then I start smoking again (binge smoke for a few days) to stop my appetite. It's this constant battle. I do put on and lose weight very frequently, but not enough for it to ""look"" like I have a ED.

I got into a relationship a year ago and I've noticed I have been getting triggered a lot easier. My partner hates smoking and I agree because I dont want to be a smoker - but it's been hard to not smoke when I get triggered. My partner had a ex who had a ED and other mental health problems and I know this relationship affected him badly (emotionally abusive), so I don't want to tell him I have a ED. I've told him that the reason I smoke is because I eat junk food when I'm stressed out so I replace it with smoking instead sometimes. He's trying to be supportive of me quitting smoking but I haven't fully opened up to him about this side of me yet - and honestly I'm terrified to.

My triggers though...

I get triggered badly when I notice him looking at an attractive girl (he's not gawking, just a quick glare), when he likes photos of attractive girls, friends he has slept with or if I see him having a friendly conversation with a attractive girl while we're out. This stems from my own insecurities (I was sexually assaulted in my childhood and been cheated on in my last relationship). I don't want to control him. But these things really throw me off - I either binge eat or I lose my appetite completely. I get quiet, sometimes cry and skip dinner. It's hard to do this all away from him because we are currently travelling in a van. He gets worried about me and he tries to be there as best as he can, but I don't let him because I'm honestly still trying to process this and I have to deal with this on my own (No way I'm going to tell him my triggers, that will break his heart).

I've only opened up to my best friend about this recently and she's shocked because she knew I did purge in high school but thought I haven't had any issues since.

I don't want to assume a diagnosis but they're extremely underweight. Veins are bones are prominent. They're quiet and they're family hasnt seemed to have intervened that much (I contacted a family member to ask about they're progress. ) me and my two other friends have tried to be gentle and ask in different ways ""what's going on?"", “how you managing? We all care about you and are a lil worried."" We are trying our best not to make comments on they're appearance and to just be there to make him feel supported in general. However this isn't enough anymore. Me and my other friends are currently in discussions about what we can do but we have never been in this situation before and we don't want to overstep a boundary and ruin our relationship with him and his family. Also to add he is trans so he is dealing with body issues on a whole other level.

I started a new job two months ago and the area I’m in is heavily male dominated, there are only two women in a 25 people group, so I immediately started bonding with this other girl, it also helps that we’re from the same country so it’s easier to engage in a conversation with her as we speak the same language.

Until recently I didn't notice I've never eaten enough

&amp;#x200B;

I have to force myself to eat during the day, it feels like I could go days without eating and not be effected. It's rare I have hunger cues and have an appetite, it's often so low that the thought of eating makes me uncomfortable. If I do get hunger cues I often ignore them. I usually go without or force myself. I can't eat in public or around people in general because I either get regular anxiety that makes me feel sick or I avoid it because I'm worried about that happening.

Until night time rolls around... and I eat myself to sleep. This is where I get most of my ""nutrients"" - it's in quotes because it rarely stuff that's considered healthy. Sometimes I'll even wake up and eat to get myself back to sleep, even when I probably don't need to

I'm not obsessed with my weight and it's in a healthy range, but I do notice myself having body dysmorophia. I'm not sure what to do. I don't think I should stop binging at night because otherwise I wouldn't be getting near enough calories. It feels out of control (during the day I don't have control over not eating enough and at night with binging). I've been prescribed those ensure drinks and I often rely on those during the day. I've tried scheduling meal times, planning my meals, and more. With no luck.

It feels like my last option is to start counting calories using an app. It seems like it could keep me on track, it helps for me to have very specific goals because while I have ocpd and perfectionist tendencies that I often use to my advantage to reach goals, I also have adhd that makes it near impossible to track things if they're not clear, specific, and easy. For reference, most of my negative ocpd/perfectionist tendencies have to do with relationships, my dr says it's good I often use them to my advantage while also trying to correct the negative aspects

It was a little frustrating because I'd specified my reason for coming on the intake form (it's a service that matches you) in the HOPE that they would actually match me with someone who has any experience with this. I would have settled for someone at least having a basic understanding, as it is considered an eating disorder. We have another appointment in two weeks (I don't think I could sit through that more than this) and I'm going to spend that time looking into some reads a user posted in [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit).

2279,EDPostRequests,1626860658,oomku0,"Hello, I'm absolutely desperate right now and I have no idea what to do and if anything can help me. I'm 24M from the UK, and I've been a long time sufferer of anxiety. Throughout most of my life, I've been able to control it, but about 5 years ago, it came back in full force and completely devastated me. I went from studying and uni to never leaving my home and, sometimes even my room, and feeling completely anxious all of the time. After a few years, I managed to get it under control to a certain extent. I still wasn't leaving the house much, but I had routine and functioned at a basic level. Last year was probably the best year I've had recently. I started going out more. My life wasn't free from anxiety, but I felt its control waning and I could finally see a future for myself. This all ended a few months ago when seemingly out of nowhere, it came back again. At first is was a panic attack here, a panic attack there, but as the weeks and months progressed, a chipped away at me. I tried to fight it. I tried to maintain my progress that I'd worked so hard to obtain, but it was futile. I withdrew more and more, slowly limiting my life more and more, and now I'm in the worst state I've ever been in.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since my anxiety told hold fully 5 years ago, I've had a difficult relationship with food. My anxiety destroys my appetite and makes me feel incredibly nauseous (it almost feels like someone is sticking their fingers down my throat), but for the most part, I've managed to push through it, but now I can't even do that. I feel so bad almost all day. Constant nausea and anxiety. I feel completely detached from reality. Nothing feels real, so it feels impossible to ground myself in anything. I can't feel present because I don't know where I am. I feel like I'm stuck in a dream/nightmare state and I can't wake up. I know I need to eat and this just makes me more anxious and nauseous. I am really scared that I'm going insane and it's killing/going to kill me. Yesterday, I managed a banana, some peanuts, a small bowl of salad, a slice of bread and a cheese sandwich. Today, I've only managed a banana and a handful of nuts. This is about what I managed the other day when I had a really bad episode of hypoglycaemia, where I almost passed out. It felt like my insides were collapsing and is the worst I've ever felt in my life, and I'm still shaken by it and terrified of it happening again. The less I eat, the worse I feel, and the worse I feel, the less I eat. It feels endless. To make things even worse, we're experiencing a heatwave at the moment and I also have an ulcer on my uvula, which developed about a week ago, so eating has just felt like a herculean feat. It's painful and incredibly distressing, and it occupies my thoughts almost constantly. I've shrugged off labelling my eating problems as an eating disorder, as it's not associated with body image problems etc., but my eating and relationship with food is very disorder, so would it count?

&amp;#x200B;

It's not just food, but washing and brushing my teeth etc. has become a real challenge. My nausea is so bad that I can't physically talk to anyone either, as doing so makes me feel like I'm going to gag. I feel utterly trapped and know I need help, but I don't know what to do. I already take mirtazapine 30mg at night, which sometimes helps my appetite, and I was prescribed 2mg of Diazepam, which I've taken twice recently. It seemed to help a bit, but I'm terrified of the long term problems associated with it. Sorry for this barely coherent essay, but I'm completely lost right now.

Hi everyone! I got diagnosed with non-bulimic Purging Disorder last year, and at that time I was only purging about 2-3 times per week. I felt like I had things under control in all honesty, however something that I was still struggling with is the fact that I was not losing weight, at all because of the medication I am on. I find that this has led to me being extremely restrictive and when I do eat, I purge any meal I have nowadays. Given this, I am *still* overweight given my height.

I have tried to recover in the past (before I got to the point of struggling daily with this) by developing eating schedules, eating with others, eating in moderation but ultimately my anxiety about my weight and self-destructive body image returns me to the same spot.

I honestly do not know where to go from here. I feel like ED recovery is a mountain that I do not know how to climb up. I am also starting to get scared as I do not want this to be permanent and I am starting to have physical health problems because of it. My family is not supportive and a few members of my immediate family does not believe that I have an ED because I am overweight (even tho I have been diagnosed by two doctors).

I really really want to start a stable recovery before my health gets worse but as I have said I honestly don't know how to start and how to keep myself from relapsing with my ED.

My doctor prescribed me Prozac because this has been hard mentally and caused a lot of trouble with anxiety (I used to cope by being active, but now I can't be active). The medication is helping me a lot, but I also think this medication has caused me to completely lose my appetite. Like I have no hunger but I can feel my stomach rumble. If I don't force myself, I can go all day just eating a cracker or piece of fruit and then something small at dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been going on for a few weeks, and I have lost weight. My physical therapist is concerned because I need to be gaining muscle in my injured leg and starting weights soon, and not losing weight.

Before breaking my leg, I had really adopted a much more positive outlook on weight and nutrition. I went from being underweight and not strong to gaining weight through healthy eating and focusing on exercise and strength. Now I can't workout like I used to and it's been hard.

I used to struggle with disordered eating and would restrict myself a lot. I've gotten better and gained weight since then, but this lack of appetite and weight loss now is confusing and difficult. I feel horrible for saying this, but I sort of feel myself relapsing into old habits. Although I don't have an appetite right now, I am struggling to make myself eat even though I know I need to. I think part of me finally feels in control again by being able to restrict my food intake.

I'm obese after loosing a baby at 16 weeks last year and never shifting the baby weight and also after taking a multitude of antidepressants last year to try and feel some semblance of normal, most of them made me gain a ridiculous amount of weight on top of the weight I had already put on and I've lost control of my eating disorder once again.

As a teen I struggled with anorexia and bulimia and I suppose it would be covered under the blanket term 'eating disorder not otherwise specified' or 'EDNOS' for short. I'm 20 now and I've gone the other end with binge eating disorder and general emotional eating. I have never had a healthy relationship with food. I want to loose weight desperately because I'm sick of being large, I have issues with my knees, hips and ankles and always have and being overweight has only worsened that. My biggest issue is that exercising and calorie counting genuinely triggers me just thinking about it. In the past during attempts to loose weight I have fallen back into a pattern of exercising in secret, under eating and all my old tricks I don't care to include here. In fact it was emotional eating for 8 months then suddenly trying to cut out food entirely that made me balloon multiple dress sizes years ago that left me 'plus size' in the first place. I honestly went up about 3 dress sizes in a week and haven't gone down since I stayed consistent for years at that size fluctuating a little within it and now I've gone up a size again. It's made such a huge difference.

I'm just fed up because thinking about how skinny I was makes me want to vomit and it's a bad habit I want to cut from my life.

I’ve (16F) been suffering from an ED for about a year and a half now. This is a restrictive eating disorder, which I became aware of perhaps five months into having it. I have conflicting ‘diagnoses’ if they can be called that— my pediatrician thinks I have anorexia and my therapist thinks I have AFRID. I think I have orthorexia. What began as a desire for health devolved into a full-blown eating disorder. I was severely underweight and understood the health consequences but couldn’t bring myself to care. I was content with slowly losing myself.

My parents grew concerned. I was admitted for blood work and heart scans in April, and when the results came back showing deficiencies and abnormal heart activity, I had a private call with my doctor. This was the first time I admitted aloud that I had an eating disorder. I cried and lied but was honest enough to get some truth out. My doctor prescribed me fluoxetine, an antidepressant, based off of a twenty minute phone call. This unnerved me. I was scared of being reliant on medication and decided to hold off on taking it, to see how my mood would change on its own as recovery was forced on me (I was briefly hospitalized and am being closely monitored by my parents and pediatrician as my weight is restored).

Sometimes I feel okay now. My obsessive thoughts have lessened and I’ve been able to be somewhat candid in therapy. I don’t feel overwhelmed with guilt for eating much anymore, though I still restrict in some ways. Food is less of a fixation than it used to be, albeit a fixation still.

But I don’t feel much better. I am a creative person. I adore writing, reading, and drawing and gaming as a side hobby, but lately I’ve had no interest in it. No interest in anything. No hopes or aspirations for the future. No will to live, frankly. I know these are symptoms of depression. I’m wondering if I should give fluoxetine a try. My cousin was on antidepressants for some time, though, and, as is the nature of an ED, I’m scared of the weight gain they tend to cause as well as becoming reliant on medication.

I started using a calorie tracking app to get to a healthy weight, but I still have the desire to lose more weight because I think I would like how my body looks if I could lose more.

I’m now at a point where all that I think about is food/calories and exercise. I made an appointment with a dietician to talk about how many calories I should be eating a day, my weight, diet, etc. and they said they didn’t feel comfortable sharing a specific caloric number with me because they feel that I am exhibiting symptoms of disordered eating and did not want to exacerbate it. She recommended I speak with a colleague who specializes in eating disorders so I set up an appointment.

I am aware that I am engaging in patterns of disordered eating because I do not trust myself to eat without tracking everything on the app. I’m scared that it may have progressed to a disorder at this point given what the dietician told me today. She recommended I delete the calorie tracker from my phone but I cannot get myself to so that (I have tried in the past but can never go more than a few days before redownloading)

My partner and family are big eaters, and encourage me to eat more even when I don’t want to. I don’t know how/if I should talk to them about this. I feel so uncomfortable eating in social settings because I always end up eating more than I intended; I like eating alone because I feel more in control.

How can I express this to them? Or should I? I don’t know where to start.

I’m a 21 year old guy from the UK and from my early teenage years to late teenage years I suffered with a restrictive ED and was consistently very underweight. Through a series of significant events including a loved one becoming very ill, a death, meeting my partner and quitting smoking &amp; drugs my ED seemed to no longer be an issue in the latter half of 2019 and I gained a little bit of weight to put me on the lower end of a healthy weight . I wasn’t thrilled but it didn’t bother me like I know it would have before, anyway, 2020 was a shitshow of course with the lockdowns, I got put on Citalopram then sertraline and by early 2021 I entered the lower end of overweight. I wasn’t thrilled at this but the meds allowed me to not care. 

Fast forward to April 2021, im off the meds and suddenly it all hits me. I decided I wanted to lose it in a healthy way so fast forward to now, I’m back to the lower end of a healthy weight. Things should be great right ? Well not so much. As I wanted to get back to my pre-lockdown weight as fast as possible I’ve had a v strict routine, but I still felt like I was being healthy as it wasn’t as restrictive as when I was a teenager, however now it’s time to relax, eat more and just maintain my weight im finding it impossible. For the first time in 3 months I tried to eat food that wasn’t super plain or healthy and would make me exceed my daily allowance and I didn’t sleep and I stayed up all night panicking from the shame, im so anxious about the scale going up as I’ve been weighing myself everyday the past 3 months. I’m glad im back to a healthy weight but trying to now not eat in a deficit is triggering me like crazy, i also am not thrilled about the physical results, 3 months ago I couldn’t look in the mirror, I can look now which is an improvement but I’m not satisfied still, I look like how I looked before lockdown which was the goal originally but I don’t feel able to stop, i thought I just had a good discipline this past months and was motivated to be healthy but now I’m wondering if my old behaviours are creeping back .

2305,EDPostRequests,1627466197,ot6ska,"I just got put on an exchange meal plan by my dietician and I feel like trying to attempt recovery while still having to follow rigid food rules is so counterintuitive and requires me to spend just as much time thinking &amp; obsessing about food and limiting my food choices as restricting did. Like I am still having to measure my food and weigh my proteins, I have to essentially count macros to meet my exchange goals for every meal, I have to plan out everything in advance instead of just eating what feels/sounds good.

&amp;#x200B;

I was trying to plan a dinner to make for tonight and looking through recipes, and my meal plan calls for one fat exchange but nearly every recipe would require me to use probably more than a single tablespoon of oil, and I also wanted to make a sauce but that would also require more than one fat exchange. So I am having to choose between roasting my veggies with oil, being able to bake my tofu, or making a sauce for the dish. I could make a sauce and eat raw/steamed veggies and tofu, or cook the tofu and veggies but omit sauce and it would be dry and bland. I feel almost more limited and restricted than when I’m not following a meal plan, because at least I can eat what sounds good to me (but in smaller, controlled portions). Now I have to eat a large volume of bland food and nothing about my relationship to food changes other than the caloric intake. I am still having to view food in numerical terms, and instead of getting to enjoy my food I have to eat meals that are incoherent and still don’t feel like they resemble how normal people eat.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most exciting and motivating prospects of recovery for me was being able to have the freedom to cook without having to calculate every aspect of the meal and just making what sounds good, and this is not allowing me to do that. I get that there needs to be a system in place to ensure that I’m eating substantial enough portions and a balanced diet with a variety of foods but this just doesn’t feel helpful at all and I am still having to spend way too much mental energy thinking about food and feeling guilty that the things I want to eat don’t necessarily match the meal plan all the time. I feel like I’ll just end up eating the same meals every single day to avoid having to think so much about how to come up with different ways each day to fit all my exchanges at the times they’re supposed to be eaten. Has anyone had success with a different model of meal planning with their dietician? I feel so hopeless and trapped, this is the only available dietician in my area who has ED experience and this is honestly making me even less motivated to recover :(",Request: Exchange meal plans feel just as obsessive as restricting,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ot6ska/request_exchange_meal_plans_feel_just_as/,1627487797,28-07-21 4:56

2318,EDPostRequests,1627207644,or8y8z,"Hi guys, I have been wanting to compile this for a while now &amp; today felt right. 

Brief background, I was diagnosed with anorexia for 4 years, then binge-eating disorder for 1 year, and began attempting recovery in 2017 while struggling with flip-flopping to both sides of the spectrum. 7 years total of major depression and other related mental health issues prior to 2017. I am currently 20 years old. 2017: 

1. How to stop binge-eating?? First focused on awareness mid-bingeing that I wanted to stop. I realized I would go mentally numb and binge-eating was a coping mechanism for my stress. I wrote myself a letter the morning after a binge, describing every detail, telling future me why it didn't help, how awful my body felt, and that I could do better for myself. I still read this from time-to-time today. Discovered I felt like I was intrinsically-worthless, but did not yet make a connection that the false belief contributed to my binges. 

2. I always had a journal my entire life and realized I only ever journaled the negative things in my life. I made my first attempts at jotting down positive things as well. 2018: First time I went to therapy. Realized anorexia &amp; binge-eating both had to do with control. I turned to not eating to feel in control when everything else was crazy, and binged when life was too painful. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized several very important things that made this year a turning point: 

1. I allowed myself to be alone and feel pain alone. I previously used food to avoid facing my emotions. 

2. Food-focus was a coping mechanism. I brain-stormed on paper a list of 50+ other possible coping mechanisms for stress and picked a few that I loved: meditating, drinking sparkling water, reading, going for walks, taking hot showers, reaching out to a friend, working out. 

3. I learned it was important to give names to what I was avoiding: discovered that being sxually abused as a child was what triggered my initial disordered eating. I had refused to face it for years &amp; through professional help, finally began processing what happened to me, instead of avoiding it with food control or binges. I identified my disorder as something inside of me, not actually \~me\~. 

4. Facing a very invasive surgery (unrelated to my ed) I discovered the power of meditation with self-awareness and anxiety. The best way for me was to visualize that I was a tree &amp; my thoughts were the birds around it. I am not my thoughts. I am a being. First discovered the experience of being fully present, with short 5-minute meditations where I just allowed myself to be aware of all my thoughts, sitting cross-legged in a quiet room on the floor with my eyes closed. 

2019: Had a few relapses from challenging life events, but learned a lot. 

1. First learned how to forgive myself even if others were still hurting. 

2. Learned about boundaries in therapy. I either had stringent boundaries or very weak boundaries and almost nothing in-between. 

3. Began learning how to be more open about my issues &amp; chose people to confide in \*VERY critical to the next steps of healing in the next 2 years, although it seemed unrelated. This was the year I began to build my ""support group"". I had no one to confide in previously. 10/10 highly recommend first focus on finding 1 person you can trust with your journey. 

4. Learned about Guilt vs. Shame: my therapist recommended TED Talk ""Listening to Shame"" by Brene Brown on YouTube, it CHANGED my life. I realized I struggled with shame, not guilt, &amp; began to make distinctions between the two &amp; reframe how I felt about myself. 

2020: Huge accomplishment: Achieved my first 6 months at a healthy weight that I felt beautiful at, w/o fluctuating up &amp; down significantly! Really began developing a sense of when it's ok to eat &amp; when to stop. Had 1 more major relapse. 

1. I read the book ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"": just the 1st 2 chapters was enough to realize how deeply embedded our childhood is in all of us. HIGHLY recommend. Gave me further power over my deep pain &amp; ability to separate desire to eat/avoid eating with desire to not feel pain. Realized I could be in control if I wanted. 

2. Did a 30-day challenge called ""Beating Binge Eating"": learned a TON, highly recommend. For me specifically, learned I had a lot of bad habits with control. I not only controlled food, but tried to control everything else too. I attempted a more holistic approach, identified things (like my family) that I gave too much power to, &amp; began to focus more on me through ""self-care"". -Important Take-aways from this challenge: Even tho my over-eating was not as calorically large as it used to be, it was still compulsive and therefore a binge. I now label any compulsive eating as a binge, because naming it gives me power over it. I would often spend 20 minutes in Walmart picking the perfect calorie/flavor/type of ice cream &amp; realized I did this with a lot of foods, and ordering in restaurants. I gave myself a time limit to decide on food--because, after all, it's just food. Also made 2 new rules on my weekly food-shopping: (1) if I saw a food I liked 2 weeks in a row &amp; still wanted it, then I got it the 3rd time I saw it. (2) every week I bought myself at least 1 treat, no matter what. This allowed me to discover I could in fact have treats &amp; not binge on it, because I knew I would be getting more the next week no matter what, &amp; helped heal some scarcity mindset. 

3. Self-Care: Watched ""AlexandrasGirlyTalk"" Youtube video on How To Self Care. Applied it to my life: scheduled in showers, researched best soaps/makeup/ways to make myself feel good in ways other than food to decrease my stress. For the first time ever, dedicated a couple hours a week to relaxing, even if it felt selfish or like I should be doing other more ""important"" busy-work. Really learned how to connect with myself &amp; truly feel, cry, &amp; not be numb. 

. Attended EMDR therapy for my trauma&amp; began learning how to re-file everything. HIGHLY recommend therapy in general. By FAR the biggest contributor to my healing. I saw 5 total therapists in 2 years ranging from eating disorders, general therapy, and EMDR. It's OK if it takes a couple tries before you find one that you work well with. 

2021: I moved 1300 miles away from my hometown &amp; got a new clarity on what I want in life. 

1. I read the book ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fck"": Realized I cared too much about what my family/everyone thought of me. Fully accepted it’s OK to take a break from communication with toxic people &amp; am currently still on that break to connect with what I want. I had also assumed being a certain weight added value to my life. I was wrong. 

2. I read the reddit post ""How I Quit Binge Eating - A Guide For Those Who Struggle"": The phrase ""Bruh, it's just food"" stuck out to me. I’m learning to identify that the only thing a binge/over-eating does is satisfy the urge to binge. I gave it too much control/importance because of how I initially abused it as a child for a false sense of control. I will literally chant ""Bruh, it's just food"" in my head when I feel compulsive, &amp; most times I say it until my heartrate slows down, I believe it, &amp; I can simply move on with my day. Sometimes I fail (aka obsess over food for way longer than I like) &amp; that's OK too. 

3. Discovered I needed to Fail: one day I walked to the gym, stayed for 1 minute, &amp; walked back--shocked when I was in tears with sudden urges to binge &amp; couldn't get it together for a while. My whole life I told myself I can ""fail"" but never believed it &amp; always punished myself after without being aware of it. New way of thinking I am attempting now: If I don't want to do something, I will attempt it for 5 minutes and then stop if I still don't want to. Then actually allow myself to stop after 5 minutes without creating any consequences for myself. Still learning how to do this, but it’s incredibly freeing &amp; allows me to enjoy a large meal and move on with my amazing day. Or take a day off from a heavy lifting routine in the gym &amp; play videogames instead w/o beating myself up for being ""lazy"". 

4. New eating goal: I eat until my hunger signals go away, not eat until I am completely full for hours. Still learning to do this, but it leaves me free to eat enjoyable food when I want &amp; look forward to more later. 

5. Discovered I still struggled with feeling intrinsically worthless. To combat this, I began to put my worth in a higher power, Jesus. Yes this is specific to my religion, but my whole life I tried to get my worth from what I do for other people, &amp; how they perceive me. I realized this will always be lacking &amp; needed to choose something somewhat arbitrary for my mind to latch onto, something that will never change, so even if the people around me are not treating me well, I know I don’t need their validation to be allowed to live a full life. This has helped me ease desires of food coping mechanisms, &amp; instead believe I am not intrinsically dirty just by the fact that I exist &amp; am already loved by someone/something beyond us. 

I'd love to hear what others have used for combatting feelings like this too! I’ve tried everything I can think of, but this is the only thing that has truly impacted my life at its worst. Overall, I realized my eating disorders had almost nothing to do with food. It was the most convenient coping mechanism at the time, and there is nothing intrinsically wrong or dirty about me because I still obsessively think about food sometimes. There is SO much more to life than food. My journey needed a much more holistic approach than just focusing on food... so hope this helps someone else too. If you're at this point or beyond, what have you learned? How do you lose the desire to eat once you are full/move on with your day? Do you obsess sometimes still, or eventually it went away for you completely? Did you ever see a correlation between self-worth/food-focus &amp; what were your discoveries?","Request: A timeline of recovery, lessons learned, + Advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/or8y8z/request_a_timeline_of_recovery_lessons_learned/,1627229244,25-07-21 5:07

Eligibility: 18+, currently residing in Australia and sufficiently proficient in English to complete a survey in the language

&amp;#x200B;

Also, consider all the information provided at the start of the survey before commencement of the survey and decide for yourself whether doing the survey is right for you. The survey and questions were designed with ethics and care in mind but they do ask questions about eating behaviours, which is a sensitive topic- it's just the nature of the research.

Information About the Survey

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

This is a repost, as I don't have a lot of time to recruit participants, so I thought I'd repost this once to possibly reach more potential participants.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm conducting research into hedonic hunger (eating for pleasure), which is a new and under-researched area. Full ethics approval obtained from my educational institution's research ethics committee (Auatralian College of Applied Psychology).

&amp;#x200B;

The study explores what its predictors might be and the nature of its relationship with food addiction. Regarding this relationship, it also explores any moderators and mediators.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a keen interest in the mechanisms behind eating disorders and would love to be able to recruit as many participants as possible to make my results more meaningful. This is why your possible participation and/or sharing of the survey will be hugely helpful and much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Only 3 eligibility criteria, as specified above.

&amp;#x200B;

The survey is comprised of 99 questions and should take around 45-60min to complete.

&amp;#x200B;

The eligibility criteria are quite broad, so many might be eligible (if interested) to complete the survey, so any likes and shares would contribute to invaluable engagement and potential recruitment.

&amp;#x200B;

Future Results? Results will be posted to the Facebook page I created for the research study, which can be found at the survey link in the information at the beginning before the survey begins. I'll be sharing all findings once the research is complete at the end of this year.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll be able to see what your responses to and/or sharing of the survey have come to achieve. Even if you don't participate or share, feel free to keep an eye on the page if you're interested in the results. Facebook likes and follows are appreciated regardless of participation but you can also save the link if you don't wish to follow it directly.

&amp;#x200B;

Anonymity Guarantee I would like to reassure you that all responses will be kept 100% confidential. Even myself, as the researcher, wouldn't be able to discern between participant responses, so your privacy is guaranteed. The subreddit name will never be disclosed, either. I guarantee your anonymity.

&amp;#x200B;

No correspondence, including comments and private messages on Reddit or Facebook, will ever be disclosed. The research is done under tight supervision and with thorough ethics approval from my college.

My issue is that my GP strongly recommends I tell my parents, because currently they have no clue I've been going through this. I am terrified of telling them, because I feel like they're going to try help me but ultimately make things worse. This is exactly what happened when I was diagnosed with depression a couple years ago: their way of helping me was to belittle my issues e.g. ""you only have minor depression \[I didn't\], why are you acting so miserable?"" Or by reminding me of the damage I was causing my loved ones like saying ""you're selfish, cruel and tearing this family apart."" In the past I've confronted them about how what they said to me was really upsetting, but they always reply with how they were never taught what to do when their kid is depressed and ultimately never change how they speak to me. We have an extremely strained relationship, but I think they deserve to know what's happening. I just don't feel safe telling them whilst I'm living at home. My plan was to call them over the phone once I'd moved back to university, but at the same time I feel like the issue deserves a face to face conversation. They will probably find out one way or another, they already comment on how much weight I've lost, and that I never eat with them. At the moment they've just assumed I hate them and don't want to eat at meal times with them, and because I'm scared of telling them the truth I've let them believe that. I'm just terrified they're going to get upset and concerned, and proceed to try to force me to eat by yelling at me etc. which would just cause me unbelievable distress in a time when I'm already emotionally fragile.

I am a very picky eater, a word that I hate to use due to often being infantilized or used to refer to children despite being an adult with what seems to be a very serious issue. I have researched and while there seems to be an ED which may fit what i'm experiencing, my situation is not that extreme as the symptoms described in that ED, at least I don't think so.

I have what seems to be severe depression and body issues, I am not diagnosed hence it's not clear to me. I hate most food, be it taste or texture, and refuse to eat it no matter what. I can cook very little because I have no experience and am afraid to learn how to cook due to my living situation (unrelated).

I hate how I look, I always feel fat, and saying I hate myself is an understatement. Yet when I think it's all mostly because I am a ""picky eater"" it makes me feel disgusted. I feel like a child. I feel massive anxiety around food if it's not something simple like rice, plain pasta, or other basic foods like that. I cannot tolerate seafood, nor most greens. Seeing any spices on my food makes me spiral because I won't know what it is and the thought of it changing the taste or texture of the food disgusts me. It makes me feel rude whenever I order out and it makes me feel like I'm wasting food if someone else is cooking for me, and in both cases it feels like im wasting money, and it would be easier for me to shut up and starve. Growing up I was always judged and picked on, punished and shouted at for not eating certain foods.

So one of my best friends (33f) and I (25f) met through work. We both worked as program therapists in a residential ED facility. She’s an absolute amazing therapist and we worked very well together- especially during crisis situations. I always found it a bit interesting how much she made comments about the food when we would set up the cafe together, but nothing that was alarming. It wasn’t until months later and we had both joined different private practices, I realized she has an ED. She’s been able to tell me this confidentially, and says she’s aware it’s an issue and is working on it. I’ve noticed she goes to the gym every day for multiple hours and attributes this as her trauma reliever. However, she also talks about “safe” foods and doesn’t eat much. She’s honest with me about it, but also I know she doesn’t want me to worry, so she may be downplaying it. I know EDs thrive in secrecy. But I’m feeling incredibly stuck on how to support her. Based on the nature of how we met, we know all the typical coping skills and therapeutic responses but so I worry it’s not helpful for her. Any advice on how to support her/maybe get her help would be amazing!

For context: she is religious, believes in fate, astrology and fortune readings. She sees a life coach but that’s not scientifically-based stuff.

2333,EDPostRequests,1627983912,ox02cn,"So like the title suggests i am wondering if I have developed an Ed over the past couple of months or if I just think I have because even though a lot of my behaviours are questionable I still can’t fully believe it.If I have one I also want to find out what type I might have so I listed some of my behaviours below.

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with food has always been normal before,I’ve always been skinny and everyone else in my family is too so I never felt like I needed to worry about food or what I ate since I never gained anything anyways.Around January I started feeling like I wasn’t skinny enough yet and like I could lose a small amount of weight to be at this specific goal weight which I was obsessed with for no real [reason.It](https://reason.It) started small with me just cutting out snacks but over the past couple of months it has spiraled into:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Counting calories/weighing everything I eat

&amp;#x200B;

\-Doing 2-3 workouts a day and feeling fat/like iam gaining weight when I skip a day

&amp;#x200B;

\-intermittent fasting,having specific times for when I can eat

&amp;#x200B;

\-binge episodes

&amp;#x200B;

\-I have tried purging a couple of times but it didn’t work so I use lax tea after I binge/feel like I ate too much

&amp;#x200B;

\-cutting food in small pieces,eating out of small plates while using small utensils to make the food last longer -feeling extra safe when eating a lot of fruit and vegetables

&amp;#x200B;

\-getting angry/upset/scared when someone forces me to eat something I don’t want to eat or didn’t plan on eating/I have to eat at a family event and don’t know what’s in the food,iam hanging out with friends and seeing them get my trigger foods (fear of losing control and binging on said foods)

&amp;#x200B;

\-having a specific calorie limit and feeling terrible and like iam going to gain weight if I get over that limit -being scared of weighing myself -Having meals planned out in my head -when something bad happens I automatically think about starving myself

&amp;#x200B;

I only weighed myself this month because I had to before my wisdom teeth removal surgery and turns out iam underweight now which makes me oddly proud but at the same time I still can’t believe it because I feel like I don’t look that different and because nobody has told me I look skinnier yet (could be because I’ve always been skinny already but it still upsets me)I feel like I maybe have to loose a bit more because for some reason I really want people to tell me that they see a difference or even that I look unhealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

As for health issues I don’t have many,My hair isn’t falling out and I still have a period but have a random stomach issues sometimes but that’s it.

Hello all,

I have a problem I'm not sure how to handle. My friend has gained a lot of weight during the COVID-19 situation and wants to lose weight because they're overweight now and don't feel happy about the way they look. That's okay of course, but their attitude towards eating, losing weight and their self image lately has been worrying to me. They obsess over their intake and they're very insecure about their body. We both think they're going through a bad period mental health wise and they're projecting it on losing weight. Yesterday, they felt bad about something else and also felt like they had to much to eat, so they purged. This scared me shitless. They say they regret it and don't want to do it again and that they know where their behavior stems from, but I said that's what a lot of people think and say before developing an eating disorder. I recognize a lot of red flags in their behavior and I really want to help them and prevent the development of an eating disorder. What's something I could do to help push them in the right direction?

I have a history of disordered eating - was diagnosed  two years ago with anorexia by one therapist and atypical anorexia by  another therapist. I never followed through with therapy, but was able  to recover on my own (stopped calorie counting, restricting, and over  exercising in February of last year). My cardiologist wanted me to gain  weight since my low body fat percentage was affecting my heart, which  was a big reason why I decided to change what I was doing.

My husband and I became pregnant with our second child in December -  it was a challenging pregnancy with many complications. She was born  several months early and is finally home from the NICU. I am diagnosed  with severe postpartum depression and anxiety, which I’m sure a lot has  to do with the traumatic NICU experience. I started taking Lexapro a  week and a half ago, and am finally having some better periods of time. 

The issue is that I’m still not eating - I don’t get hungry (when my  stress is high I’m not hungry, it’s always been that way). But it’s  almost been a month since having my baby and she’s finally home and  healthy, yet I still can’t eat. The thought of eating when I’m not  hungry gives me anxiety. 

I have been in contact with the social worker and am waiting to hear  back from the psychiatrist, I just don’t know if this is just depression  or the eating disorder showing itself again. 

It’s weird because when I was restricting before I was always hungry,  but I wouldn’t let myself eat.

Several years ago my stepdaughter was admitted to the hospital almost in a coma because her mom had starved her over time. From what I gather, the mother was convinced they should only eat organic/non-gmo (which isn’t a bad thing ofc), but there are a lot of holes in the story. For one, the mom was underweight but relatively healthy. My stepdaughter weighed half what would have been appropriate.

Now she’s better, in terms of getting enough calories. Shes still in a skilled nursing facility because, while she’s out of the woods, her mom has bred distrust and apathy. The thinking is sort of ‘why bother doing for myself because I just always hurt and everyone is mad at me and I’ll just try to be very small so as not to bother…’ It’s problematic, but my goals are to bolster self esteem and confidence.

Anyway she’s at goal weight but someone suggested her skewed view of food and eating might mean she has an eating disorder(?)

This is new for me but I think counseling would help. I’m encouraging her to talk to someone (she has access but no desire). Beyond that, though, I’d like to find out what small things I can do to assist.

Is this an ED? Could her constant pain be a lasting effect? What other lasting effects could this have caused?

Does anyone know of any books or theories that may be helpful? Or if anyone has gone through this sort of Munchausen(by proxy)-esque forced/complicit starvation..?

I’m not really sure where to start, besides just being super patient and encouraging. I feel like I could do more to support her recovery.

When  I was 16 I obsessed with my weight and weighed myself multiple times a  day. If the number changed even a little I was immediately restricting  my already extremely restricted diet. My parents would always serve me  up a smaller portion of food compared to my brothers. I barely ate and  if I gained any weight my Mum would comment on me getting chubby, and  grab any belly fat that I had. For reference I was about 5'8 at the time  and weighed xx kgs (normal range). I thought I was fat. When my parents weren't looking  I would sneak into the pantry and binge on any and all 'bad' food I  could. I would eat the baking chocolate, biscuits, museli bars,  everything. My parents kept bells on their snack cupboard so we couldn't  help ourselves, it'd been this way since we were little and continued  until we moved out.  I eventually got a job in a supermarket and had  ready access to foods I wasn't 'allowed because they'd make me fat' so I  started bingeing at work, buying copious amounts of food at work and  stuffing my face on my breaks. I'd come home and hide food in my room.  This lead to massive weight gain and more and more comments my weight  and appearance. I thought I looked disgusting but couldn't stop.  Eventually things balanced out and I lost a lot of the extra weight  through reducing sugar and healthy eating along with exercise. But I  still saw myself as fat. Still couldn't see that I'd changed my body. 

Since then, I have a horrible relationship with my body and with  food. I struggle with body dysmorphia on the daily. Some days seeing  myself as so huge and disgusting I want to never look at myself again,  and others viewing myself as 'normal' but then not fitting into my  clothes size as they're suddenly too small. And so the cycle goes, round  and around. 

I hide food constantly, sneak snacks, binge on foods like I'll never  have it again, then buy more. I feel so ashamed tucking away bags of  m&amp;Ms or bars of chocolate but can't help it, I crave the sugar and  snacks and can't stop myself. 

I have had a baby, 11mo, and my body has changed again. Breastfeeding  has me starving 80% of the time and often I get so hungry there doesn't  feel like any time at all to make food so I reach for what is ready  available- which often means things that are higher in calories and  sugar. I am huge, the biggest I've ever been on the scale. I'm obsessed,  and most of the time hate the way I look. Each time I see a photo of  myself or see my reflection, all I see is the fat, the chin, my  stomach... I adore my stretch marks because they're a sign of my baby,  permanently carved into my body, but the weight that goes along with  it... I hide my body under baggy clothes... I don't know what to do. 

I don't have the energy to work out, I'm dealing with a broken bone  that is still causing pain 5 months later... Pain all over my body... 

So does this count? Is it bingeing? I've been gaslit a lot by my parents so don't trust myself  I think it is... I need help... What are the next steps? What do I do?

Last year my mum got fired from her job due to covid  and stopped eating, she was clearly depressed. She wouldn't feel the  need to eat at all.

I really didn't know how to help and started to  constantly tell her the importance of eating and then she is now saying  she is recovering - she says she gets hungry and now eats the meals but  still not that much food ( she has recovered 10 pounds at this time but  its still not the ideal ) what can I do, is she actually recovering?

I have dealt with an eating disorder as a form of self harm  (restricting and purging) for about two years. It was mostly unrelated  to weight as I was already underweight when it started. As time went on I  punished myself for being so underweight that I would continue to  starve myself. I've been recoved for about two years and have no real  triggers and I don't see myself at risk of relapse. That's not what this  is about, just background.

My boyfriend of a year now confessed to me in June that he believes  he has an eating disorder. His family has mocked his weight since he was  8 years old, forced him to go onto diets, etc. He still lives at home  and is constantly mocked for his weight and compared to his siblings.  But what baffles me is that he is not overweight. He would still be  perfect in my eyes if he was, I just don't understand where the comments  are coming from. I suppose he could be described as chubby but I  absolutely couldn't see him as overweight to any extreme amount. He has a  very distorted self image due to a lifetime of being mocked and shamed  by his family.

In June he told me that a few months before he'd started using a  calorie tracking app and it had spiraled out of control. He often eats  twice a day, at dinner and whatever he can find after midnight. It's  very obviously not enough as he's constantly feeling sick, bruising  easily, having memory issues and is exhausted most of the day. He's also  very depressed a lot of the time, sleeping about 14 hours a day,  isolating himself at times, etc. It hurts to watch him struggle and know  that there isn't anything I can really do. If he was anyone else I  would tell someone close to him that could help him, but I worry the  people he stays with would even encourage it.

He's self aware, knows it's harmful and says he just doesn't know how  to break the pattern. I offer advice (from my own experience and things  I read online) and support, compliment him on things unrelated to his  appearance unless comments on his body are welcomed. I'm doing  everything I can find to do and I know that he's been getting better  instead of worse, but it hurts so bad to watch him struggle in a similar  way I did.

He does see a therapist but he hasn't brought anything related to  this up.

Hi, I'm depressed and have been Having trouble with food which have caused me to lose quite a bit of weight.

I am never alone, and have come to the realisation that anyone even  being in the house deters me from eating. I have not eaten for more than  a week. I don't feel like I can ask my roommate to leave the house for  several hours, just so I might eat. I am a very slow eater, most likely  due to IBS, and a simple meal might take me an hour to consume. 

I have previously been a foodie, and always loved baking and cooking  so this is quite upsetting. I can't even get myself to use utensils, or  have anything that might smell and bother others.

I’ve told myself I would  never resort back to bulimia after I nearly choked on my own vomit, but  I’ve been binging a lot lately and it’s made me feel very worthless.  Since I was young I dealt with a lot of abuse and stress and food was my  only way to cope. I eventually found more productive activities like  drawing, writing, and skateboarding, but lately I’ve resorted back to  binge eating. It’s taking a huge hit to my self esteem and it feels like  an inescapable hole. I eat because I’m depressed, then I’m depressed  because I eat.

Hi, everyone!

Just reposting this one last time here as this community has been  hugely helpful in gathering responses. So many thanks. It's all hugely  appreciated. 

My research explores hedonic hunger, which is eating for pleasure,  which is why I included that in the title and not the term ""hedonic  hunger"". Hedonic hunger is a relatively novel (coined in just 2007) and  under-researched area.

Eligibility Requirements: a) must be 18 years old or older, b) must be proficient enough in English to complete a survey in the language  c) must reside in Australia.

You don't necessarily have to eat for pleasure to participate, thus is not an exclusion criterion.

Read the participant information before deciding if completing the  survey is right for you because despite me using questionnaires that  were carefully considered as to not cause much distress, most questions  do involve eating behaviours. You'll see the information on this once  you open the survey and read through the introduction. 

All interested and eligible are warmly welcome to participate in the survey. 

It's only comprised of 99 questions. The link will take you to all the information you need.

Link: [https://acap.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_eXNqmgqbkhFbTiS](https://acap.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eXNqmgqbkhFbTiS)

Responses will be used in composing my 12,000 word thesis for my  Bachelor of Psychological Sciencr Degree at the Australian College of  Applied Psychology. 

All of your responses will be kept totally confidential, I won't have  any way of telling them apart even as the researcher. No identifying  information is collected. I won't even know how you stumbled upon the  link (be it through a text message, Facebook group, Reddit post, etc.)  as the link is totally anonymous. 

I'll never reveal specific groups, subreddits or any other specific  details on where the survey has been posted. It'll only be briefly  mentioned in my method section that I used social media sites and I'll  list some general names that can't identify any as a participant  directly (eg. Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn, etc.)

I am under supervision of a highly experienced professor of  Psychological Sciences at my college. The research has also been fully  approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at ACAP (Approval No.  742250621)

Feel free to share the link around with anyone that might ne  interested, using any medium of communication. I'm hoping to gather as  many responses as possible to be able to find as much significant  information on the topic as possible.

Hi everyone, I'm currently in php at Monte Nido, but  their entire team is strongly encouraging me to step up to residential.   There's a spot open in their Chicago location that they'd like me to  take.  I don't disagree with their assessment because even though I  started php recently, I can already tell that it isn't the right level  of care for me.  I haven't made any progress with behaviors at all and I  don't find it as supportive as a php I went to previously at a  different center.  I also have a lot of trauma to work through, and  don't feel that there are enough chances to do that.

I'm really anxious though because I've never done residential before  and I have past trauma due to an unrelated inpatient admission.  So the  idea of being trapped out in a building somewhere makes me very nervous.   I also have a lot of medical problems that would need to be  accommodated, something that I've never had luck with at past treatment  centers (and am struggling with even in this php as well).

Hi there, (I had to break my submission into 2 messages to meet the character limit. This is Part 1 of 2 for 1 post) A friend asked me for some advice for her sister who is currently struggling with her relationship to food and her body. I compiled the following information to pass along to her and thought it might be of service to this subreddit. I hope it brings some insight!

Here is a post I shared on social media a few years ago to summarize my journey:

I debated sharing this post for a long time so please read with an open heart and mind. For years, I hated and was very concerned about my body size and shape. I went on restrictive diets, religiously counted calories and steps, compulsively over-exercised, measured everything I ate, always ordered ridiculous substitutions at restaurants, and would often binge while drinking, stressed, or starving in secret. Even at my lowest weight (nutrient deficient, bones visible, hair loss), I still hated my body and thought I could be thinner. From then on, I almost always felt fat. It is possible to have an extremely distorted self image. It took me years to hit “diet rock bottom” where I knew I needed help and have since been on my recovery journey. At first, I was terrified to let myself eat whatever I wanted. I thought I’d never stop eating and could never trust my body to know what it needed. Learning to intuitively eat is a process but it is so well worth the effort! Having stabilized my weight near my natural “set point”, I am no longer constantly starving, obsessing over food/calories/workouts, and I am so much more in tune with what my body truly needs. Diets and health culture teach us to lose touch with our body’s innate wisdom. Disordered eating comes in many forms as eating struggles and body dysmorphia affect most people (Some stats say &gt;70% of us have some form of disordered eating) yet we seldom talk about it. The aim of this post is to share my story in hopes of helping others reexamine their relationships to food and body. I know how painful food struggles and body dissatisfaction can be and am now a huge advocate for self acceptance and rebellion against the weight loss/fitness industry and beauty ideal. We are so much more than our bodies. If any of this resonates with you, I highly suggest looking into the Food Psych Podcast, the book Intuitive Eating by Tribole/Resch, cleansing your Instagram of accounts that make you feel bad about yourself, and starting a journaling practice. \~\~\~\~

Additional reflections on what I've learned over the last 4+ years in Recovery: We live in a society that normalizes disordered eating. I used to think that either you have an eating disorder (i.e full blown anorexia or bulimia) or you are normal. When in reality, disordered eating exists on a spectrum. SO SO SO so many women (and increasingly more men) have disordered relationships to food and their body. We learn it from our mothers, friends, and the culture at large. Many women, nutritionists, doctors, and athletes have become aware of the constructed set of beliefs, norms, and practices that is referred to as “diet culture”. Examples of diet culture are: the idea that certain foods are “bad or good” or “clean or dirty” or the classic “vacation calories don’t count” or “I better be running xx miles tomorrow after this meal”, etc. The guilt and shame that is associated with allowing oneself to eat is one of the major effects of diet culture. Diet culture can be easily seen in fitness and weight loss industries but is also sneakily hidden in the general health and wellness industry. It’s a tricky realm to navigate because obviously we care about our health, but adopting diet culture’s norms and the “diet mentality” is ultimately detrimental to our health, even if it looks like making healthy choices in the short term. (More on this later.)

In order to heal from my own journey of disordered eating, chronic dieting, compulsive over exercising, and loathing my body, I dove deep into understanding the physical and psychological underworkings of my experience. It led to a massive perspective shift and profound learning around our current society, social norms, our biological needs, true self care, holistic health, and more. I have read multiple books on the topic and have listened to hundreds of hours of podcast interviews and stories with dietitians, nutritionists, psychologists, research scientists, social activists, and people in larger bodies who have been through astoundingly painful weight loss attempts and abuse from doctors/practitioners. But most importantly, I’ve lived it. I first handedly experienced the process of going from chronically dieting and hating my body to intuitively choosing foods that feel supportive in each moment, eating for the purpose of satisfaction and self care, and trusting and loving my body more than I could have ever imagined. I can confidently say that today, approximately 4.5 years after deciding I didn’t want to live my life obsessing over food, body concerns, and exercise, my relationship to food and my body is SO different. I never thought it could be so easeful and fulfilling. There is so much to learn but I can try to distill down some core facets that have really served my recovery.

**Intuitive eating:**

* This has been the most important resource for healing my relationship to food. The concept of intuitive eating was coined by 2 dietitians, and is outlined in a seminal book: Intuitive Eating, [https://www.intuitiveeating.org/](https://www.intuitiveeating.org/), the newest addition is now out and I fully recommend the accompanying workbook - Intuitive eating is a direct response to the failure of dieting. Ultimately, you’ll learn in the book that statistically speaking, diets don't work. They may deliver short term weight loss but the majority of people regain the initial weight plus MORE weight. Numerous studies have found that in general, diets result in long term weight GAIN rather than loss. This is because the body is protecting itself from famine. It’s a biological instinct to hold onto nutrients when they are restricted.
* Intuitive eating is how our bodies were designed. It’s based around identifying hunger and fullness cues, feeling into our cravings, desires, satisfaction, and practicing attunement and acceptance. It’s a practice so there will be times when you feel like you made a mistake (i.e. overeat and it will hurt, under eat and get way too hungry and maybe overeat), but that is where the acceptance part comes in. Practice self compassion, move on and try better next time! You're completely unlearning old diet behaviors/rules and learning a whole new way of living and being in your body. It takes time but it gets easier and easier and ultimately you don't even really have to think about it, it becomes so natural. Also, Intuitive Eating is not a tool for weight loss nor is it the ""hunger and fullness diet"" where you only are ""allowed"" to eat when hungry. THERE ARE NO RULES in intuitive eating. It is a personal practice based on developing an intimate relationship with your body.
* Trust is key. It’s really scary to trust your body at first. Especially if you’ve been in the diet mentality for a long time. Trust gets easier the more you practice it. And it’s so worth it.
* Binge/Restrict cycling: This was a major lightbulb for me. I used to restrict foods physically (e.g. restricting # of calories/day or avoiding sugar). Physical restriction triggers a biological craving for what is restricted. It’s within our DNA to avoid famine as was advantageous for so many of our ancestors to survive. Our bodies are created to sustain themselves. A diet is nothing more than a simulated famine. When certain food groups or nutrients in general are restricted, the body responds with intense cravings that ultimately result in binging. Out of control eating that feels scary, wrong, and shameful. My binge sessions were often triggered by stress or being drunk. Following a binge episode, we often then are very ashamed and freaked out about the amount consumed. This often leads to further restriction and the cycle continues. I lived this cycle for years.
* We can also restrict foods mentally. It’s a little trickier to understand but mental restriction is when you are telling yourself you “shouldn't” or “can’t” eat certain foods. The “good vs bad” and “clean vs dirty” food labeling are examples of mental restriction. Even if you are not physically restricting by outwardly being on a diet, mental restriction also can trigger the primal binge response. Our bodies are smarter than our minds. It’s against our biology to be denied nutrients, pleasure, and the social bonding of certain food rituals such as birthday cake or thanksgiving dinner.
* There is also the “last supper mentality” which is when you are planning to go on a diet (such as a no sugar diet or all veggie cleanse) but you have some time before starting. It’s common that your cravings will be out of control as your body tries to get as much of that food group in as it can before being restricted.
* Other Intuitive eating resources: Christy Harrison's Intuitive Eating Fundamentals Course (here), Isabel Foxen Duke's Stop Fighting Food (here), or the Fuck It Diet (here).

 

**Joyful Movement:** 

I used to approach movement as “working out” or “exercise”. Constantly counting my calories, distance, pace, and progress. In healing your relationship to food and body, it’s often recommended to reconsider your movement choices. I stopped running and doing pilates for 3+ years since those types of movement did not feel supportive for my healing. Instead, I explored ways of moving that truly felt good in my body and I approached them with no expectations of caloric exertion, etc. - Yoga, rock climbing, nature walks, and tribal fusion belly dancing are all forms of movement that make me feel embodied, joyful, and mentally refreshed. My body feels celebrated instead of punished. I also approach movement intuitively, and never force myself to do any type or amount of movement that doesn’t feel like it will serve me. I embrace rest, especially on certain days of my monthly cycle, and I feel so much more in tune with my body's needs. - There have been challenging moments where life gets so busy that there is no/little time for joyful movement. These are times when my recovery is challenged and I get to deepen my practice of acceptance, trust, and letting go of expectations. Life is very cyclical and there will always be time to regularly move again. Time for movement is a privilege that so many people do not have. I’m so grateful when time allows for joyful movement but I do not punish myself or feel guilty when I do not have the time.

**Body Image:**  


* Health at Every Size:
   * Health at Every Size (HAES) is a newly emerging concept with substantial scientific evidence to support it. In short, it is the idea that one’s body size does not indicate one’s health. Or rather, that people in larger bodies can be completely healthy even if considered “overweight”. Or that thinner does not necessarily equal healthier. (This is not to say that all people in larger bodies are healthy). You can learn about HAES at the website (here).
* It's virtually impossible to live in western society without some form of body image struggles. Working on body image and reversing fat-phobia are KEY in healing. Whenever I have a body conscious/bad body image thought, I try to recognize it as a ""negative body image thought"" and respond with something like ""I am not my body"" or ""my body does not define me"" or ""my body is my vessel"" or ""the shape of my body does not matter"" or ""all bodies are worthy of love""... I’d recommend finding some little mantras that resonate with you. Try following fat-positive social media accounts (models, athletes, influencers, etc.) that are actively celebrating diverse body types and people in larger bodies. This will help with restructuring your mindset to be less fat-phobic.
* We live in a society/economy that glorifies a body type that only a small fraction of the female population naturally has. Capitalism media/marketing has insidious psychological tactics to make you hate your body and fear being ""fat"" in order to SELL YOU THINGS (diets, exercise products, beauty products, clothes, the list goes on)! They profit off of self hatred that they instill within us - It's truly evil. We must remember that ""modern"" times are only a glimpse of human history. Women in larger bodies have been worshiped for millennia by other cultures since they saw the full feminine form as a sign of fertility, beauty, and prosperity. Try to remember that we have all been subconsciously programmed by social construction, media, and marketing to fear the fat on our bodies. There is truly NOTHING wrong with your body no matter what size it is. Journaling down these reminders and self affirmations to encourage body acceptance will help restructure your mindset. It is totally possible to create new neural networks (brain connections = thought patterns) and overcome the root cause of your struggles!

&amp;#x200B;

**Self care practices:**  


* Healing from having a disordered relationship to food and body is so much more than just addressing the food and body relationship. There is almost always an underlying issue or set of issues that is driving the disordered behaviors. Yes, living in diet culture and fatphobia are main factors, but other factors contribute significantly. Some examples of underlying causes are: trauma (emotional, physical, etc.), unworthiness, low self esteem, perfectionism, needing to have control, escapism, self harm, etc.
* For me, my disordered eating was caused by low self esteem, unworthiness, perfectionism, and the need to have control. When life gets stressful and overwhelming, it’s an instinct to grasp for control of something. Controlling one's food and body is an accessible option. - Prioritizing self care practices that support us is key! Ways to healthily manage stress, overcome trauma, heal unworthiness wounds, and increase self love and self acceptance are CRUCIAL to healing the root causes. Joyful movement is one of these practices but others are: journaling, talk therapy, art therapy, women's circles, reading, dance, yoga, singing, sound healing, reiki, acupuncture, creativity (art, writing, etc). A book that is often recommended is the Artist's Way. One of the practices in the book is a 30 minute journaling session first thing in the morning. Stream of consciousness, brain dump on to paper. This was amazingly transformative for me. My writing sessions often consisted of me unpacking my stresses and body concerns, and reassuring myself with positive affirmations.
* So I highly recommend journaling! Journal your thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc. Practice self compassion, let yourself cry if you need to, and most of all FORGIVE yourself. We are not perfect and we are always learning. Forgiveness is huge. Explore other creativity, explore expression through dance, song, colors, cooking, whatever calls to you!

&amp;#x200B;

I started dating a guy a month ago. Back then, I felt in a more stable position and thought my eating behaviours were controlled (later realized it was just in my mind and I was actually starving myself while exercising to exhaustion). Since dating him, I felt some weird pressure that I'm not good enough and my self-esteem got even worse. He lets his emotions mostly inside and isn't really affectionate yet (rlly introverted). I'm okay with it, but because of that, I'm always second-guessing myself. I started binging and purging a lot and can't seem to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I reached out for help and I'm going to a psychologist in less than 2 months. I opened to him about it through text and texted him if he wants to rethink if dating me was a good idea, I would understand. He wants to stay in a relationship and also said it would be harder for me if we weren't together... after texting him how bad my situation is, he mentioned he wants to get more intimate, but since my ED is so bad, I have no idea what to do. He is so laid-back, that means I need to push this relationship forward because he wants to. Yet, I can't help but avoid calling him out because I gained weight while trying to recover by myself (ended horribly). I'm afraid of losing him too because I destroyed most of my other relationships because of avoidance, I'm really really lonely and alone at this point in life (will be even more without him)💀 Tysm for reading this far I appreciate it a lot ❤️",Request: ED and dating trouble,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/oz3i56/request_ed_and_dating_trouble/,1628264988,06-08-21 4:49

Sometimes I will wait until I am almost fainting to eat anything, and when I do, I struggle even just cooking or preparing something. I don't want to order in, I don't binge, I just don't want to eat and am not craving anything. My partner is worried because they literally have to make me food and pressure me to eat, and I know I have to make changes but I don't know how. It's not like I can't cook or eat healthy, is that I'm not motivated to, think it's a waste of time, and even when I have to eat I feel a strong rejection towards what I am eating (even if I like the taste).

2377,EDPostRequests,1629253312,p6i39e,"I have unhealthy body image issues, but only when I'm underweight. I would love to know if anyone can relate. I used to have some disordered eating patterns in my late teens (I'm currently 24). I've always been on the lower end of the healthy BMI range. I do fluctuate a bit, like most people do, but I'm usually comfortable in my body no matter what shape it's in. I don't really feel the need or desire to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

However, when I do happen to lose weight, as I recently unintentionally did, it sometimes triggers something in me. Whenever I reach or cross the threshold of being underweight, I become hyper-aware of my body. I look at the signs of being a tad too skinny (very visible collarbones, sternum slightly poking through, etc.). I don't think it's particularly attractive, but I'm not repulsed by it either; instead it's almost like I'm fascinated by it. Body-image wise, I know that if I were to gain the weight back and be within my typical range, I would feel perfectly fine, and I wouldn't think about it anymore - I'd be back to normal. I'd be happy to get some volume back in my chest, in fact. It's not even that big of difference in my weight or how my body looks, but just knowing I'm under the normal range is what triggers me. A part of me wants to stay this way. I think I like the idea of being ""tiny"", and maybe even of people expressing concern for me. I hate that mindset.

&amp;#x200B;

And I hate that I wasn't even actively trying to lose it, but now that I have, I need to be careful. The few times I noticed this in the past, I got out of it pretty easily. I have no issues with food anymore, and eat rather intuitively. But over the last few months, due to depression and medication, my appetite and interest in food are lower, so it's easier to think that my weight loss is ""inevitable"", and harder to get back to normal. I'm not restricting myself, but I'm also not putting in the effort to eat more.

Sometimes I go weeks without feeling hungry at all. Then that's usually followed by a constant and unsatisfiable feeling of hunger. Then it might return to normal, or just go back to not having an appetite. I know that the cycle sounds like a binge eating disorder but I don't feel the emotions of shame or guilt that are typically associated with BED. I just don't feel hungry at all or I feel very hungry all the time. Like my stomach doesn't rumble at all. Sometimes I eat anyway if I want the taste, but it doesn't feel like I need to eat.

It's killing me inside to look at myself and everyone has noticed my recent change in appearance. Another problem is due to me being nonbinary.

Hey all. Recently I walked in on my wife self purging. Since we have had some talk related to the ED, her, and my role in her recovery. Today, maybe 7 months after, somethings still seem odd/ off but I can't keep asking her all the time.

 1) she reports it's been some time since the last purge. But she does to the bath room during meals. Now, to me, it sounds like there is a very quick like burst of water that enters the toilet then 5 seconds later the sound of a woman peeing. I thought a pre pee poop, but it's all the time. Do people with ED purge that fast?

 2) pre bed habits- again the bathroom thing, then after a flush she stands by the toilet a little long (again like 10 seconds). Brushes teeth, then flossing like crazy. She will take a shot of backing soda. Drink some water, then make a baking soda water. She reports acid reflex. 

3) does this seem like behaviors of it being a daily thing? Is it that fast or if she's in the bathroom for 45 seconds I shouldn't worry? Are these eating disorder coaches a real thing? She listens to odd pod cast sometimes and they talk about body issues (maybe positive things but I have only heard negative). Then how can I help or ask? We've been trying for a year and half for a kid and we both are ""normal"" but I don't think she told Docs about a ED. Would it be an issue if it was every now and then or is it an issue because it's more often then she tells me?

Appreciate your thoughts sorry it's a lot. I'm just looking to see if I'm super crazy or not. I am trying to change my own thoughts on this so I may better trust her to tell me the whole truth.

Recently it’s gotten much worse and I’m not sure why… I basically eat a peach for breakfast, an apple for lunch, try to workout to “remove” the calories of what I ate. Then I have to eat dinner with my family and I can’t control what I eat so I eat enough to not make my parents worry but then after when I’m alone I try to throw it up. It hasn’t worked which is maybe for the better. But when vomiting doesn’t work I work out again.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s why I’m confused: there are moments where I feel almost like I’m fine, I don’t have to worry, and that I’m okay and I think maybe I can just snap out of it. It also hasn’t gone on for super long it just got really bad really quick. I’m not sure if maybe it’s a phase and I’ll be fine or it could get worse? My parents see me eating so I feel if I tell them I think something is wrong they won’t believe me because they see me “eating junk food like normal” I feel like I forced this on myself and I get so confused whether I really have a problem or not…",Request: Do I have and ED?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/p578ge/request_do_i_have_and_ed/,1629102891,15-08-21 21:34

&amp;#x200B;

It got better over the years, then worse, then better again. I’ve never truly “recovered”, just very high highs and very low lows. I spent my sophomore year starving myself, then my junior year is when I started purging.

&amp;#x200B;

It got so bad that I was vomiting blood and knew i needed to get help, but I couldn’t bring myself to confess why. My mother just thought I was very sick. Went to a gastroenterologist, got put on a few medications, I even ended up getting a damn endoscopy / colonoscopy. The whole time I knew that this was all for nothing and the guilt only fueled my disorder. At some point, the purging turned into another form of self harm.

&amp;#x200B;

I got better after that, and I’d been better for the past two years, but it’s back. It’s back and it’s worse than it’s ever been. I can’t eat anything without purging. Even if I plan on keeping food down, I panic and purge. The past two days I just haven’t eaten because I don’t want to purge.

I’m exhausted, I’m dizzy, my body is so heavy. I feel like I’m shutting down. I’m going to try eating some oatmeal after I write this.

TL;DR Sister is getting help in public hospital but her treatment seems too restrictive and we worry it's going to make things worse

&amp;#x200B;

My sister(19) has been purging for months and her weight is at an all time low, also starting to showing symptoms like muscle pain, teeth problems these few weeks. From what we know she's also diagnosed with anxiety but not delusional, is very smart and highly self aware of her problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Few days ago her counsellor advised her to be institutionalized, she agreed so we took her to a public hospital and she just got transferred to a mental unit yesterday, with her consent of course. By then all her personal items are taken away, which I understand. Problem is they also took away her books, which to me seems very innocuous. We were told that the psychiatrist won't be able to see her until a week later. She probably won't have a counsellor aside from drugs. Also visitors are not allowed, not because of covid, but it's just a rule.

&amp;#x200B;

It's great to have free healthcare here and I understand inpatient treatment comes with a lot of restrictions, the lack of doctors is a sad reality we have to accept, but the book thing seems too extreme to us. But if they're giving her all this free time and not doing anything special, why can't she at least read?

&amp;#x200B;

Is inpatient treatment supposed to be this restrictive? We're tempted to get her out of there however we can't afford private hospitals.

I’ve been living with restrictive eating for 30+ years, I have severe PTSD and moderate to severe depression plus now, a little postpartum (hormones and all) added in. I gained… well we don’t do numbers here so I’ll tell you I doubled in size during pregnancy because the second I found out I stopped restricting bc I was worried about the baby and woooow it went on fast.

I had my little princess 7 months ago- there were problems. She is ok and healthy and bouncy, I am still doing physical therapy and occupational therapy and speech. Getting better but not where I need to be yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I lost most of the baby weight within 4 months. Hubby pointed out he doesn’t want me to ever be sooooo small again as I got after our first child (I almost died from it). I spoke to my trauma therapist and most of my motivation actually came from wanting to set a better example for my daughter on what a good relationship with food and your own body can be. With his help, I started treatment for ED (now with new onset of binging and purging associated with a self destructive mindset that awakens during flashbacks or whenever I’m physically unable to do things).

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been slowly increasing intake with my team and doing all the feelings stuff etc. within 4 weeks of starting, I gained it ALL back and then some. I’m now well above a healthy BMI. I asked about it and whether I could start trying to slow the gain soon- I was told to love myself even if I get huge.

Idk what to do. My goals of losing the baby weight are being ignored, I don’t want to do it in a disordered way but I want to feel normal again.

&amp;#x200B;

So, first of all, I am 16 and male (trans). My weight is normal.

Ever since I was little, I would feel really uncomfortable with the thought of being overweight or overeating, to the point where I would cry because the thoughts wouldn't leave me alone. They'd come when I was around food, so in ""normal"" circumstances, or at completely random times. Sometimes I'd imagine people I know overeating/being overfed, and gaining a lot of weight - not on purpose, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, I have this same problem. I'm still getting sick from these thoughts and I generally avoid eating too much for that same reason.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started puberty, I also started gaining weight, which is normal, but I hated it. I loathed having fat rolls here and there, or a small double chin, or a stomach that wasn't unrealistically flat. Fot that reason, I started restricting my eating habits around two years ago. Skipping full meals doesn't work when I'm at home, so I just do that when I'm not - which is about once a week. I then skip lunch entirely and only eat a small dinner. Other than that, I try not to eat unhealthy snacks. I often realise how much I've eaten on a day and I then get angry at myself and start crying again. Reading about calories just makes me feel bad over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I really love cooking and baking, and during lockdown I used to bake a lot, but I rarely ever ate what I made, out of fear. Outside of that, I mostly stayed at home during that time, so I was even more concerned with my own weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also tried to work out. I'm sadly not a very disciplined person, so I rarely ever actually work out, but I really hate myself for this every night. My weight and the way my body looks just makes me cry and I am trying my best to change this.

Hello… I have been thinking about this for months now and I would really appreciate people’s opinions. I might seek professional help with it if people think it’s important. For reference, I am 19 and female.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve done some research, but of course what I have always known the most about is anorexia and bulimia, which I know I do not struggle with. I have not struggled with my body image aside from mild insecurities, and I have been wanting to gain weight for years. I have always been skinny to the point of getting comments/insults on it and people assuming that I am anorexic. In more recent years, I feel that I have the capability to gain weight but I simply find myself not eating enough. Last year, I blamed my weight loss on going to college and not liking the food provided, but this summer I have been home with good food at my disposal and I think I almost eat less. I feel like I’m not doing it on purpose, or that I have a good reason, I’m just not interested or don’t think about it. I am also noticeably getting full faster. I’m sure this is negatively affecting my health but I don’t know how to fix it. Plus, I’m about to move back on campus and I’m afraid I will continue getting progressively worse.

&amp;#x200B;

And it’s not like I don’t get hungry. Like both today and yesterday, I got hungry but I just didn’t eat. I ate one meal throughout the entire day and just ignored my hunger. Why would I do that?

2403,EDPostRequests,1629970748,pbw47y," 

I (26M) have been with my GF (26F) for almost two years now. When I met her, she was at a healthy weight, thin, but healthy.

I already knew that, a few years prior to us getting together, she was hospitalized for anorexia nervosa and low weight. She talked about it with normalcy, and it was clear she was better.

During the first few months, she ate normally, and aside from a few comments about her not being perfectly happy with her body, she was stable and mostly okay. 6 months in, she had her first real episode. She said that she was obese and that she wanted to lose X amount of weight. I discouraged it, tried to be supportive, but she was set on losing weight.

I guess at this point I have to talk about her family. Her parents are just terrible, unsupportive and judgmental. Her mother is manipulative and extremely toxic, and her father is a bigot. Their way of dealing with her being unwell is telling or forcing her to eat, calling her names, or lashing out at her.

The thing is, she cares more about what her parents have to say than anything in the world. She craves their approval (which they never give) and makes them a part of everything, knowing that they're going to make everything ten times worse.

She looked like she was getting better, but then she was diagnosed with lactose and fructose intolerance, on top of her celiac disease. This has just been devastating to her mental health and her struggle against anorexia. It started by her losing a bit of weight because her stomach hurts every time she eats, and then it spiraled out of control. To her, the weight she's lost is gone forever, not the consequence of an illness that needs to be corrected, but the start of a weight loss journey.

She's already at the point of being medically underweight, but that doesn't matter. She sets the goal of losing X amount of weight, promising that she will be happy with her body then, then she reaches that weight and moves the goalposts to an even lower weight. Recently she's said that she wants to be exactly at the weight where she's not going to be hospitalized, even though that's severely underweight by any metric.

Sometimes she weighs herself and tries to celebrate with me that she's lost weight. I don't know if that's her trying to manipulate me into enabling her or just an attention-seeking behaviour, but it always leads to her being disappointed and sad that I don't celebrate with her. I don't scold her or anything, I just mention that I wish she didn't put such an emphasis on her weight.

I also can't just try to keep her mind off her weight or weight loss in general. Anything and everything can be twisted to talk about her desire to weight less and her disgust with her body. Try to play a videogame? If the player's avatar can be customized, she will make the most underweight character possible, spending ages trying to ""get the proportions right"". Reading a book? Is any of the characters fat? What do they eat?

She also suffers from GAD and, I suspect, from depression, which she absolutely refuses to even consider. She doesn't enjoy any of her old hobbies, she can't finish books or series, she just browses TikTok endlessly. She used to love her job, now she dreads going back (she's on sick leave). I have to push her to text her best friend of ten years. This all screams ""depression"" to me, someone who has gotten better from depression myself.

She's extremely intelligent and a nurse, which allows her to hide her symptoms when she talks to her psychologist and psychiatrist. She convinces all of her healthcare providers that she's just suffering from anxiety.

I love her, and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. She's everything I could ask for in a woman, but I feel like that woman is slowly being replaced by her illness. I can count with one hand the times that we've had a genuinely good time that didn't involve sex in the last 6 months. I can't go for a walk with her, as not only she doesn't want to leave the house for anything other that driving to go grocery shopping or seeing her parents, but most she will get light-headed if she walks for five minutes.

Last year, during the pandemic, her mother was making her have an anxiety attack everyday, making her life miserable. Throwing her things away (including a gift from her late best friend, who committed suicide years ago), insulting her, shouting, and my GF even told me about an incident when her mother called her obese.

All of this led me to look for an place so we could live together and get her out of her parent's house. This has been at the expense of my own goals. I was studying to get a job that would grant me economical stability for the rest of my life, and I've put that on hold to get a job and pay rent. I've even been on sick leave myself because of migraines I think are associated with stress.

She refuses therapy or treatment on the basis that ""all therapists ask her the same things"". She found A therapist that she liked last year, and left because €70 an hour was ""too expensive"", a few months after buying a €1100 iPhone, and a few months before spending more than €1000 on an iPad, and I offered to help her pay for it despite barely making it paycheck to paycheck, and her father being loaded. Money isn't the issue, and when she feels that she works well with a therapist, she leaves. I know that's what her illness compels her to do, but I cannot help but feel like she doesn't want to get better, and will actively work against it.

Yesterday she said that she wants to have children because that would help her feel better about herself. First, even if I found that believable, which I don't, I think it's horrible to bring a baby into this world as some kind of therapy. Second, she freaks out when her period makes her look a tiny little bit bloated, and I'm genuinely terrified of how she will react to pregnancy.

I'm at my wits end. I know it is not my job to ""fix"" her, but I feel like she just wants me to enable her self-destructive habits and refuses to even make an effort to get better. I would jump in front of a train for her, but I've spent the last year trying to prevent her from jumping in front on a train herself, and I don't think I have it in me anymore. I don't know how to deal with this situation anymore.

Looking for advice on how to help my sister. A little overwhelmed with all the information.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister came to me last night and told me she'd been losing a lot of weight and she doesn't feel good, she doesn't feel healthy. She's losing natural body fat and muscle mass. She tried working out to help build body mass but the next day she was bed bound because she had burned calories and stuff during the work out that she doesn't have to burn.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me she will only eat so many calories in a day but most days will not eat. That if she eats something that is more calories than she has set limit to she won't eat for days after to make up for it. But then sometimes she will binge eat and then not eat anything for days after again and she feels really guilty when she binges and that's why she won't eat for days after.

&amp;#x200B;

This has started due to stress and money constraints. She lives on her own and doesn't make a lot of money.

&amp;#x200B;

She mostly eats vegetables and fruits and tofu. She's not a big meat eater.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked if she had done any research and she said she tried but it scared her. So I offered to look into it for her and provide her with information she is looking for.

I constantly do body checks, check my weight every morning and every night, and I'm scared to eat fast food for breakfast and lunch and skip breakfast while constantly feeling guilty for eating lunch when i can skip it so easily. Because of this, my mental health was been deteriorating FAST. I've become more moody and distanced with my family. I'm always fine and happy at school but the moment I go home my mood is instantly ruined. I also recently started cutting myself as well. I rarely ever did it beforehand but I'm doing it so much now.

Sometimes I'm okay to eat, but then directly after I eat I go into a full blown panic attack. Things like putting peppermint oil on my arms, or chewing peppermint gum, or drinking sparkling water after a meal have helped me stay level headed but it is not always working as it did before. Sometimes, I can't finish a meal because the panic attack starts during a meal. I need help and I dont know what to do. This is ruining my life and I feel like a prisoner in my own body.

In fact, my BMI still counts as normal. Basically, I never had any problems with being under/overweight but I always counted calories and felt bad about eating, especially when I binged a couple of times.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have been severely restricting my meals lately. I still eat every 4 to 5 hours because of gastritis (severe heartburn if I fast too often), but I'm still hungry 24/7. I used to do intermittent fasting and I loved doing that, but had to stop. Also I have been doing cardio everyday, not as a ""cheat way"" to eat more, but because I just want to speed up the process. Very low cal and cardio have nuked my weight in the last month.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the thing is that I absolutely hate not only my body, but also any sort of fat in me, especially the belly area. To me, I just think I'm in a super strict diet and took some inspiration from pro-anorexia communities. And probably because of this, I developed some very bad habits such as weighing multiple times a day and basically I just got addicted to seeing the numbers go down every single day. I know I know, just being in a community like this is wrong, but still.

Obviously I don't want to develop an ED, but I do plan on staying like this for a while until I think I'm skinny enough. My parents won't stop saying that I look too skinny already, and sometimes I lie to them about having eaten when in reality I didn't. Some of my friends also told me they are worried because of my appearance. One of them even suggested I could have anorexia, and at that time I was eating normally. I thought she was completely overreacting, but now I'm reconsidering that because of my current habits and goals. I just cannot see anything wrong with it, because I'm still very far from my goal, and it feels like they are all picking on me because they don't want me to be skinny for whatever reason. Sometimes I also have nightmares regarding binge eating. And last but not least, maybe I'm just doing this for attention? Tho I really only told about this to a single friend who wasn't very judgmental. Like with the same argument people use for self-harmers, which... is also something I did. I also used to starve sometimes for self-harm purposes, but I can't do it right now due to the mentioned gastritis, but I would if I could, so I had to switch my method.","Request: Is something wrong with me?

When I was 14, I started struggling a lot with my weight. It was all I could think about, and I started eating a lot less. I don't want to go into everything that happened during this time, but my behavior was definitely concerning. The only reason it didn't get worse was because of a traumatic event that occurred that made it hard to think about anything else. Obviously the thoughts and certain behaviors didn't completely go away, but it wasn't as much of a problem. I'm 17 now.

If I gain even a little bit of weight, I hate myself and immediately start eating less. I frequently think I weigh too much (I'm currently at a healthy weight), and have thoughts of restricting my eating daily. The only reason I haven't is because my energy decreases very quickly and I feel like I'm going to pass out, become extremely dizzy, and can hardly stand up if I go more than 4-5 hours without food, whether I'm hungry or not.

That's quite literally the only thing preventing me from eating less, and I hate it. I don't feel like any of my thoughts or feelings regarding my weight and food in general are serious enough because I don't have a choice but to eat every few hours, even if it's just a small snack, so I don't pass out.

It doesn't help that I can't eat a lot of things sometimes feeling nauseous. I hate this cycle of ""have to eat regularly so I don't pass out, but can hardly even eat anything without feeling nauseous, and hate myself for eating when I do.""

Basically, over the past week or so, I’ve been dehydrating myself—which is something I’ve done before, but usually I can talk myself out of it before it gets this bad. It’s been taking over my life and making it difficult for me to do anything else, as well as affecting me physically by making me very constipated (sorry for TMI), but for whatever reason I can’t stop. I don’t know how long this is going to last, and I’m worried I might eventually stop drinking water altogether and land myself in the hospital.

I’ve mostly been eating food like normal, though. The few times I skipped meals, it was because I was worried eating would make me thirsty and I’d end up drinking water, and I hated the thought of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m okay with my weight and body shape, so I know this isn’t related to a body image issue. Honestly, I think it’s just a really shitty grab for control. For whatever reason, I experience a lot of anxiety around peeing (I’m sorry, I know that doesn’t make sense but I just do lmao), and dehydrating limits my bathroom trips which is nice and also kinda why I started in the first place lmao. The problem is I know this could damage my body if I continue, but I can’t stop.

Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and twelve sessions of tDCS during six visits over two weeks. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home–no in-person visits are required.

Hi, my girlfriend is struggling with an ED and I really don’t know how to help her properly. I’ve done my research to better understand how an eating disorder works, what it does, what it feels like, and what it is. I know so much more than I did initially, but because of the distance between me and her I still don’t know what to do or say properly.

I understand I don’t have the power to fix this problem, I understand I can’t control how she eats or perceives herself, and I am not in control of her relapses. I encourage her to talk about how she feels and I try to be there to listen more than anything else. If she doesn’t want to talk about it or feels uncomfortable I let her know it’s okay and I change the subject. I let her know she is important and she matters, as well as her health.

I suggested to her a doctor or therapist but she doesn’t think her condition needs help. She doesn’t want to seek help or get better, and I understand I am not in control of that. It hurts my heart when she talks to me about her negative self image, and talks about getting worse. I feel really helpless in situations like this and I don’t know what to say that would help her.

&amp;#x200B;

Other the past few months, the obsession with food returned. I'd been dieting healthily for about a year and I was finally seeing results. One day, I drove out to the closest McDonald's as a quick snack before I headed home after work and ordered a cheeseburger... Something I haven't eaten in years.

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like that was my kryptonite. I didn't enjoy it one bit. But one visit a week turned into two... Turned into every other day... Turned into every day. More and more food every time, even when I'm not hungry.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't purge, and while I do feel the need to afterwards because I'm so full and know all my hard work losing weight properly is literally being undone, I can't bring myself to.

&amp;#x200B;

I hide the food I buy - I'll only go out and eat when I know there's no one at home so I can bring it back secretly and inhale it.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday was the first moment I realised how much I rely on being able to go out and sneak food like I am doing. I can't shrug the feeling that I need to do it. I felt sick yesterday, but still drove to get my now daily fix.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't how I felt with bulimia. I felt in control there. Here, I feel like I'm powerless to these urges and it's just making my unhealthy mentally and physically after all my hard work after my recovery.

I can't finish any meals either, it's so embarrassing trying to eat with people because they notice how little I eat. I'm not doing it to be skinny, but I instantly feel full when I start eating.

I really desperately want to lose weight, I know people say “love yourself!” But the problem is, I don’t feel like me anymore. I used to be so normal around food. So I want to change. I have tried intuitive eating many times, but for me it simply doesn’t work in terms of weight loss. I use it as an excuse to binge more, in fact. So I simply have to eat less in order to lose it. But for some reason, whenever I tell myself I have to eat less, it automatically makes me hungrier? It just shows that mindset (for me anyway) is strangely important. For example, I can do OMAD for days (then I’ll binge eventually) but can’t even last a day on calorie-counting because it feels too restrictive, even if I’m eating less on OMAD. Also, when I’m depressed (which is often), weight loss seems pointless and I prioritise the need for comfort (aka binging). Although it seems that I’ve tried everything; the rational recovery trick (imagining the urge to binge as the animal brain’s voice and dismissing it), hating myself into losing it, trying to love myself into it, trying to “forget food” altogether, trying to stay busy... it all ends the same way; with a binge. You could say that I’m not eating enough, which is why I want to binge, but I already eat around double other people in the house.

So my question is; what is a mindset that I haven’t tried, that may possibly get me to stop binge-eating, and finally stick to a diet? I’m tempted to try riding my bike like 2 hours every day so I can eat whatever I want, but I have a feeling that “whatever I want” may involve 10 banquet-sized meals?

Hi!

I've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder but I've been on and off restricting for years now. I had good months, bad ones but I've never needed help. Recently I had a really bad few months, it took very long and I was getting worried. Restricting never lasted so long before. I went to my doctor and he advised to visit a dietician but I'm still young and studying and do not have money for that. Instead I decided to let go of all my food rules. I started slow, including fear foods in my daily diet, but now I started binging. I did some research and I think it might be extreme hunger. I do not know it is possible for me to experience it. I can just eat and eat and eat until I'm so stuffed I've never been before and all I can do is think about my next meal. It takes an hour or so and I'm hungry again. I've tried to not give in, but I read that you should give in to this extreme hunger so I did for a week or so. Today alone I ate as much as I would in 2,5 days. I've gained some weight already (note: I've never been underweight and have always had a healthy weight) I feel fat, sick and I end up crying in my bed everyday because of how much I ate. I can't believe I'm still hungry after all I've eaten.

Is this extreme hunger or binging? And does anyone have any tips for recovering without any help?

She also cries during almost every meal and sometimes even collapses to the floor in hysterics. It’s really hard on me because at her core, I know she wants to get better.

2447,EDPostRequests,1630488446,pfqb5t,"Hi, I've struggled with eating issues for more than a year and recently decided to start gain weight with the help of therapists. I've been eating lots of pastries and sweets to gain weight. It's impossible for me gain by eating more regular food since I get sickeningly full if I try to do that. (Tbh I've been somewhat binging lately, but that's a topic for another day.)

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, I've always had trouble sleeping, although not to the point of insomnia. Ever since I started to eat more, I find it impossible to sleep at night. I have a fitness watch that tells me how much I sleep. Yesterday, I was really tired while lying on my bed but just could not fall asleep! I tried listening to sleep music. Whenever I successfully lower my heartrate, my heart starts beating really fast again. I also find that my mind is always running. I keep thinking about the bakery I like, how I pushed my friends away by dieting, and how I feel really alone in my dessert cravings (nobody seems to struggle with this). When I checked my watch: I got 1/4 the deep sleep I usually get.

&amp;#x200B;

Could this be a result from hormonal imbalance? When I tried to google insomnia after weight gain I get results for obesity. (I'm still on the lower side of a healthy BMI.) If this has any implications: I'm 16, female.

Hello all,

Raising awareness about eating disorders, body image concerns, and how to promote body acceptance is a difficult yet necessary topic of discussion. The majority of adolescent females struggle with insecurities related to their bodies and often do not have a supportive environment that reinforces acceptance and self-compassion; when compounded with societal beauty ideals, many girls are at an increased risk for unsafe eating behaviors and further distress surrounding their appearance. 

In hopes to combat and reduce body image concern, the Family Body Project (FBP) was developed. The FBP is an experimental body acceptance and eating disorder prevention program in Oregon delivered virtually in English and Spanish for female-identified adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 years-old and their caregivers. If you are considering participating, you will receive an initial 15-minute phone call to screen for eligibility. If you are eligible, we will schedule an hour-long assessment that examines body image concern. 

As this is an intervention study, eligible families will either be assigned to the control group or the intervention group. Participating families will be compensated for their time with gift cards, totaling $95 over the course of the study. Teen families living anywhere in Oregon are able to participate, so please share this if you believe you know a family, or families, to whom this may be of interest! 

Potential participants can email Dr. Deanna Linville at [linville@uoregon.edu](mailto:linville@uoregon.edu), or leave a confidential voicemail at her office number: 541-346-0921. Potential Spanish-speaking participants should contact Celeste at [cmenamor@uoregon.edu](mailto:cmenamor@uoregon.edu).",Program for female-identified adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 years-old and their caregivers in Oregon,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/peevwm/program_for_femaleidentified_adolescents_between/,1630338576,30-08-21 4:49

I don’t really know what’s going on with me. i have, for a very long time, have just been unable to eat. being near, smelling, even looking at food makes my stomach turn. i CAN eat, but it usually ends in discomfort and in the worst case, vomiting in the end. i’ve been to doctors who specialize in stomach issues and i’ve had tests done and there’s just nothing wrong with my stomach that the three different doctors i’ve gone to could find. but the pain is immense. what makes it all the more confusing for me is the fact that i have absolutely no body issues. i love my body. i treat my body the best i can. however, not being able to eat has taken a toll on my body. i have breathing problems and get winded very easily which started when the inability to eat began to get worse in 2019. i eat less than a meal a day right now and i feel sick very often. i get very cold to the point where i uncontrollably shiver and i sleep with a heating pad and typically in full winter pajamas and socks. even then, i find myself waking up freezing and sick. no liver, kidney, or gull blatter issues, they even put a little camera down into my stomach and found nothing! i don’t know if this really classifies as an eating disorder, but i do strongly believe my lack of food is a causing factor in the other problems. i can’t just “force myself to eat” because when i do, i typically end up losing the food that i’ve gained. i’ve even talked to my psychiatrist and therapist about it, as well as the staff in the psychiatric ward. this was when the additional problems were really coming into affect, and they said that they didn’t believe it was an eating disorder because it was unwilling and not forced. i just need advice to make my life easier. i’m in constant pain and can barely lift over 30 pounds anymore. i have a hard time working and sometimes even driving because of the pain. i’m lost and scared.",Request: I've been unable to eat,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pe5ka5/request_ive_been_unable_to_eat/,1630298714,29-08-21 17:45

I've long been suffering from a restrictive ED. I've been told by multiple professionals and resources that the only way for me to recover from my ED is first and foremost to 'stop restricting'. However, no one ever explained to me what that means in practice.

Because to me, right now, 'stop restricting' means just binging. There is NO amount, type or combination of food that ever satisfies me to the fullest extent. I always want to eat more. So anything other than ""eat forever"" is actually restriction.

I'm being followed by a therapist AND a dietitian but both of them no longer really know what to do with me because I'm never getting better and if anything I'm regressing. That's because on one hand the dietitian prescribed me a meal plan which, however balanced and carefully crafted it is, still feels like restriction to me - I have to eat 'normal portions' at certain times etc. - and on the other hand the therapist's been doing mental work with me that has been incredibly helpful to let me understand so many things about me and my personality and has made me progress so much in several aspects of my life, but has changed absolutely NOTHING about my ED behaviours.

Basically I follow this supposedly balanced, abundant and adequate meal plan for a while, maybe I gain some weight, but the meals never satisfy me and it feels like I'm restricting all the time, waiting for the next meal to come, always obsessing about food etc., so at some point I ditch the meal plan because if I have to restrict then I wanna do it on my own terms. So then after a while I just get fed up and I'm so ravenous that I actually do decide to 'stop restricting', so then I end up eating all the time and binge on thousands of calories, which then I promptly purge because I cannot stand the weight gain....blah blah blah, it's a very known common cycle.

I feel so lost and don't know what to do. I feel like I'll have to restrict my whole life because I cannot fathom ever being satisfied by a 'normal meal' ever again, yet I can't just binge my face off every single day. I'm not even underweight anymore like I used to so maybe I'm just broken. But the point is, all these people that say 'stop restricting' seem to actually mean 'stop restricting *below a normal amount of food*', they don't ACTUALLY mean 'stop restricting for real' and it's so frustrating.",Request: How can I 'stop restricting' without starting binging?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pe5hd1/request_how_can_i_stop_restricting_without/,1630298442,29-08-21 17:40

I've been in recovery for six years, but relapsed a few months ago. I've never been diagnosed or treated even though I had some pretty significant health impacts. I had three young children at the time, and was embarrassed of my eating disorder so I never sought help. I've managed pretty well until now. I honestly did not think I would ever be engaging in ED behaviors again, but after losing my mom last year, relationship issues, and my youngest having some pretty significant ongoing medical issues I started using it as a coping mechanism and it snowballed from there.

Every single part of me just wants this to quietly go away. The logical part of my brain is screaming at me. I'm in my 30's now, my oldest is 13 not 7, I feel like I've lost every reasonable part of me. I did this before on my own, but I'm really struggling right now. I don't think I want to give up my way of coping, but I recognize the damage I'm doing.

Anyways, we're back to the embarrassment/shame. I live in a small community, I have insurance but no primary physician because I've never been able to make an appointment for a checkup. I don't have a support network outside of the wonderful support system of therapists/teachers for my kiddos.

First of all sorry if what I'm about to say trivializes your real struggles in any way, I don't want to compare my experience to an actual disorder but I'm afraid I may be at the beginning of *something*

First of all, I'm a 29 year-old woman. I don't think any woman in our society has a completely healthy and happy relationship with food and her body but I don't think mine has been especially bad up to this point. I do have bouts of depression related to childhood trauma, and whenever an episode is about to come up I tend to be more uneasy in and critical of my body. I had one of those bouts of depression this summer and really lacked appetite for 2 months. I got better for a short while, started eating again and felt a little bad about getting back to the healthy weight I had been at previously.

Now I'm feeling myself slip into a bad place again, but it's a lot more body and food-focused than it's ever been. I somehow know that my brain is trying to distract me from the trauma and anxiety by dumping all of its attention on calories and the way my thighs look, but I also can't stop thinking about it. This morning I almost panicked in my kitchen at the thought of having some oatmeal. I've never had such a violet reaction at the thought of eating and I'm really worried.

I'm thinking of starting therapy and working through all of this with a professional but I'd like some advice, reassurance, first-hand experience, anything really that you may deem helpful.

2466,EDPostRequests,1631187529,pkw3cn,"Recently, I have been wondering if I have an eating disorder. Since  March, I lost a lot of weight without noticing, which started a spiral of working out and eating “right”.

&amp;#x200B;

I eat an average of xxx calories (very low) a day in one meal. Oftentimes much less, and a lot of times what I am taking in is from drinks, not food. I won’t touch soda or dessert at all, and I will obsessively monitor how many calories are in my food so I can decide how much of it I want to eat. Part of it is I’m only hungry for a little, but part of it is deliberate. I have panic attacks when I see how many calories are in restaurant dishes. I often order a small house salad and pick around the cheese and croutons and dress it in lemon juice and pepper or nothing at all. I absolutely will not eat if someone else is not, to the point of starving myself because my partner is not hungry, or whomever I’ve gone out to dinner with just wants to grab drinks.

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost even more weight, but it is considered overweight BMI apparently, so no doctor will believe that I have an eating disorder. I tried detailing how quickly I lost so much weight and my relationship with food, but since I’m overweight and actively dieting, doctors just keep telling me that’s the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I don’t have a problem- maybe it’s all fine. Most of the people in my life brush off my concerns because “everyone feels that way when they’re dieting”. But I don’t think they do. And if they do, I don’t know why anyone would do it. I spend all day obsessing about what and how much I ate and punishing myself if I miss my workout (I hurt my knee really badly pushing myself to keep running after injured it, for one.)

&amp;#x200B;

my mom, a woman in her mid 50s, barely eats a whole meal in a day.

&amp;#x200B;

she usually drinks a cup of coffee with milk in the morning, skips lunch or eats very little food, such as a yogurt cup or a sandwich, then she goes straight forward to dinner. sometimes, between lunch and dinner she has an aperitif.

&amp;#x200B;

to add a little bit of background, she doesn't feel good about her body while she's actually very skinny. she's often concerned about gaining weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to address this issue, but she told me that she just doesn't eat much because she doesn't feel very hungry. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a PhD student based at King's College London and am looking for participants to take part in a study I am running.

&amp;#x200B;

We are looking for research participants aged 18+ who have: - A current diagnosis of anorexia nervosa OR - A past diagnosis of anorexia nervosa and are recovered OR - A current diagnosis of bulimia nervosa OR - A current diagnosis of binge eating disorder - AND are based in the UK

&amp;#x200B;

The research involves two online study days. We are interested in these peoples’ ability to think about personal or autobiographical events in the past and future, and how this relates to other cognitive processes. You will complete some questionnaires before taking part in the study, and then two separate study days that take up to an hour each. These days will be scheduled to be 24 hours apart. Overall, taking part in this study will take approximately 2.5 hours. Once session two is completed, we will give a £20 gift voucher to each participant for their time in participating in the study.

&amp;#x200B;

Please contact me, Johanna Keeler, if you would like to ask any questions related to the study or if you would like to take part: Email: [johanna.keeler@kcl.ac.uk](mailto:johanna.keeler@kcl.ac.uk).

2473,EDPostRequests,1631093571,pk76ew,"Bit of back story; back in June I was hospitalized after a teacher at school had to get someone to pick me up because they were really concerned, and a a blood test revealed that my phosphate was dangerously low, alongside my potassium, iron and blood sugar... all that fun stuff. It was there that I was actually diagnosed with anorexia- I've denied (and continue to deny) that anything is wrong when literally everyone, myself included knows that, that most definitely isn't the case. After finally being discharged I was kinda forced into recovery... I know I sound ungrateful, I truly am so lucky to have so much support and love, but in all honesty I wish it would just stop. I hate the attention that it's brought to me, I hate that people are almost babying me now. It's like everyone around me is walking on eggshells, being EXTRA nice to the point that it's just ANNOYING. I feel like crap for SO MANY REASONS. Because I was hospitalized I automatically got a place in an ED service in my city, a place that is generally really difficult to get into. I appreciate my dietician and psychologist so, so much BUT- I'm taking a spot from someone who might actually want to recover, someone who isn't just going because that's what has to happen after a hospitalization. As horrible as it sounds (it is) I do not want to recover and I feel so guilty for even thinking this way. I'm lying even more than I did at the peak of my ED- I'm falsifying weigh ins, waiting until my parents aren't looking to dispose of food during meal times and I'm doing unholy things to purge. I'm so full of anger, towards everyone. Towards the people who care for me the most. I'm lashing out at my parents for simply caring, for wanting to just keep me alive, I'm holding a massive grudge towards my teachers for even caring despite knowing that they come from a good place. I can't keep doing this. If even with professional help, I can't seem to want to recover, why should I be taking that place from someone who actually wants to make a change? I'm beyond miserable, I've hit an all time low. I don't feel like I've got anyone to turn to, and all I've been doing is crying and wishing that everyone would just go away and let me do my own thing. I feel so incredibly selfish, I know how much this has hurt the people around me but I can't change, I've tried everything and it's done nothing but made me so, so sad.

But it's so hard to do this alone and it makes me sad that I'm the only one feeling this way among my friends. I don't know how to handle these emotions in a healthy way. Any advice?

I just moved to Korea where I'm gonna be living and working for 1 year+. I'd say I'm pretty much recovered these days but at the moment I'm finding it very difficult to eat properly/enough. In quarantine I lost a small amount of weight but I really can't afford to lose weight.

At home in the UK I was vegan - not for disordered reasons! There is loads of great vegan stuff available in the UK and I enjoyed eating all kinds of vegan junk food. But here in Korea everybody loves meat and fish, kbbq, fried chicken, bulgogi, etc. Even being vegetarian is barely a thing. Realistically don't think I can be fully vegan here cause there's so few options and I'm fairly picky, but the thought of breaking my ""moral code"" (sorry not trying to sound preachy just can't think of a better way to put it) upsets me. I've been vegan for 5 years, before that vegetarian for 3 so now I feel intensely guilty if I eat something non-vegan.

Also I'm finding it tough cause I'm living on my own for the first time in a few years and now that what I eat is totally up to me I find it quite overwhelming. Sometimes I end up skipping meals or only eating a snack because I just don't know what to have, or don't want to keep eating the same stuff over and over.

Anyway I'm not actively trying to restrict or anything just worried about slipping back into disordered habits. My being here is completely tied to my job so I really don't want to get sick and be forced to go back home. Sorry this was kind of rambly.

This is partly a response to a conversation I had with my roommate, who is plus-sized, and who expressed her frustration with the fact that she has never been able to directly address health concerns with a doctor without the doctor interrupting her concerns to discuss her weight.

Which struck me as odd, because I have been underweight for as long as I can remember, and yet no doctor has ever expressed concerns about it. And I'm not just slightly underweight either--I've always had a wide margin between me and what's considered ""normal"", to the extent that I worry about it.

I had a therapist who expressed concerns about my thought patterns regarding my weight. I've had friends who have repeatedly tried to hold interventions about my weight. But I always have to tell them: I'm not intentionally trying to lose weight, I just can't gain it.

I'm always, always cold. I swear sweaters in August. I passed out so frequently in college that I was famous for it. But even when I've gone to a doctor's and I swooned in the doctor's office and I hit the floor, in front of the nurse, the doctor still did not consider my underweight-ness a problem.

A large reason, I think, that my doctors have never brought up my weight is that I live with IBS, so I'm constantly sick and I don't have much of an appetite, digesting food can be painful, and my body doesn't absorb nutrients very well in the first place. So, whenever my weight comes up, doctors either praise me (which is probably not okay), give me the standard ""wish I had that problem"", or say that it's no problem because I'll gain weight ""eventually"". Some people just go, ""oh, get pregnant, that'll fix it"".

I feel like being underweight is one of those things that could be a risk factor for pregnancy complications so I think perhaps doctors should not recommend I do that.

My mother says I can't help it because I'm exactly like her. I inherited her intestinal distress, but my mom never eats. Never. I remember very few times in my childhood that my mother ate more than once a day. She would only ever prepare food if my father was home. And then she wouldn't eat it.

I work really hard to make myself eat. I buy foods that are easy to prepare, that are supposed to be healthy and make my intestines work. But it's still difficult to make myself interested in eating. I might go all day without bothering.

Sometimes, I'm told that my lack of interest in eating is just my depression and that the stomach upset is just my anxiety (it's definitely related). Also, whenever I express a concern about my weight, I am immediately asked about my sexual orientation. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive, because I do understand that LGBTQ+ communities are disproportionately affected by EDs, but my warning flags always go up when doctors seem a little too interested in my sexual orientation.

I've been told that being underweight is very unhealthy but I can't find much information about it. The second I search for it online, all I get are diet tips. Not helpful! The opposite of helpful! I also can't find anything about being underweight that isn't tied to eating disorders. Do they always go together?

Is it really that bad to be underweight if my weight is more or less stable? It won't change, no matter what I do. Am I stuck like this?","Request: I have never not been underweight, but none of my doctors have ever expressed concern",https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pif7et/request_i_have_never_not_been_underweight_but/,1630877576,05-09-21 10:32

TW: Laxative abuse.

I’m a 37-year-old woman who has been “recovered” from bulimia for about 20 years. I say “recovered” because while I’ve stopped the daily purging, I still occasionally fall back on ED behaviors. I’m fully aware of this and won’t lie to myself.

About 2 weeks ago, I was constipated. Stimulant laxatives are a MAJOR no-no for me. Even with my sporadic disordered eating, I will not touch them.

I stupidly convinced myself that a diet tea was a better alternative. “It’s made from plant extracts,” I told myself. How bad could it be?

Really bad. Really really bad. I drank too much - like I fucking should have known I would - and now my digestive system is wrecked.

It’s been a week since I last had the tea and my stomach is still hyper sensitive. Eating anything other than binding foods sends me running to the bathroom within an hour of my meal. I can’t eat while I’m working. I can’t eat before bed.

This is the first time I’m ever talking about any of this, like, ever, since I bury it in a deep and shameful part of my conscience, so I apologize if this is a bit of a vent. When I was in middle school (I am now a uni student), I was overweight. It wasn’t significant and I never had a problem with it — in fact, I never even noticed it. However, I was living with my very abusive mother who essentially bribed me to lose weight (I won’t get into specifics but by ‘lose weight’ I don’t mean a healthy amount). With a combination of her encouragement and mental abuse, I lost… a lot of weight really fast. I went from being a bit overweight to quite underweight. This was mostly all from just not eating. I honestly don’t remember it — it’s a blur, but even though I was never weight-conscious before this, I felt quite good afterwards. I never thought anything of it despite a few concerned comments from those who knew me.

I maintained my middle school weight for a while, occasionally gaining some and losing some, but generally staying in the same range. Over a year ago, shortly after the initial quarantine, I gained all of that weight back and then some without even really noticing. But there was one day I suddenly became aware of the feeling of my thighs rubbing against each other… and this completely set me off. I have not stopped thinking about it since. It has consumed me.

Now I am obsessed with weight. It is always on my mind no matter what I’m doing. I can’t stop comparing myself to everyone — I’ll compare myself to any random person on the street without being able to control my thoughts. I compare myself to my boyfriend and he’s significantly taller than me and a male, but I still do it. I can’t stop looking at photos of other people and old photos of myself. I can’t wear more than half of my clothes because they don’t fit in a very particular way. I don’t seem to have the restraint I did in middle school regarding food and I’ve been stuck in a miserable cycle of eating, despising myself for it and promising to stop, then caving in and eating again. I can’t stop obsessing over how appalling I feel in my own body and it’s made me extremely, extremely depressed and has become my number one preoccupation. This past year and a half has sent me into a downward spiral and after not losing weight due to my constant relapsing, I’ve started to abuse my ADHD medication.

I guess my question, as pathetic as it seems, is: could this be an eating disorder or am I just insecure? I understand not to seek actual medical advice on here but am extremely reluctant to approach a doctor with these problems as I can hardly write them down, let alone say them out loud. What do I do?

For context, I am 19F living with my mum, with 2 older sisters, a younger brother and a younger sister. My mum does the grocery shopping, although me and my older sisters do pay some rent, and the four of us take turns making dinner.

On a couple of nights in a row, I found myself not particularly hungry during dinner and about halfway into my food I would feel full and slightly sick. I was sad because these were meals that I really enjoyed and made me feel really guilty about wasting my food. I started to avoid eating during the day so that I would be hungry for dinner and not waste the meal someone made for me.

At the same time, I also started feeling very depressed due to COVID lockdowns in my area and found a lot of my favourite snacks didn't taste good anymore so I eat a lot less than I did a couple of months ago. I never really eating a proper breakfast or lunch either but that is more about laziness over not wanting to prepare something for myself.

Do I have a problem? I always assumed that eating disorders were rooted more in body image or self-esteem so I don't know if what I'm experiencing should warrant concern.

I'll start by repeating that I cannot afford to see a doctor until I  have insurance (10/26). I am currently supporting myself and my fiancee  (disabled, absolutely cannot work) on $15/hr working full time at a  well-known big box store.

MtF transgender (technically fluid but further info here is  irrelevant), 4.5 consecutive years on HRT. weight fluctuates all over  the place, up or down around a third of my body weight in a matter of 3  months feels almost normal to me, lately. For the last month or slightly  longer, I've had an issue that has progressively worsened. I seem to be  unable to eat anything and keep the entire meal down. Maybe the first  two or three bites are fine, but even a sandwich is too much for me most  of the time. I don't feel particularly stressed, but I do feel like I'm  kind of fat, despite being largely a healthy weight for my frame, and  only looking overweight in my belly area. The thought of stepping on a  scale and seeing that I have lost weight, even a half pound, makes me  feel elated. I tell people I am fat when they mention food or clothing,  and they look at me like ""girl you crazy."" wanna weigh a number that I  know isn't a healthy number for myself.

I'm frankly, afraid to put food in myself and force it down only for  it to come up about 45 minutes later. I'd like to check into a rehab  clinic but I don't have the money nor the credit to do so, and I'll have  insurance in \~45 days. can't decide if I need to check in sooner or not.

I have read a lot about EDs trying to see what is  happening to me and I would come to a conclusion that in the past 3  years I suffered from bulimia, orthorexia, body dysmorphia, anorexia and  overeating. The main reason I developed it is because I started with a  strict gym regime where I lost a lot of weight. I tried to stay on that  weight (which now looking back was too low) and that’s where the problem  was. Also, my perception of food was (and still is) totally distorted.  It was then when I started purging the meals that I didn’t perceive as  “clean”. Later that developed into a full blown overeating and purging  period and I gained all the lost weight back plus more. I felt miserable  with myself for years. 

Recently, I lost the weight again in a very unhealthy way by mostly  starving myself, overtraining and purging. For the past month I’ve been  overeating most of the days, since I guess my body was starving and I  gained some of the weight back, as well as the feeling of misery. When I  do this, I buy all the “bad” food that I can find, come home and stuff  myself with it until I fall asleep or can’t breathe anymore. Then I fall  asleep and purge when I wake up. I rarely eat a proper healthy meal,  but I always tell myself that I will. Then I decide not to eat for a  whole day as a restriction and at one point I start starving and I buy  unhealthy food again. And that’s the circle I am in… 

My main problem is that I noticed how this is starting to seriously  effect other fields of my life. I am often depressed but right now  mostly numb to everything, I can’t remember when was the last time I was  happy and laughing, I avoid social events, I don’t eat with other  people, I get foggy brain and I feel cold when I starve myself, I can’t  sleep if I completely don’t stuff myself and my perception of myself is  based solely on how I look and with that also my mood. I only feel  satisfied with my body when I look like a undeveloped girl and it  bothers me when my breast start to show.  I really don’t want to go through those “miserable years” again and I  want to start with my recovery. I have been trying to figure out this by  myself, since seeking professional help is too expensive for me. I  haven’t told my parents or my friends, but they’ve noticed that I have  phases, either underweight or overweight, also I think this is a very  sensitive topic so nobody directly asked me anything and I always made  some kind of excuses for my unusual eating patterns.

My friend of 5+ years who I've known since I was 15 is really worrying me. I'll need to give some context because this is a long story, but I can't just sit and watch what's going on anymore.

He is 25 and about 6'0"" tall. He is very skinny, it is very noticeable when he wears tighter clothing like jeans. Sometimes when he's bad, I can see his skeleton on his chest and his face - his eyes get dark around the sockets and he complains of fatigue and bad moods (could also be job related, he is a hard worker, but runs on fumes and energy drinks to get him through the week).

We've lived together with a few other friends of ours in a house we rent for the past 3 years. I tried to put the idea forward of buying our groceries together weekly and that we could take it in turns cooking a meal every night for each other,  like a family.

Nobody fancied this idea and we just cook for ourselves and occasionally if I make too much I will split my meal in half for one of the other lads. Sometimes I make extra for my friend because he has no food to eat.

This is where the problem is, he doesn't cook at all and never buys proper quantities of food to eat. I don't think I have seen him prepare a proper meal even 10 times in the past 3 years we've been here. He lives on instant noodles, beans and bacon, with toast clumped in butter. Energy drinks and cigarettes. Amd his favourite, takeout Pizza.

Now for the serious part. Just a few months we were in the kitchen and I was cooking me and him dinner, when mid conversation his eyes rolled into the back of his head and he collapsed in front of me. Luckily I caught him and his head before he could hit the floor. After he woke up, he was totally out of it and had no idea of what had just happened. I urged him many a time to go get checked by his GP,  but he hasn't done anything!

On top of this, due to him only spending his wage on expensive takeout pizza/burgers, daily energy drinks, noodles, tobacco and sugary snacks, he is coming short and having to borrow money from me to buy food, but it's all going straight on takeout again.

I'm no nutrition expert but this diet is a recipe for disaster. Not only does he never eat vegetables or fruit, but he doesn't get enough protein or calories to sustain the body of a 25 year old man.

He says every time he will do a proper food shop but he never does, and later that night or the next day it'll be more takeout again... I feel like I'm helping my best friend commit suicide!

How can I help him? Not only is he physically being ruined by this, but mentally he appears to be deteriorating too.

I don't know who to speak to about this because I don't want to seem like I'm obsessing over his life choices, but after knowing the guy for so long and seeing him in clear decline, I think I would be a horrible friend to not try and help him.

I don't think he even knows he has some kind of eating disorder, he seems to just think its normal when it's not.

2513,EDPostRequests,1631266998,plht6t,"I have struggled with eating since my mid teens, I am 22 (m) now. I’ve struggled with multiple eating disorders: anorexia, orthorexia, BED. For the greater part of my ED history, I have had the most difficulty with anorexia. At the moment I find myself cycling through all of them: very low cal diet as long as I can while exercising &gt; eventual failure persisted by binge eating leading to intense workouts from post binge guilt. Repeat. Throughout the years, it has never become a severe physical health risk, but I’m quite sure it contributed to the permanent digestive issues that I now have and am medicated for. On the other hand, it has been a never ending torment to my mental health. Within the past 2 years, it has consumed most of my day to day life.

&amp;#x200B;

There have been times where I’ve managed to maintain a healthy eating regimen, but it never lasts. Funnily enough, I feel the most in control when successfully maintaining an eating disorder; it evokes a rewarding feeling. The days in which I’m unsuccessful in my ED ambitions, I feel worthless and shameful. I’m constantly keeping track of certain dates to gauge how I should eat in the following weeks, or, pushing back/cancelling plans if I’m not yet satisfied with my self imposed eating boot camp, if you will.

I’m just really tired of it all. I’m tired of constantly postponing my happiness to some undetermined date that keeps moving further and further away until my body looks a certain way. My stomach sinks every time I realize my youth is passing me by while I wallow in self loathing. Most of all, I feel deep sadness at my inability to self love.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m aware that I use eating disorders to ‘bandaid’ a bigger issue of self perception, and that I would benefit from reaching out to a professional of sorts (which I’m looking into).

So, between the ages of 15-19ish I struggled with an undiagnosed restrictive eating disorder. As far as physical symptoms go, it never got that severe, but it was extremely mentally taxing, as it consumed a majority of my daily thoughts. Eventually, the obsession with it subsided as I got more determined to recover for the sake of my future family.

Fast forward to several years later, and I'm living off of my savings in college, besides a small income from a part-time minimum wage job. I had all these plans for what I wanted to cook and eat for myself in college so I could eat healthier (meaning, actually eating fruits and veggies on a daily basis and skipping the ramen). But sticker shock quickly set in; combine that with anxiety about my financial future, laziness from depression and schoolwork, and I've headed the opposite direction. I find myself avoiding buying food under any circumstance. I avoid going to the grocery store, I avoid going out to eat, I feel good every time I skip a meal because I think of the money I'm saving.

However, I haven't started eating more, despite having less reason not to. My parents are kind enough that they're now giving me $20 a week for food. I find myself feeling unreasonably guilty about eating my boyfriend's food. And besides, I'm rarely in the mood to eat, especially if I'm really hungry. Occasionally, I just feel a general fear of eating food.

But it's not like I'm afraid of getting fat, like before. I rather wish I were more muscular and curvier. Although I will admit that, deep down, very specific things like seeing a bigger number on a scale, or pants feeling tighter trigger me.

Is this an eating disorder? If you have any coping strategies or directions I can pursue out of this, that would be great.

I (m18) struggle to eat, I’m not sure if it counts as an eating disorder but I do count calories and sometimes skip meals. My friend (m18) has just told me that he is also struggling with eating, from what he has told me it is very similar to mine. So I have a few questions:

Q: I know that there are many different forms of ED and not everyone fits a label, but does what I described count as an Ed?

Q: Should I tell him about me as well? No one knows about my issues with eating, I have just been dealing with it on my own, I’m worried that if I tell him about mine it will be too much for him.

Q: How do I help him out? I have been there as much as I can for him but I don’t know what to say or do as to not trigger him, I’m just really worried about him.

Hello,

Recently I haven't been eating all that much. I've definitely lost weight, and although that is a good thing as I am overweight, I don't think its happening in a healthy way. You see, I recently started my second year at college. Last year I had similar eating issues, as I had found going to the cafeteria to be exhausting and a drag on my day, so eventually I kinda just stopped going unless I absolutely had to eat something. This year its kind of the same, except I'm eating even less and I've developed this anxiety, almost like a sense of dread, that comes on when I think about having a full meal. Even when I do challenge that anxiety and go to the caf to get some food (since I know I need to eat), I find it difficult to actually get a solid amount of food down. Every single time there's always something left on my plate, and although I want to eat it, I simply can't. Today, I couldn't even finish one piece of lasagna. It tasted fine, but getting it down made me feel like I was going to throw up.

I feel like this lack of eating is leading to brain fog and a general feeling of low energy, and I don't know what to do about it. I want to eat more, but my body isn't agreeing. I also have this weird feeling in my stomach that happens when I'm hungry but it feels so odd that if anything it makes me not want to put anything in my stomach over fear I might chuck it all up. I don't really know what to do anymore and I'm starting to get really worried about this. Its stressing me out a lot. Has anyone else here had symptoms like this? Do you know what to do about it?

Also as a sidenote I am bipolar type two and have been in therapy for many years, am on medication to control mania and depression aswell as insomnia, and I smoke weed daily, usually to relax and go to sleep.

Hi,

 My mother has struggled with disorder eating for as long as I can remember. As for myself, I have been struggling with maintaining a healthy weight due to anxiety and OCD for the past 2 years.

I have been noticing she stares at my body when I talk to her lately. It makes me very uncomfortable. To the point that I deliberately cover up in really baggy clothes if I’m going to be interacting with her. I’ve brought it up with her, but she denies she does it. However, the last time I said something along the lines of “please stop looking at my body” she said that I had a “beautiful body”.

For parents who struggle with disordered eating, is this something that’s normal?

I’m trying to be supportive during her recovery and be there for her, but it really makes me uncomfortable and makes me not want to see her in person.

Additionally his self hatred making complimenting him or telling him I love him impossible. He will respond “how could you love this fat piece of shit?” So ive started saying it less.

I don't know if that info will be of benefit in knowing but my confusion around eating hasn't really been in the forefront of my mind. Until the other day. I had a breakdown because the store didn't have my white castle cheeseburgers. Looking back now, my appetite is and always has been weird/wanky. The white castle burgers is what I've been eating for the last couple of months, nearly everyday w/ my cup of cereal for lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

I do this with different foods all the time. I eat a specific food until I absolutely can't anymore. When the food that I am hungry for is not available, I break down. I can't just get in the pantry and easily grab/make something else. My brain simply doesn't work that way for.

&amp;#x200B;

Side Note: It may seem weird but I really don't consider myself to be a picky eater per se on what foods I actually like. I love just about every veggie out there and every meat source. I don't eat raw foods i.e. sushi. Besides that my variety seems endless.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this last food ""episode"" made me conscious that this is Not the first time I had a breakdown over food like this. The amount of mental work it takes to figure out what my body will accept to eat is quite concerning. I try so hard to work my appetite up, and sometimes to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

More often than not, thinking of certain foods make me feel gaggy and nauseous and I'd rather not eat at all. I push something down anyway in those instances because I know my body needs nourishment.

&amp;#x200B;

I do struggle w/ self esteem issues and C-PTSD but not really anything to do with my weight though. When I eat THC, I could eat anything under the sun. It ramps up my appetite and sometimes a little too much blood sugar wise (I'm also diabetic and have other health issues than what's been previously listed above) I don't want to depend on getting it in order to be able to eat. It's pricey and I can't really afford it nor want to be high all the time.

Side Note: I don't and never have binged/purged. I have No want to. I'm not on a specific hardcore diet. I don't do calorie deficits or any type of fasting trends. I rarely ever drink a diet soda/caffeine. I don't eat out often. Stick to water or milk. I don't have an unhealthy relationship w/ candy-sweets.

I’ve posted a question on here before about how to support her and I got so many great voices in support. I understand I can’t force her decisions or make her get help. She doesn’t choose to propel her anorexic habits and I understand that. As of recently, I have been terrified for her safety. For the past while she has been fasting an unreasonable amount, and either doesn’t eat sufficiently in the periods she can, or schedules the eating periods when she is asleep. She has also intertwined herself in pro-ana communities and now has support for her anorexic habits. I feel helpless. She hasn’t been officially diagnosed so she thinks she doesn’t has anorexia. I don’t know what to do now. I am one of the only people that know about it, and the only person trying to help her. Her family doesn’t care to help, and everyone else that knows is in a pro-ana group.

2534,EDPostRequests,1632131862,prrn6b,"Hi everyone, I didn't know where to write or even if i should meddle in this. Anyway, here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend has a cousin who came to study in the same city as us last year. He comes to visit very often and is currently staying with us for some weeks. My boyfriends family always referred to him as thin, but he is severely underweight and sickly looking. I mean i was taken aback the first time i saw him, i thought he might have some kind of health issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway i started suspecting he might have an ED when i noticed how much he would say he is eating. Like in any random conversation with him he would say that a day before he ate this and that (lists about xxx kcal worth of food - a large amount). Without me asking or without the topic being about food. Are random lies about food consumption a symptom of an ED?

&amp;#x200B;

Every time he comes to visit he is always about to faint and is physically very weak (as in he struggles to hold even his bags). When i ask him if he has eaten anything and to make dinner, he will reply that on that specific day he was very busy and then will proceed to mention how much he had eaten the other days.

&amp;#x200B;

And now since he is staying with us i noticed that when we sit down to eat he will have at least one glass of water before eating, 2-3 during food and one after. And then he goes to the bathroom afterwards. I might be imagining things, but i thought he might be throwing up.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if i should even bring this up, it's probably none of my business, should i say anything to him or even what i should say. I have no clue how to approach this. Even if he doesn't have an ED, being as skinny as he is and not eating until the point a person feels nauseous isn't healthy.

A year and a half ago, I decided to cut out fast food from my diet just to be healthier, which has been amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the blue, about a year ago, my weight started fluctuating more than usual. I figured it was maybe due to cutting out the fast food and didn’t pay it much mind until 6 months ago when it was dropping pretty rapidly. At this time, I was trying to put on muscle, so this was frustrating for me. For my entire life, I’ve never really eaten much (I look back on my childhood and see a lot of disordered eating habits that I never noticed that fueled my ED later in life), but at the time I was trying to put on muscle, I was eating normal, regularly scheduled meals.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw my doctor and got blood work done which came back perfect. I genuinely thought I was going to see thyroid issues or SOMETHING.

Now, for the last few months I’ve been having trouble eating. Barely anything interests me or makes me hungry and I feel sick whenever I eat or look at food.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had history of having a funny relationship with food and I feel it's all catching up with me now.

&amp;#x200B;

As a child I used to eat a lot of food and never gain the weight from it, on my dads side they'd tease me for how much I ate and would offer me more food when I'd finish and sort of... let other families know I was a big eater. On my mums side my mum would worry I would get diabetes and my sisters would call me fat for what I'd eat even though I wasn't physically, even my friends at school would give me names such as ""fatass"" because of how I'd eat! as i got older my appetite died down a lot, to the point I could only manage 1 meal a day but there wasn't really any extra thought to it, I just couldn't manage to eat more than that.

&amp;#x200B;

However people started to notice I was losing weight and I started to notice too, my mum asked if I was starving myself and at that time I wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

The sudden weight loss was a worry at first, I thought it was a sign of cancer or something? but after receiving a lot of compliments on my figure and how slim I was I started to enjoy it and kept up with measuring and weighing myself.

&amp;#x200B;

It came to a point where I was almost underweight, I become almost obsessive over how I looked and how much I weighed and I still am, however through covid things seemed to decline and I started using food as a sort of... punishment? I wouldn't eat all day if I hadn't done something ""worthy"" of it, now what makes me question if this is an eating disorder or not is because I'd also restrict myself on when I could go to the toilet, if I was ""worthy"" enough to go.

&amp;#x200B;

But as time goes on I'm still obsessed with how I look and my weight, I'm about to buy scales and I've made a goal for myself to actually hit that underweight mark, I almost brag to people that I'm almost there? I know it's not great and I'm the only one proud of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel guilt when I do eat heavy things like an actual meal, I can't even remember my last proper meal? I have a tenancy to binge on junk foods and sugary snacks at nighttime too when everyone is asleep, I still feel guilty and hate myself for it in the morning. But there are times where I can eat fine through the day and not feel guilty, times where I go out my way to eat? but I always come back to the restrictive eating.

&amp;#x200B;

Today just for example all I ate was a few yogurts and I felt really proud of myself for it, I felt hunger pains and felt accomplished by it?

&amp;#x200B;

To summarise, I've made a goal to become underweight, I feel immense guilt when I eat but sometimes I'm okay with eating, I use food as a threat to myself (if I feel like a failure I will starve myself), I binge at night when no one can see me eating junk.

Hi Reddit. I’m 16, and a guy. I’ve been dealing with disordered eating and unhealthy thinking around my relationship with food since I was a preteen, and I think it’s affecting me largely enough to reach the point of an eating disorder of some kind.

I’m not going to detail too much as that’s not really what this post is about, but I restrict, I think as a result of both being unhappy with the way I look and feeling out of control of other things around me. I feel guilty about not eating healthily or exercising as much as I should, but in trying to do so I have always just ended up making myself feel worse and doing it for the wrong reasons. I used to develop a lot of weird stomach issues and with the handful of medications I’ve cycled through quite a few have really messed with my appetite, including my ADHD medication which of course I take daily. I’ve tried to deal with it on my own but as my general mental health has been improving a lot (which I am so grateful for), my habits and thoughts around eating have not and I think it might be time for me to get help.

I’ve mentioned my eating somewhat in passing to my mom and my former therapist, but neither seemed to understand fully what I was getting at. One of the first things I talked to my therapist about was how I felt I did not think of food in a healthy way but it was kind of just left there, and I mentioned to my mom when she began to notice my eating habits getting worse again during the very first lockdown here in Canada how I sometimes eat less if it means feeling in control of something. That was basically where the conversation ended. I don’t blame either of them because I have a hard time accurately describing things and minimizing them when I do, and I didn’t quite talk about the extent of these thoughts and behaviours.

I’m afraid to ask anybody for help and talking properly about how bad it’s gotten in the past and how it affects me day-to-day, even on good days, because I feel a strong sense of shame surrounding this aspect of my mental health. People generally think of EDs as a ‘girl thing’ which logically I know is absolutely not true and in theory I know that there’s no shame in the struggle that I’m having, but when I think about telling somebody and having them look at me and KNOW that this is something that’s on my mind all the time, I just feel so mortified. The thought of telling my mom makes me feel ill, and I have a very strong relationship with my mom and tell her everything, she’s been my main support through every other struggle I’ve had with my mental health and she’s supportive and understanding beyond what I would have ever hoped. But I just can’t stomach the idea of telling her more about this than I already have. I’m scared of telling anybody. The only person who really knows is my best friend, who also struggles with it. He’s the only one I’ve ever really talked about things in detail with, but of course he can only do so much and generally we steer away from talking about it with each other to avoid triggering the other or something.

Even typing this and sharing with people who will never know my name or anything about me other than this, I feel terrible. I don’t even really know why. I guess by admitting that something is wrong in more than my own head means it’s more real and I’m not ready for things to turn upside down to make me better somehow, and also maybe I just don’t want things to not be okay. I don’t know. But I’m really not sure what to do. I don’t want to feel like this all the time and trying to fix it on my own hasn’t worked but I also don’t want to talk to people and have them see me the way I see myself, as weak or something. I don’t know. I’m also scared of what treatment might look like for me. The idea of meal plans or being monitored in any way or anything just makes me feel sick and the idea of eyes on my eating habits more than they already might be makes me feel so anxious. I feel like I’m not ready to get help yet but I’ve also been telling myself that for years and I really want to feel better and be able to eat without feeling guilty. Sorry for the long post, I just really don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go or who to talk to, I considered talking to a teacher I trust but again I’m scared of how they might see me and I’m scared of burdening them with my issues or making them worry or something.

Thank you in advance for any and all help. I don’t entirely know what I’m looking for, because I don’t know if I will end up getting help any time soon.

The only “food” I can really think about eating without getting nauseous is like Naked Juices and soup, but let’s be honest, it’s unrealistic to switch to “drinking meals” for the rest of my life so I’d like to relearn how to want to eat food. I haven’t always been like this, maybe the past 2 years or so. I remember I used to not mind chewing, I used to crave food. It’s starting to become a real issue because it takes me forever to get anything done because my life revolves around forcing myself to eat.

I’m a teen in high school and around 3-4 years ago I ran into some issues with my weight. I thought that skipping meals would make people like me more since in middle school I was made fun of but not necessarily for my weight ever. I was very awkward and what most people would consider unattractive. So I began to drop weight like crazy and eventually my friends said they’d tell someone. Fast forward a year and I started to get into makeup, it started out very natural and light but it turned into a full face for school every single day. The guys and girls that made fun of me now paid extra attention to me. I was called beautiful by everyone even some of my siblings guy friends and soccer teammates. Problem is that I look disgusting without it and I have to wake up early every morning to put on this mask. And even after years my weight problem has never gone away, I throw out lunch at school to stay under a weight and I refuse breakfast. I get extreme guilt and panic when I go over a set number of cals. I cant tell my mom or an adult because my own mom even said I’m wearing too much makeup and asked what I’d do if these boys saw me without it.

I experienced reflux, ibs, bloating, chest pains, nausea, LPR (reflux which affects the vocal chords and upper body/nasal passages), and about a million other symptoms. Stomach pain, burning, belching, indigestion, you name it. We did a million tests. Put me on a million meds. Nothing worked, and my reflux score was through the roof. No SIBO, no H. Pylori, no ulcers, nothing. Except for a small hiatal hernia, that is. I qualified for surgery, and am supposed to get it in a month. However, about 6 months into this whole ordeal, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis, and just so happened to start recovery and gaining weight at this time. See the connection?

The GP was initially bad, and while I never threw up, I had bear constant nausea and stomach pains. Then, I followed a low fat, low fiber diet. Up until this point I had literally been limiting myself to one meal of bland chicken and rice a day, believing it to be healing as that’s what all the acid reflux groups told me to do (look up the Acid Watchers Diet- absolute anorexia fuel).

Eventually, my dad realized that I was using this diet as a way to fuel my ED.I was tired and in pain and sick of not eating what I wanted. The kicker was that the diet wasn’t even helping. So now I was miserable AND refluxing daily. So I said fuck it. I may as well eat what I want and deal with the consequences. So I did just that- I ate what I wanted. Chocolate, coffee, pizza, all the bad GERD foods. And it was bad for a bit, but then… it got better. And it just kept getting better the more my restrictions lifted. Every day I tried a new food that I hadn’t touched in years, whether it be due to the ED or low acid diet. And every day, I felt a little better. Now, I have gained \_\_ lbs and eat whatever I want. And I still have occasional nausea and sadly nightly reflux every night (my LES is shit, when I lay down it all comes up no matter what), but Jesus fucking Christ I feel so FREE and GOOD for the first time in forever. That’s great right?

Now my fear: I’m supposed to get a Nissen Fundiplication surgery and hiatal hernia repair in November. It’s supposed to get rid of my reflux for good. The drawbacks, however, are as follows; 3 months of a restricted liquid recovery diet, the inability to ever burp/vomit again, will be restricted against certain foods forever, a high chance that it will CAUSE GASTROPARESIS, a high fail rate after 5 years, and the inability to ever lift more than 50 lbs again.

Look, I know horror stories are everywhere and that I should just ignore them, but I can’t. I’m just stumped, I planned my life around the idea of getting this surgery in November. I postponed school for it. But my dad is terrified that it’s a big mistake, and that restricting will only make things worse again. He says that if I need to get the surgery later in life, to do it, but if my GI issues are manageable now and only getting better to not risk it.

&amp;#x200B;

I, myself haven't personally suffered any form of eating disorder so I find it really hard to understand how it impacts someone and their emotions and sense of self - so I'm desperately seeking help.

&amp;#x200B;

I met my partner during a time when she had relapsed and was very thin, the usual visible bones and really hollow face

&amp;#x200B;

Since being together I've been really trying to help her with her recovery and encourage her, cook her meals that actually taste amazing so she can find some joy in eating. This has all worked great and she's slowly put weight back on.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm worried because she keep referring to herself as gross and fat etc - when really she just looks like an average human now.

&amp;#x200B;

What are some things I can do or say to reassure her that she looks perfectly fine and normal? Are there anything I should avoid saying or do? Are there any behaviours I shouldn't play into?

This has been an issue for most of my life where I have zero portion control and put a lot more on my plate than I should and still feel hungry afterwards. I’d ask my stepmom if would be okay for me to eat something a few hours after eating dinner and usually she’d say no. My parents would have to make some of my food for me because I didn’t know when too much was too much. My stepmother also made a rule one day where I had to wait for someone to be in the kitchen in order to eat or be anywhere near the kitchen, but this rule never happened.

Me and my parents have argued many times about portion control and Ive gotten grounded before because of it. It’s gotten so bad that I’d steal snacks from other people (my stepmoms room as an example). An example being that one night I was still hungry after eating dinner so I grabbed a donut and took it up to my room, which I didnt think anything of at the time. But now I realize that that was a dumb decision because 1. The donuts are only for breakfast and 2. I took one when I didn’t even know if anyone else had any yet. My stepmom immediately knew that I had took them and this was the conversation:

Stepmom: I know you think you are slick coming down here and taking donuts while I’m in the bathroom! You are ridiculous! You felt the need to take the rest of what was in that box but one half!? You might as well have taken that one too! You don’t listen to anyone! You know you aren’t supposed to be doing that shit!

Me: I took one and I thought that one half was for someone else cause it was only one half.

Stepmom: You had more than one tonight. I don’t care that you want to have more than one donut, but you should have waited until tomorrow.

Stepmom: That’s too much in one night, you have to start having some self control. I hate that I have to hide everything because you can’t control yourself. Everything in moderation girl.

Stepmom: I love you and don’t want to see you have health issues like me. That’s why I get on you.

I don’t really know why I do this. I believe I do it because I’m bored and that food is the only thing that’s really enjoyable to me anymore. I’ve also had an unhealthy diet as a child so that probably makes it worse. But I know that I need to stop doing this, especially considering I’m overweight and barely do any exercise cause I’m afraid of people judging me.

For six+ months I’ve been doing so much better. Today, a friend of mine told me I look like someone (tiktok) famous, who just so happens to be plus size (makeup videos, their body is never even in shot). They’re a beautiful person, and their makeup is amazing, and all of the comments are telling her how beautiful she is, and she is beautiful. But how come after six + months of doing ok, it broke me? I haven’t felt this triggered in so long. I had my first meal at 2pm today after work (unplanned, but something me a year ago would’ve been proud of) and after receiving her message saying I looked like her, I suddenly felt disgustingly guilty about eating as I was about to take my last few bites. I didn’t take them, and now I’m scared about how long this fog will last.

I’ve never been that triggered about anything before during my improvement with food until now. It feels so scary, it feels like I want to hide and not eat and not wear anything nice or do my makeup or see anyone at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now being followed by a nutritionist who gave me a weekly meal plan to follow: I went from eating very very little, tirelessly exercising, to following a balanced and satisfying meal plan, not really exercising besides some light walking (I was advised not to exercise heavily because we're trying to get my period back). My main problem right now, though, is: snacks.

&amp;#x200B;

I used not to have them before (not for lack of hunger, of course) but my nutritionist added them to the plan, and while the first few days went somewhat good (my body was a bit confused because my hunger signals are completely fucked up right now, and I didn't know whether I was hungry or not, whether I wanted more food or not, etc.), the past few ones have been odd.

&amp;#x200B;

After I eat my snack, I get this incredible energy crash where I feel completely low, irritable, sleepy and am unsure whether I am getting 'about to faint' signals from my body. It doesnt really happen after my meals though, so it must be something tied to the snacks.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know how normal this is, I mean I'm thinking it might have something to do with my metabolism suddenly getting all this energy that it was lacking before, and using it all up, but I don't know. My weight (in the low-healthy range) has been somewhat stable for now, it's a little bit less than what it was when I was last visited by my nutritionist, but less than half a lb. I'm trying to follow my meal plan as best as I can, although it's not always easy as you all know.

I had to attend an occupational health meeting for my new job a few months ago (I am a doctor myself) just to go through my medical history and my ED was brought up. I definitely got the impression that the doctor seeing me had a slight judgmental tone (if not a bit disapproving); although I’m used to it, as I’ve had bad experiences as a patient when doctors/health professionals find out I’m a doctor struggling with ED. She then asked about all my ED behaviours in detail, which I felt extremely uncomfortable talking about as she was a complete stranger and even with therapists it takes some time to open up. She weighed me as well, which I suffer a lot of anxiety from and have not done so in a long time.

Hello, I think today I’ve reached my breaking point/ break through of realizing where I am at and it’s been sudden and I am very confused. I want to schedule a check up with a doctor in the next week and be proactive, but I’m just so confused at the same time of how I got here.

I didn’t ever have a problem with my weight and I’ve never hated it, barely thought about it, but things happened so fast and it feels like I hadn’t even realized it. So that’s kinda why I’m confused if I have an ED.

I have been around an average weight most of my life. 2-3 years ago I was slightly overweight due to a medical condition which I gained that weight in 3 months, then lost the same amount of weight in three months due to medication (doctors told me it was water weight/ inflation from the medication). But even then, I never really put much thought into my weight or appearance.

After that year, I’ve maintained my average healthy weight until very recently and I don’t know why but it went unnoticed. The last time I weighed myself four months ago, I was exactly my healthy weight. Since the pandemic started I’ve just been wearing sweats, hoodies, not putting much effort because I just wanted to be comfortable because I am staying home. My family and friends I see on a daily had not made any comments on my appearance either, I’m guessing since they see me everyday, they don’t notice subtle changes.

But it was yesterday that I met up with friends I hadn’t seen in a year. And the first thing, and the only thing they brought up was “you lost so much weight, your cheekbones are so prominent, you look like a model with that jawline” and questions along those lines.

And that is when I became self conscious, confused, all of the emotions basically. I didn’t have a problem with being an average weight for my height. And now it’s just making me reflect on my body more. My diet has remained the same, in fact I am eating more than I had before, I am exercising way less too. So I’m just in a confused state.

Today, I finally weighed myself. I am very underweight. I haven’t been this weight since I was in elementary school ten years ago. I took my hoodie and sweats off and looked at myself in the mirror. I put my hands around my waist and my fingertips are a few inches from touching each other. I broke down.

I want to be proactive health wise because I know this weight can be dangerous so I am scheduling an appointment because I haven’t changed any sleep, food, or exercise habits, and my mood was happier than ever so I do have underlying health concerns.

But I am here on this subreddit because psychologically, I am just confused, panicked, I don’t know what to do because I don’t know how I got here in such little time. Is this an ED, do I have BD? I know I need to get medical help but will they also provide me with therapeutic help? Has anyone else ever been through this?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeking advice on how to deal with my sister or people in general who say things that trigger you. Recently my sister has been saying all the time “I haven’t eaten all day” when we are sitting down for dinner or just throughout the day. I’ve told her once before that it’s not healthy to go without eating a whole day and she shouldn’t be promoting it or proud of it. She just tells me to shut up and to stop being sensitive. My family is unaware of my ED as well. I don’t plan on telling them at the moment, as I can barley admit anything to myself.

&amp;#x200B;

i’m also a healthy weight, and am moderately athletic although i’m not working out right now. i do have okayish self confidence, i have a history of hating my body but it’s getting better after a residential visit. i’ve never had an eating disorder before technically but i did try to develop the habits, to which i don’t want to do so again because it’s unhealthy and i don’t want an eating disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

the problem is that i am losing weight. i’m still healthy, but physically i’m always exhausted, like dragging my feet, my hair is dull, my skin is dry, and i cannot concentrate for the life of me. i like snap in and out of what i’m doing. i also don’t want to eat more because the weight loss is kinda nice and i’m not hungry so it’s not appealing anyways.

idk. i’m not necessarily trying but idk sometimes it feels like i have an ed and sometimes i genuinely think i’m fine. i just really really really would be so upset if i did because that’s just another thing i would have to work on.

final note, my best friend has an eating disorder and i see the way she operates and i don’t support it or copy her whatsoever, because it’s clearly unhealthy and i don’t want to make myself miserable. if i want icecream i eat icecream. the end.

During our last session she asked me how it was going and at some point I asked her if she thinks I have an Ed, and she responded that she thinks that it seems that it’s still a hobby to me and that I just like spending time being busy with body image and calorie tracking and that an eating disorder becomes a disorder once you physically can’t do things anymore like going to a school etc and also that I didn’t look that unhealthy anyways and damn it really messed me up 💀.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother and her husband (not my bio dad) always made comments about gaining weight even though I’ve always been thin and athletic. I think they were maybe projecting, idk. Lots of “once on the lips, twice on the hips”, “weight gain in your face is hard to lose and your face is round enough” (my face is not round at all), and other comments about my stomach having fat rolls (again, I have always been athletic, so these did not exist).

I’m not really sure why it would be manifesting now that I’m in my early 20s; their comments usually went in one ear and out the other but now I can’t help but think that I look overweight. Particularly in my face, stomach, and hips. I know that, logically and realistically, I do not have any excess weight but I still fixate on it. I’m not super obsessed with counting calories or anything like that, but I do go one or two days at a time without eating on a regular basis and when I do eat, it’s usually something small like a bowl of cereal. I’m just worried I’ll put on weight, I guess.

Again, not sure why it’s only now becoming an issue, but both my doctor and my therapist agree that I need to see someone about this.

And im not doing this on purpose or to try and lose weight, i cant control when this happens. so then im finally able to eat, and i take one bite and im completely full. and for the people saying ""you have to force yourself to eat"" i literally cant because ive tried that many times and i usually throw up, not on purpose. sometimes food is just completely overwhelming and i literally just dont want it to touch my tongue. i dont have the mental energy to mash up food with my mouth or swallow it, everything sounds gross and makes me depressed. (it also doesnt help that i live in america and the fda approves carcinogens in our food) so for example, i couldnt eat for  days because the timing wasn't right (literal time of the day and other variables that include stress, feeling of stomach, how hot or cold the environment is and type of food + the texture of the food) and then today i decided i had to eat an entire pizza to make up for the calories i lost from not eating, and that gives me stomach aches which cause more anxiety. and now i wont eat until probably tomorrow night because i have work in the morning and it stresses me out so bad i cant eat there its so gross nobody wears their mask in the break room.

ive been having this same problem for about 5 years now and i am currently almost 21 and weigh about xx pounds (very low).

the only things that make it kind of bearable are mirtazapine and smoking weed.

Hello! So recently I have been experiencing some really weird effects  of eating and im not sure if its a new manifestations of anxiety (  which has been a lot higher lately) or an actually reaction to food.  Here is some quick context on my recovery. My ED was really only active for about a year, during which I was of  course dangerously underweight and lost my period for over a year. I  have been following a Refeeding plan since march which really kicked  into high gear only in august when I had to move back home for a kind of  ""stay at home as an inpatient"" type of treatment. Since then ive been  steadily gaining weight every week, and have been cleared to start doing  exercise! (yoga and walking. nothing too intense ). In the beginning of  my Refeeding process I ofc. experienced a lot of bloating, and burping  and gas. As is what expected from introducing your intestines to food  again and slowly building the proper microbiomes to help digest food.  It's since stopped and I feel less physically uncomfortable from the  food that ive been eating. My nutritionist says my stomach has just  about stretched back to a normal size.  So here lies the problem.... I feel so nauseous after I eat, every time I eat. Though nothing I have  been eating has changed. I have been following my meal plan exactly  (  still haven't introduced food challenges yet). I am able to have variety  with my foods while still staying constistent. but IM BURPING ALL THE  TIME TO THE POINT WHERE IM SPITTING UP MY FOOD LIKE A BABY. It's  terrible!!! I'm burping and my food is rising up my throat again I can  taste it!!! Is this normal???? I feel like this is a sign that I can  start  reducing the amount of food I am eating bescause I eat soooo  much. but im approaching being at a my set weight soooo. I feel like  this is sign of my body saying ""it's okay, your good. keep feeding me  but I don't need this much food anymore"". The real kicker is...... even  though I am literally nauseous and burping, I a m s t I l l  hu n g r y.  My therapist stays this might just mean that my anxiety about my food  is making me have a physical reaction that immitates hunger.... which  then gets me more anxious.... which then makes me think im more hungry.  its a vicious cycle. anyway. if anyone has had any experience REMOTELY CLOSE TO THIS PLEASE  HELP ME OR JUST SHARE WHAT YOUVE BEEN THROUGH FOR SOME SEMBLENCE OF  CLARITY!!!1",Request: Is This Normal?

Hey there! So, I'm proud to say I've been recovering  from restrictive eating for a little over a year now and am now unable  to restrict which, frustrating as it may be at this moment, is a win for  my body. However, I'm finding that even though I've followed all the  advice my dietician has given me, I'm still dealing with constant hunger  and very mixed up hunger signals. Before my ED, I was definitely an  emotional eater and still am, so it's hard to differentiate all that,  but basically I simply don't ever feel full unless I've eaten a very  very large amount of food, and even then, the feeling goes away quickly.  My dietician has increased my protein and vegetable intake to try to  counteract it but I just can't stop bingeing. They're not huge binges,  but enough to cause me a lot of distress. I binge about every day and  it's really making it hard not to fall back into old habits to  counteract my weight gain.

Basically, I'm looking for advice on how to deal with this if anyone has any",Request: Tips on going through Extreme Hunger way into recovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/q6sl8e/request_tips_on_going_through_extreme_hunger_way/,1634085225,12-10-21 13:33

hello... im a 16 year old girl and i have recently  started recovery for my restrictive ed (early august). i am doing it  without outside help so i have given up a bunch of times and then kept  going and it hasnt been the most consistent journey but lately ive been  more dedicated to eating properly and i had been doing pretty well until  these past weeks. 

i have always struggled with binging in my disorder (mostly reactive  eating, and id always purge via fasting after it happened) but in  recovery it has gotten so much worse. i dont purge anymore, i told  myself id listen to my mental/extreme hunger and everything ive read  says you have to eat as much as you want when you're in recovery. i usually  dont tell myself ill restrict after eating ""too much"" or anything like  that. but when i try to listen to my ""mental hunger"" i always just end  up binging in secret, eating things i dont even want, eating past  satiety, eating very desperately even if i dont want to, even  hiding/stealing other peoples food etc etc 

im just really lost. i have no idea how to stop it, and i would  really appreciate some kind of help from anyone who has struggled with  binging? im wasting a TON of money on food because i just keep eating  and eating and eating and im doing horribly in school because i spend  the whole day binging and cooking instead of studying and i skip a ton  of classes because of the pain. and its not extreme hunger because i  dont do it out of hunger. when im too full i just chew and spit and i  cant make myself stop at all 

while restricting i had extreme hunger episodes and id binge on  fruit, vegetables etc and then purge and i knew it was directly caused  by restriction, but i have no idea what it is now? my binges are pretty  odd i think compared to what i usually see classified as binges and i  mean like sitting on the floor desperately eating 13kg of lettuce with  my hands ...... i dont restrict any specific foods either, and i always  binge on fruits and veggies and whole foods and honestly anything i can  find. i really think its some kind of food addiction (??) but i dont  understand because its not to sugar or whatever just.

id really appreciate any kind of advice on how to start getting  better...? i try my best not to restrict or let myself purge after  binging but even though im still underweight and i havent gained any  visible weight yet for whatever reason this is all really making the  other side of my ed panic and im afraid ill relapse into restriction  soon",Request: help with binging,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/q6skk1/request_help_with_binging/,1634085170,12-10-21 13:32

One of my good friends is dangerously underweight. He is seeing an osteopath and  physiotherapist to help him recover from the effects of a nasty bicycle  crash a few years ago, and both have told him there is no point  continuing the sessions unless he is able to put on some weight. 

I have had a number of conversations with him about it, and I don't  think he's in denial or has an overwhelmingly unhealthy psychological  relationship with food - it's more that after years of depression and  similar struggles he has neglected to care for himself and fallen into a  pattern of surviving off cans of red bull (4-6 a day at a guess) and  maybe one meal a day on a good day. As I say, I think this is more a  result of apathy than anything else.

My question is really around finding the balance between just being  his friend, and not trying to be his nurse or whatever - and actually  trying to help him. I really do believe if he were able to get some good  nutrition in and cut down on the energy drinks it could transform his  life, but I know he doesn't want me checking up on him etc.

Obviously one thing I can do is cook for him when I see him, and I do  that. But beyond that, what is the role of a friend in assisting him  with his struggle? I could text him a motivating message, or just ask  him if he's got calories in yet today, but as I say I don't want to be  his nurse. It is frustrating though when he complains about his  weakness, lack of energy, his back pain etc when it seems to me he isn't  acting in his own self interest.

Is this one of those 'cant help someone who won't help themself' scenarios? Or should I jostle and harry him along?

Ever since I can remember I’ve gone through cycles of starvation and binge eating and I have no idea what to do anymore.

When I was in middle school I was very heavy. My Sophomore year of high school i got into working out and by the time I was a freshman in college I was in the normal range, and I looked unhealthily skinny, and destroying my body working out didn’t help. I’d work out so much with eating less than xxx calories (low) a day that I’d just burn out after about 2 weeks of going insane with working out and then binge eat for a week or so, and this cycle repeated from 2018 to the pandemic.

During the pandemic I ate normally and worked out a bit less and got up to xxx (still in normal range) where I felt alright, but I was still binging when I wasn’t killing myself in the gym. This wasn’t sustainable once I went back to school and I ended gaining more. But I just can’t break this habit of starvation and binging.

This week at Muay Thai I almost fainted because of how little I ate the day of and before, and the past 3 days I’ve done absolutely nothing but eat garbage, and no matter what kind of meal and workout plans I make, mental “commitments” I promise myself, or anything along those lines I have not had a healthy relationship with food in my entire life.

I’m just in desperate need of help. I want to be able to eat a normal amount of food without being scared I’ll starve myself or binge, I want to be able to enjoy the physical activities I do without being in so much physical pain because I have no fuel for them, I want to be able to have a slice of pizza without creating the temptation to eat two pie’s by myself.

Me and my partner met about a year ago and have been dating since then. One of the things that I liked about him at the start was his positive outlook on life and his dedication to having a healthy diet, he started this lifestyle a few years ago after his ex developed diabetes from a poor diet.

I’m almost two years in recovery from an ED that consumed my early twenties, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been since I started eating normally again and I’m now a healthy weight and reasonably fit.

I told my partner about my recovery pretty early on in our relationship and he was very supportive. He said we should get healthy and fit together and I agreed, so I would eat what he ate when I stayed over at weekends and we would go for long walks together.

I didn’t realize the extent of his diet until a couple of months into our relationship. He eats absolutely no sugar and only eats fruit occasionally ‘as a treat’, everything has to be organic (which is great!) or better yet grown by himself, no fast food or anything cooked in vegetable oil, the only carbs he eats is whole grain rice etc. He obsessively checks the ingredients of anything we buy in the supermarket. We usually eat the same thing every night, some kind of fish with vegetables and occasionally a tomato sauce.

All of that is great on paper but the problem is he makes me follow this diet as well and gets very upset if I don’t, I baked a homemade loaf of bread recently and he started an argument about how unhealthy I was being. I have a sweet tooth and because of my ADHD I need caffeine regularly to be able to function normally, I’ve been sneaking out and having a soda a couple of times a week but the anxiety of getting caught gets worse every time I do it. I feel so sluggish during the day and end up binge eating when I visit family which makes me feel terrible.

I’ve tried to talk to him about this multiple times but he just doesn’t listen, I’ve said that I can feel my old ED habits creeping back in but he brushes it off and tells me I need to ‘get a grip’. I know it’s important to have a healthy diet but I also think it’s okay to sometimes enjoy a sugary drink on a night out or a piece of birthday cake but I know for a fact he start at argument at best or leave me at worst, if he ever caught me doing either.

This relationship is the best I’ve ever had and the only one I’ve ever been able to see lasting long term, I know he only acts like this because he cares about me and worries that I’ll get sick like his ex but I feel like I need to put my mental health first. I’m not sure what to do next to be honest, I’ve been thinking that maybe couples therapy could help but I don’t think he would agree to that.

My body was used and he said he wanted to send me to all of his friends to use my body as a cock sleeve too, like my body was an object and like I was a sex slave. My body’s trauma response was to freeze and fawn. It went against everything I wanted to do, which was to get away from him. He touched my body as he showered me. He forced my body to climax. He ejaculated inside of me without a condom and I had his semen in my anal cavity, and I still feel like remnants of him are stuck inside of me.

So I was wondering - studies more and more reveal  that the gut and the microbiome play an incredibly big part in our  wellbeing, as they are some kind of second brain. Having recovered from  bulimia, but still living with the antidepressants for over 10years, I  wonder how much of the depression that comes along with an ED stems from  the damaged gut health?

I absolutely NEED to recover. I restrict on weekdays, then I b/p on the weekends. I'm constantly hungry, constantly thinking about food, completely obsessed with it. I'm underweight, always cold, have terrible insomnia. My tongue burns and I have near constant acid reflux due to purging. My teeth are discoloured and my skin is pale and breaks easily. I'm losing hair. I am not productive and cannot focus at work. I'm moody and irritable.

But I don't want to go into treatment. I'm already followed by therapists and dietitians and all they've done is make things worse.

I hate meal plans. They're so restrictive. They only foster my obsessive tendencies around food. I see the meal plans they usually have in treatment centers and I already feel anxious because it feels like such little food. I already restrict myself. Getting told to restrict by professionals that are supposedly there to help you recover would be heart breaking. I don't want to eat at set times. I don't want to ""learn portion control"" and ""appropriate portion sizes"" (as if I don't know that myself). I don't want to ""eat balanced meals"". I don't want to ""enforce a controlled structure"". I don't want to be surrounded by other sick people like me and exchange tips and tricks. I don't want people to give me meals that don't satisfy me and then get told that binging is bad if I ask for more. I don't want to have to choose between freaking ""exchanges"" for a snack or a meal. I don't want to eat a single fist of protein sources or whatever. I just want to actually stop having an eating disorder, stop caring about food, stop being hungry, and start eating whatever I want without restriction. But I also know that if I did that right now that would mean binging and binging and binging and that would in turn mean purging. And I don't want to purge anymore.

I also don't want to get into treatment and having to get scrutinized by a bunch of therapists who copy paste their education on me. No my ED is not about control. No I don't have trouble with my parents. No I don't feel fat. No I'm not doing this for attention. No I didn't have an unhealthy childhood. No I'm not using food to soothe my anxiety and numb unpleasant emotions. Yes I know that there is no good or bad food. Yes I know that two rice crackers is not a meal. I've been freaking screaming these things for ages and no one ever bothered to listen - I've been told that I'm in denial and that ""if I don't wanna change then no therapist will make you change"". Yes I do wanna change, I'm just scared to do so, and I'm looking for effective help and I don't feel a treatment center would be able to deliver that.

I am in my early 20s, just graduated college, and living with my parents. My mom has been underweight my entire life, as far as I know, and has never been diagnosed with anorexia for whatever reason. If you didn’t know her like I do, you might call her “healthy” and you might be jealous of how strictly she sticks to her diet. But if you do know her like I do, you are aware of her extreme disorder, a disorder that has also impacted me, her daughter.

I can recall my earliest memory of being insecure about my body - 4th grade. I don’t know if this came from other mean girls around me or if this was as a result of my mom always restricting my food intake and controlling my entire life, but from that moment on I was extremely aware of my appearance. My issues have followed me to this point, causing me to have a binge eating disorder throughout middle school, high school, and college, whilst starving myself to get rid of the weight I gained from binging. For about a year, while being able to cook for myself and having the freedom to do what I wanted, I reached a point where I stopped checking my weight and was able to eat without feeling guilty. I stopped binging for the most part and was doing well. I gained some weight over this summer and when I was preparing to come back to live with my parents (packing for my flight) and I had an extreme panic attack. I think it was the thought of my mom seeing me after having gained visible weight that terrified me, coupled with the thought of having gained weight. So I got home, and my mom would not stop staring at me, encouraging me to go to the gym, etc. Sorry, this is the longest story ever.

So to summarize my mom, she has been gluten intolerant for many years (gluten free) but now has come up with a million other food intolerances, thus, restricting her from eating anything with carbs, fat, or processing. This may sound like someone who is orthorexic, but believe me, it’s anorexia. Nearly 95% of our conversations involve her bringing up exercise or food. She often talks about how she lost “the weight” she gained in college, when she was 5’6 and on the lower end of normal!!! And this is the worst because she says that she was so fat then, and that is less than I weigh now at the same height. Yes, I’m aware everyone has different bodies, but imagine how it feels when your mom weighs less 3/4 of what you weigh, and you’re almost the same height.

I don’t know what to do because I feel like it’s been so long that she’s been starving herself, I don’t know how she doesn’t have any drastic health problems. If anyone knows, could you tell me what some potential health problems are in adult anorexics? (55+). I know I personally can’t help her, but I just don’t know why her doctors aren’t doing anything. I feel like due to HIPPA, etc. I am unable to speak with her doctors about her health, but I fear that she will die if someone doesn’t intervene.

If anyone has any general advice for me and my situation, I would love to hear it. ❤️

I (19F) have only recently discovered that I have a restrictive eating disorder. And ever since I realized this, I haven't been able to get it off my mind.

Everytime I eat or look in the mirror or any reflective surfaces, I want to lose weight and I feel guilty for eating even just a little bit.

And recently people around me have started making remarks about my body. Maybe they've done so before and I'm only noticing it now, but it's really triggering for me. But in a weird way.

I've been called thin or slim more often over the past few weeks than ever before. I want to be thin, so shouldn't I be happy to hear this?

My mind processes it like this: ""You're so thin, but don't you want to be thinner than this?"" I don't feel thin, so being called that feels like a lie to me.

I'm not sure if there's any way to avoid this though. And I don't even know if there's any remarks about my body that won't trigger me.

This might be a bit long. I have struggled with eating issues since about age 10. I never had anorexia or bulimia, but was diagnosed with EDNOS at 14 (it was orthorexia, but that isnt a diagnosable ED). It sort of just went away over the years until recently.

At 19 i began taking psychiatric medications. I gained a lot of weight and just didnt care anymore. I became overweight. My mental health declined and i ate a ton, never excercised at all. After getting off the pills and on wellbutrin at 21, i started to lose it all very quickly. Ever since then, ive started having issues again. Id starve at work (i was working a very physical job in 90 degree heat) feel sick, almost passed out many times. This is when the weight all dropped.

Its never enough. I lost all the weight i gained and im still not happy with my body. Ive maintained the same range for a few months now. I refuse to eat over a certain amount or certain foods. A coworker bought us all lunch today and i got a burrito. It came with chips and a cookie. I ate the burrito, i was starving, felt terribly guilty about it, and hid the cookie and chips. Another coworker gave me a candy bar which i also hid. I ate too much during the day at work so i cant eat a proper dinner. I got a promotion and dont work a physical job anymore, so i have been putting on a few pounds. This scares the heck out of me and i feel gross. I try to cut back down on the eating so im only eating what im burning off without activity but when i fail i feel awful. Im even thinking of coming in at 3am to do the physical job, and go to my normal desk job from 7-5 just to keep the weight down and my arms toned.

I started taking a diet pill designed to make me feel full so i wont eat as much during the day. It makes my stomach hurt really bad. I dont want this to get worse, i dont want to gain weight but i dont want to be sick either. I cant afford therapy or any sort of help until my new insurance kicks in (i just moved out of state) probably in January. What can i do until then? Im trying so hard to eat healthier, to eat what my BMR is, but i feel terrible turning down other people's offers of food and cant eat out unless i plan all day for it. I hate feeling this way. I dont want to be the way i was again, at 14 or 19.

This afternoon, when eating lunch, I remembered that I was eating and it nearly made me sick.

It was just a piece of leftover chicken, nothing special, but biting into it I could feel the grease, the texture, the disgusting sensation of it being masticated in my mouth like I'm some fucking animal. And I looked down and felt a surge of nausea. I wanted to throw up at the sound of my chewing, the taste of the food.

This has been going on for nearly a year, now. A downhill battle, one that's hard to fight.

Because I want to gain muscle and look stronger, look like a guy rather than a round blob that I see in the mirror. And it's hard to grow muscle without protein, without food. Yet, I just...don't want to eat. I've started counting calories not just for the sake of avoiding overeating (which I have a tendency to do) but to also make sure I'm eating enough (which I also have a tendency to do).

Every day, it gets easier to convince myself that I shouldn't eat anything, that the cramping and the pain of no food is good, that it feels good. Because it does. And because if I don't eat, I'll get thinner, I'll look better. As far as support goes, family...doesn't get it.

have a friend that I met at the start of freshman year of college, when she was pretty overweight. Over the course of that year, she lost a lot of weight through dieting and tons of cardio, and ended around the cusp of underweight. We’re in our senior year now, and she has gained a little bit of the weight back but is still very much at a healthy weight.

The thing is, the way she talks about food/eats makes me worried that she has an eating disorder. She typically only eats once a day- when we go out to eat, she doesn’t like going out too early because it means that she’ll be hungry for the rest of the day, and she doesn’t like going out too late because she’ll get too hungry beforehand. I know that it’s not just a habit of intermittent fasting because sometimes she’ll talk about how she’s hungry, but won’t let herself eat because she already ate enough for the day (as described by her, not me).

She also talks about having to “earn” her food; she often brings up how she can’t eat xyz unless she goes to the gym for a certain amount of time beforehand, or if she eats “too much” accidentally, she “makes up” for it by exercising more later.

I know that it’s not super serious since she’s not like skipping days of eating or purging food, but at the very least it feels like she has a pretty unhealthy relationship with food.

She definitely doesn’t think there’s any problem just based off the way she talks about eating- we’re all college students so our eating habits in general are erratic, but she talks about skipping a meal while hungry to avoid weight gain in the way that we talk about skipping a meal when we don’t have time to eat, which I don’t think is very comparable at all.

Anyway, I don’t know what I should do in this situation, or whether I should do anything at all. I’ve probed at it a little bit before but she got defensive so I didn’t continue. A bunch of us in the friend group have mental health issues like depression/anxiety , and we kinda split ourselves by “normal” and “mentally ill” (I’m in the latter if it matters), but she firmly considers herself as one of the “normals” and that she’s completely fine, so a therapist or psychologist is very much not an option in the near future.

I obviously can’t force her to go to one, so is there anything that I should be saying/doing, or should I just let her be since her physical health seems fine at least?","Request: I think my friend has an eating disorder, what should/can I do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/q9cquu/request_i_think_my_friend_has_an_eating_disorder/,1634414965,16-10-21 9:09

Having no desire to eat often makes me forget about needing to. Usually I procrastinate eating until my body motivates me, but if I plan to be mobile I will in advance eat what I would've normally had later in the day.

I don't count calories but I know I don't consume anywhere near the recommended daily amount. I don't eat meals, only servings of snack foods (like a couple of nature valley bars or a yogurt) because they are easy/quick.

I think I still experience the common signs of hunger but became accustom to them. In general I feel fine, or maybe I'm just unbothered by the things I experience as a result of under-eating. After going for too long without responding to my body's requests for food, it'll motivate me to eat by inducing sudden nausea that causes involuntary gaging/dry heaving. It's pretty brief and I lay down for a couple minutes to make it subside before I finally eat something.

I was able to figure out that in these 4 months I've lost xx lbs (a lot). I was a little bit overweight before (I'm around 5ft9/5ft10) but I didn't have a problem with my body image, nor do I now. It surprised me when I did the math and found out how much weight I had lost. Especially because I haven't noticed a big change in my appearance and no one else has mentioned it to me.

I know that physically there's nothing causing this because I had a blood test and urinalysis in early September (for an unrelated reason). I was told all the results came back normal but the doctor didn't elaborate past that.

I'm not completely sure what I'm looking for by posting this. I guess maybe suggestions, hopefully ones other than the obvious ""just eat."" I haven't talked to anyone about this and I don't even really know what ""this"" is. Based on the information I've read from reputable and up to date health resources, I'm not sure that I have an eating disorder because my experience didn't line up with any of the different forms that were listed.

I’m a 36 year old woman in a high stress environment that is both emotionally and mentally draining. I have a fair bit of training in therapeutic models, such as Motivational Interviewing, Strength Based Problem Solving and work with individuals at creating safety. My problem is that I don’t know how to ask for help, and feel a bit of shame and embarrassment around my suspected ED. I have not been formally diagnosed with anything as I have not sought help, but my eating habits are problematic and likely akin to EDNOS. I do not binge, but will often purge after meals I deem “too much”, although there is no method/reasoning behind what I deem “too much”.

This has been pretty consistent for the last 7 years, although I did struggle with similar behaviours while in high school, which I did not seek help for either and just stopped (although I cannot state the reasoning for stopping or what worked to help me stop). My concern is I have been with my husband for 8 years and have been engaging in this problematic behaviours for the majority of it. I am able to hide these behaviours very well and he has no idea.

Right now I'm trying to continue with my diet and I usually crave the normal healthy food that I know that I like, but while I'm eating it feels disgusting. Even if I recognize the good flavor it's hard for me to chew it because I feel like I want to put it back on the plate. This happens with fast food too so I really can't say for sure if I wanted it so bad, because it tastes really gross.

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and twelve sessions of tDCS during six visits over two weeks. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home–no in-person visits are required.

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

I'm wanting some general advice on if there is anything more I can do to support my wife with her eating disorder. We have reached a stage in our relationship where we are wanting to start a family, however, unfortunately she is not ovulating due to her weight and the amount of exercise she does. I can't begin to imagine what it's like for her trying to deal with things and I've done my best over the years to try get a better understanding through research, books and talking things through with her.

I have found it incredibly difficult to feel of any use to her because of how defensive she can be and how much she pushes me away when I feel like all I am doing is trying to be supportive. She has refused to see a professional due to past experiences and while I beleive she would really benefit from it I respect it's ultimately her choice. We have tried working through some ED workbooks and while this occasionally seemed to result in productive conversations it also caused arguments at other times, between us we made the decision for me to take a step back and let her try to tackle things on her own. I felt like while I wanted to sit and talk things through she seemed to want to find something to argue with me about to the point where she just made things up I hadn't done.

She has taken on a new diet plan from the PT at the gym she goes to and I am proud of her for taking these steps. So far though she has actually lost weight since starting it and I find it difficult to keep my positivity up. I'm extremely worried that in order for her to gain weight the adjustments to her diet and exercise routine will be far too difficult for her to take on alone.

Unfortunately I can see resentment starting to build up on both sides of the relationship. For me when I see her leave the house to exercise every day it causes me to feel deflated. I think for her I'm the one person ""getting in the way"" so to speak of her ED behaviour and the ED being allowed to do what it wants for an easy life if that makes sense.

I’m 24 and got diagnosed as prediabetic a bit over two months ago. I’m 5’1 and was formerly 163 lbs but after calorie restriction and exercise I’ve gone to 145 in 2 months.

a lot of the time I don’t even eat X calories (low) and when I see anything I deem “fattening” I start feeling really anxious and my heart almost pounds. I’ve always been overweight so I think this kinda precludes me from having anorexia or something although I’ve always been a binge eater.

i don’t like people seeing me eat bad food and so I avoid eating much at work and because I work late I end up not eating much at all. for example it’s night time and I’ve had about 300 calories today.

another thing is that if I mess up, I punish myself. For example on Tuesday I drank alcohol and then ate a bag of chips. so I’m staying under Y (even lower) for the rest of the week because I hate myself for doing that.

this is working for my weight loss and if anything I’m more energetic than I was before so i don’t think it’s disordered otherwise I’d have bad side affects and also I have only been doing this for 2 months.

A message of hope for those feeling hopeless…. I've had a lifetime struggle with food. It gives me ease and comfort &amp; I use and abuse it. I try compensatory methods to then control my weight - excessive exercise, restrict, etc. I sometimes wake up and my first thoughts are on food or I dream about food. I'd have thoughts of eating a particular something when i wasn't even hungry. I'd want to just ""munch/eat"" something when anxious and wanting to avoid facing life/reality/my uncomfortable feelings. My closet was full of various sizes because my weight was always a moving target. It was a vicious cycle of using food to feel better - feeling awful afterwards, swearing off and coming up with a new plan to eat healthy, I'd have great results for a time, eventually I'd compulsively eat, after i was baffled how could i do this yet again. All the self-knowledge of nutrition &amp; strategies to eat right and exercise didn't work. All the years of ED disorder therapy didn't work. I tried umpteen other things: popular weigh &amp; pay programs, intuitive eating, other forms of talk therapy, hypnosis, various healing energy modalities, positive intentions/affirmations, metaphysical means like healing crystals, on and on. What did all this experience show me? That I'm screwed between the ears when it comes to managing my eating and my weight. Sure i could power through and have great results for a time (people would think I had surgery because of how different I looked) overtime, however I'd eventually go back to my compulsive eating behaviors. Finally, when I realized I was out of options and baffled I tried the last house on the block, a 12-step program for my compulsive eating problem. In the rooms i heard people share and I realized i wasn't alone in how I used food to feel better yet my mind and behavior with it was overtaking &amp; ruining my life. I was plagued with thoughts on what to eat, oh, no i can't eat that, ok, how do i avoid eating that because if I start I’ll eat too much, controlling ingredients…. then overeating and eventually compulsively eating. The big book of AA as adapted for my problem says I have a mind that is unmanageable. I can't “manage the decision” to stop compulsively eating for good and all. How did I know this? My experience proved it. I could have all the reasons to stop (serious health reasons, self-knowledge about myself &amp; exploring “why I eat” through therapy, self-knowledge of nutrition &amp; exercise strategies, job expectations to model good health, etc) was that enough to stop me for good and all - Nope! I got free from my constant obsessive thoughts around food, eating and weight by joining a 12-step program for compulsive eating. I got a sponsor and worked the steps. By doing that I am now free from compulsive food thoughts and the insane behaviors that would follow. Now, I get freedom from that barrage of food thoughts and weight obsession. Now i have a different way of dealing with life. Rather than turning to the food I turn to the steps, but i had to do the work and get through the steps to be able to start living life that way.

I'm a trans woman and have been on HRT for almost three months, and am considered a healthy weight. Despite this, I've been skipping meals with what's becoming an increasing frequency lately - I haven't eaten breakfast 3 of the past 4 days and haven't eaten lunch 2 of the past 4. I'm a college student, and while part of it is simply forgetting as part of a busy life and being on the go a lot, I'm noticing that there's also some self-image problems as part of it as well. I get misgendered pretty frequently due to being early in my transition and have some bad acne issues, and it really wears on me. Part of my anxiety is feeling that I'm too big to pass and need to be smaller to pass as a woman better, so therefore I need to eat less so there's less of me, and I need to eat better (I feel ashamed when I eat fried things/fast food) or else my face will have acne and I'll hate it since it will have been my fault.

i am going to a concert that means the world to me in december and am fixated on looking ""good"" for it. when i was healthier in march-april, it became my summer goal was to put on some pounds to finally be a healthy, normal weight for my height. i achieved it and am now 5 ft 5 in and the heaviest i've been in my life, but still on the side of underweight to normal on the bmi chart. i feel huge, bloated, unhealthy. i see cellulite on my legs and i feel gassy all the time. i eat really healthy on the overall (save for going out and eating with friends and indulging). i have already started noticing myself counting calories, obsessively measuring my waistline, skipping my meals.

I do get, to a certain extent, why they want to and what they are doing (I used to sh and restrict very often, but I've been able to step away from the habits after a while- I won't pretend like I've been involved to the extent that they are though). They really don't care if they live and I don't want to make this into a ""woe me"" when I don't have to go through the struggles that they do, it is very very difficult watching them be hurt- hurting themselves and eachother. I want to help, and I'm trying to by just being there for them but I can't help but to feel so upset that all I can really do right now is watch as they slowly traumatise themselves or even slowly end their own lives. I don't know what to do at all. Maybe I'm some idealistic kid who think that there has to be a solution to everything, but I really do want there to be something I can do. One of them has a terrible home life and is in a poor financial situation so I'm hesitant to tell a teacher for that could complicate things for her or she might not even be able to afford help. I also worry that, even if that wasn't the case, she would leave 'help' going back to her habits again. Doing this might make it a 'sure fact' for her and prevent her from getting better in the future by herself. I do not know what to do at all. The school's known that she once would sh and once would restrict her eating, so she goes to therapy now, but it seems like it's done nothing. I asked another friend of ours who I believe to be really logical and level-headed and she told me that we can't do anything.

I'm probably so selfish for saying this, but I genuinely don't know how I can watch them deteriorate. But I can't leave them by themselves either. What do I do?

One of my biggest struggles with trying to stop my disordered eating habits was kicking my habit of counting calories/ other nutritional information numbers. I've spent the past 5 years practicing not allowing myself to read any nutrition facts at all and trying to be kinder to myself about eating ""junk"" food or unhealthy meals. It has really helped, and for the past 3 years I've finally been able to maintain a healthy BMI.

So it's been pretty difficult for me to wrap my head around the news from my doctor that my cholesterol levels are very high and that I have to make dietary changes to lower it -- I'm in my 20s so she was not too keen to put me on medication for lowering my cholesterol yet. All of the stuff online I've found about making this lifestyle change has been making me crazy. Diet plans with the caloric intake of every meal and snack accounted for, suggestions for low  calorie/day diets... honestly my worst nightmare after working so hard and for so long to avoid getting into bad habits like this again.

I have a friend who suffered from anorexia in her teens. She herself admitted this. Back then, she looked very skinny, but could still pass off as just being very underweight and 'somewhat' healthy. She recovered and has been doing well for about 5 years now. A few months ago, I saw her and she's back at the same weight as she was in her teens. Alarm bells start ringing. I only tried to gently approach the topic about her losing too much weight, but she cheerily brushed it off saying that she's eating enough, but doing a lot more workouts as she's bored because of the pandemic. Today, I saw her on social media and she's the skinniest I have ever seen her. There is no question that she has relapsed. I'm talking 5' 6"" and less than X lbs (very underweight BMI) Everyone is concerned about her, but we are very hesitant to reach out to her in fear that she won't take it too well if we say the wrong thing.

She says it is hard to eat more than that and it’s hard to want to eat in general because her body physically doesn’t want the food. If she were to eat more, she gets nauseous and feels sick. It is tricky to explain but she says it’s always been hard to eat because of how picky she is, but it’s worse now because in order to eat it feels her body will cooperate only with very certain meals that she usually doesn’t know off the top of her head. I know for the lack of how much she eats for these past months that she has to be severely lacking in a lot of nutrients and minerals. She said, to quote “it feels like she is slowly decomposing everyday and cannot do anything about it.”

When I do feel anxious about what I eat, I hate being in my skin and the thought of eating and having something in my stomach makes me panic. I hate it. I’ve noticeably cut back my daily food intake, but I still eat “normally”.

&amp;#x200B;

I have lost X amount of weight in a few months and seeing the numbers go down brings me so much joy. But, when it doesn’t constantly go down/goes back up I get panicky and really distraught. I consider it progress lost. But mainly, I’m worried about how bloated my stomach looks. If it looks like what I consider big, I immediately think about how I need to cut my food the next day to make up for it. If my stomach looks small, I will be happy and joyful the rest of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve also started keeping track of what I eat in a day, but don’t really worry about calories that much. If I eat little, I’m super proud of myself. When I eat a lot, I think I’m failure, and it’s hard to get the guilt and thoughts out of my way.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, when I weigh myself, I think the scale lies to me and that I’m really heavier than what it says. Sorry this is a lot, it’s just my friends say I have a ED but I don’t think this is a problem. I don’t think Anything I’m doing is bad. Even if it is, it could be much worse.

2676,EDPostRequests,1635676335,qjmuh6,"Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve recently been having trouble with feeling hungry and if I was hungry I couldn’t eat nearly as much as I used to. If I tried to eat as much as before then I’d get uncomfortably full. It started about this time last year and I thought it was just a weird off chance thing due to the stress of everything going on. Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays and I was so upset that I couldn’t eat a lot. My parents encouraged me to go to a doctor and she ran some blood tests but everything came back normal. I just kind of shrugged it off but it’s getting worse.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I have three alarm on my phone to remind me to eat and I only really feel hungry first thing in the morning and it’s more of an annoying ache then the usual distracting roar. If I turn off the alarm and get distracted I will forget to eat and then I’ll feel a brain fog and kind of dizzy. Once I get to that point, I’ll realize I need to eat and have a power bar or something. If I wait too long then I might mess up my lunch and if I try to eat my lunch then it feels like I’m already full and I’m forcing myself to eat more, but I know if I don’t eat my lunch then I’ll get woozy again, so I just power through it and try my best. Dinner is a crap shoot. Sometimes I force myself to eat it, sometimes I just don’t have the willpower to force myself, and sometimes I’m hungry and I’ll eat. It’s kind of embarrassing and people have made comments about it’s weird that I forget to eat or I eat so little. I also socially eat even if I’m not hungry so if my roommate is home and she makes dinner then I’ll eat with her as well even though I’m not hungry. I also really enjoy going out to restaurants with friends and trying new things.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I brought this about because I started intermittent fasting in 2019 and skipped breakfast but ate my other meals and snacks. I was on the verge of obese and I started to exercise 3 times a week for about an hour or hour and a half but I wasn’t very religious with it. Also, I’d go on hikes because I’ve found being outside and walking is just good for my mental health. I lost weight and now I’m firmly in the overweight category and my weight has not moved since early this year which adds to the frustration of not losing weight but also not eating.

&amp;#x200B;

I also noticed that I can’t emotionally eat anymore either. So before I’d be really upset and just eat a bunch of junk food but now I get 3 bites in and I just can’t finish it. I have to psych myself up to eat. Every meal is like cajoling a child to eat their vegetables and it’s so defeating to look in the fridge and see foods that I used to love and just feel absolutely nothing about them. Occasionally I’ll get a craving and I’ll immediately eat whatever I want even if it’s not really the right meal for the time of day. I’m the queen of pancakes for dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I’ve started a new position which requires long hours and lots of brain power and it’s really stressed me out and put even more of dampener on my appetite. I’ve looked online and they say stress can ruin appetites but this has been going on for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I’m saying all of this because I want to know if I’ve given myself an eating disorder and what steps I can take to fix myself. I’m so unhappy right now.",Request: what steps I can take to fix myself,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/qjmuh6/request_what_steps_i_can_take_to_fix_myself/,1635697935,31-10-21 5:32
2677,EDPostRequests,1635676266,qjmtxm,"So I've requested a post here before asking if I had an eating disorder as I was unsure, I experienced wanting to starve myself and making it a goal of mine to become underweight etc I was really restrictive with my eating for about 2 months and I believe these feelings had came up due to what was going on in my personal life, everything was spiralling out of control and I guess I restricted my eating to gain some of that control back?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway fast forward to the start of October and things start to ease up and the personal issues start to get resolved, I start eating a little more than I did and I start snacking more too.

&amp;#x200B;

For a while I'd say I had reached a nice and healthy relationship with food and didn't have any bad or good foods and just let myself eat what I wanted and when I wanted. But this sort of thing also began to spiral because I found myself eating more and more sugary food or fast food/take outs than actual meals, like I'd replace a bowl of cereal or a slice of toast with a box of chocolates. Instead of having dinner I buy lots of sugary and sweet food and eat it all.

&amp;#x200B;

It's almost like I've went from wanting control to absolutely no control! I don't want to get too specific with what I eat in a day now but to summarise it: I have no control on how much I eat, I don't know when to stop and I eat just for the sake of eating.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't want to seem like someone who's like ""omg I love pizza, it's all eat!!! 🤪"" because its more than just having preference on food, I'm genuinely worried about my health so I started to buy only cereal bars and fruit to make these never ending snacking sprees healthier but because it's not what my body seems to want it just stays there until its out of date, I can't even force it.

&amp;#x200B;

If the food my body is craving isn't there then I just won't eat, but when it is there I will eat with no control or hold back.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems I go through two extremes, I either starve myself for months or I binge for months - and of course neither are healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm kind of looking to find if anyone else is in a similar situation with going through two extremes, I can't seem to reach that healthy medium.",request: Binge eating after starving for months?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/qjmtxm/request_binge_eating_after_starving_for_months/,1635697866,31-10-21 5:31
2678,EDPostRequests,1635676208,qjmtf6,"I (17F) was never been considered “skinny” growing up. As a child I was always average to slightly above average weight. During the beginning of Covid I put on a couple more pounds, but I didn’t care. I never really cared about my weight and had an okay relationship with food. In the past year I moved across the country; while settling in I fell into a bit of a depression and started loosing my appetite. This has gone on for months and I no longer enjoy eating. Resulting in xx amount of weight to lost, a noticeable difference on my 5’1ft frame. I wouldn’t say I have a problem with my body image, but acknowledge I can make more healthy decisions to improve it. What I do struggle with is wanting to eat. I live in a household with my grandparents who have early dementia causing the kitchen to be infested with fruit flies because they have a habit of leaving food out. To be short, it grosses me out and makes me nauseous, making my appetite decrease even more. I also struggle with taking time to eat; I don’t really feel hunger often and when I do, I don’t make it a priority to fix. And to be completely honest, am aware of my bad eating habits and want to improve them, but most importantly I want stop these bad habits before it starts to overwhelm/take-over. A lot of my (female) family members have struggled with EDs (along with depression/anxiety/bipolar/etc) and I know how hard it was for them to recover.

TW: I mention BED, weight and food.

I'm sure you guys deal with hundreds of messages a day so I'll keep it brief.

I'm a gay caucasian guy turning 20 this December (2021), living in South Africa. Weight has yoyo'd my entire life but for the most part I've been overweight. Right now, I'm the heaviest I've been.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have an unhealthy relationship with food, and have never been diagnosed, but I'm sure I have developed a form of binge eating disorder. I've written a meal plan for myself and will do the shopping for it this weekend so that I may begin to use it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for a service (possibly subscription-based) in which I can directly message someone any time I'm having a bad time and want to binge, which is often. I would need this person to be available literally 24/7/365, especially at impractical hours.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if a service such as this exists, but if you can think of anything/anyone, please let me know.

Thank you kindly for reading.
