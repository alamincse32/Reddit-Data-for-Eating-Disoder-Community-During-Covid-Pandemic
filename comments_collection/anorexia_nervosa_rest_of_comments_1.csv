1,al0ofm,5thmeta_tarsal,1548877591.0,2019-01-30 13:46:31,"I’d say the whole “getting back to normal” thing can take months. Once I got past the sick full feeling, I felt extremely empty. Insatiable hunger that led me to just keep eating and eating. It took a bit for me to get back to a “normal” weight despite technically over-eating. When in recovery you may enter this, also referred to as extreme hunger or a spike in metabolism. Don’t worry, you are not going from restricting to binging, your body is dealing with the stress of starvation mixed with the reintroduction of food. This probably happened for me after a month or so.

Before that, I experienced what you did. It’s a few things. First, your digestion has been used to working at an extremely slow pace. This is why digestion during the reintroduction of normal amounts of food is wacky, and you can end up with loose BMs and undigested food, not to mention discomfort. Think of it as a car starting up and getting ready to drive after being in a garage for years. 

Second, your metabolism has adjusted itself from starving. It’s conserving energy because it’s used to not receiving adequate amounts. As such, a normal meal can feel monstrous from the fact that your stomach has shrunk (organ), and you may sweat and feel hot due to the sudden increase in metabolic activity. Your metabolism has to kick in more in order to make use of and process the normal amount of energy you’re eating. 

Third, the mental aspect of it plays a big role. Depending on how long you’ve been restricting, your brain is probably used to perceiving normal portions as monstrous, because it’s become accustomed to inadequate portions. This can leave you feeling like you’re eating much more than a normal amount. 

Best of luck to you, and I promise the physical discomfort DOES get better and eventually disappears. You got this! ❤️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You could have dangerous electrolyte shits, digestive issues, and fluid retention issues. You will need a medical doctor to monitor all these things for you.

4,ayne9o,19apricots,1552175706.0,2019-03-09 17:55:06,"Remind yourself that this isn't your fault really and you be got to take baby steps. There's so much guilt and self hate and cycling here that it feels impossible to sort out one thing when there's so much to sort out. Firstly, I'd go to a therapist. Go with the intention of not ""fixing"" yourself next that can be very exhausting especially when it doesn't work every time because it won't. Go with the thought, I'm here just to vent and I'm here for myself and I'm here to get myself a better future. Small steps are hard when you're holding so much in about so much. The fact that no one has noticed doesn't mean no one would care. In most people's heads it's either like they're not specifically paying attention or they just think you're getting healthy because that's what they associate running and working out with. Letting people know is hard and it feels like there's a lot of consequences to it so having essentially a stranger to talk to is good. Breaking the cycle routine is hard but my advice for that is to start by varying other things in your week. Plan to go places even if it is by yourself. Go shopping or to the cinema. See your friends and go for walks and just simple things that break up your day and seeing people more forces you to think differently about things. The last tip I have is super cheesy but I've started to do it recently and am now less visually disgusted when I see myself ahha. Jk. Every time I see a mirror in my house or before I put on my makeup I say ""I'm beautiful, I'm confident"" and then wack on my fuck you on Spotify and everything feels good even if it's just for a bit. Listen to music or do art, take your mind off food and tell yourself you're worth it. Because you are.",yoyogorl,1554444371.0,2019-04-05 01:06:11,"Thank you for your help but I honestly see no way to get help. I’m fasting right now and no one notices but my parents would never believe me if I told them I had an eating disorder, I once brought it up to my mom and she laughed and said I didn’t. I know I do otherwise I wouldn’t be forcing myself to go through what I have been doing for the last few years. My boyfriend tries to slow me down and keep me from pushing myself too hard but I lie to him so he won’t worry and stay up till 3am on school nights working out in my room sometimes.
