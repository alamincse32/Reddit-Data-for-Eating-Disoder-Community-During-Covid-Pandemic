0,82qztc,What should I do if I just accidentally found a note by my 22-year-old sister saying she’s anorexic and hates herself?,"I admit I read her diary which didn’t look like a diary. I’m 25 and my sister is 22. She’s an overachiever in everything. She’s also very confident, sociable and has the best physique around (tall, hourglass and slim).  I’m so shocked that she wrote she’s going anorexic “again” because she hates her body and has stopped eating. I didn’t even know she was once anorexic although she was terribly thin as a teenager! What should I do? Really freaking out because it’s so unlike her and I’m so worried about her.

3,842xs8,Help- maybe... idk,"For the past 2 years, I’ve been restricting my eating. Most days, I go the entire day without eating until I can’t resist to binge eating after school. I’m stuck right now. If I eat, I feel like absolute crap. Even when i don’t eat, I feel so bad about myself because I’m not making any progress. The longest I’ve gone without eating is 3.5 days and my weight has stayed almost the same for the past 2 years (maybe a 10 lb difference at most). The only changes I’ve noticed is that I’m always cold, my skin is purple, and my heart rate is low. I’ve never purged but I’m seriously considering it. I’m extremely depressed and I look up suicide videos, sad videos, sad music, etc. to try and make myself more depressed. I want to be anorexic so bad because it’s the only thing that gives me a purpose. I read stories of people who were put into inpatient and get jealous that they got so bad that someone had to intervene and put them in a hospital when all I can do is keep trying and failing. I’m really messed up, but I don’t want help. I only want to get worse. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t want to talk to anyone or see a doctor or even try to make myself better.

4,85zo71,From binge eating to restricting,"Let me start by saying it’s not his fault. I have a significant other who’s strictly dated thinner women. I’m 5’7” and I started at 167. I noticed that after my dad died I binge ate everything in sight after giving up alcohol as a crutch. When he died and I was 24 I had just given birth to my daughter. I bounced back. Introducing food to make me feel “good” in 2015/16 I ate everything in front of me. My body changed so slowly I couldn’t recognize I’d went from 140-170 lbs. My boyfriend mentioned, you’re looking a little unhealthy. I started noticing things. My thighs, my lower tummy. When I washed my upper arms there was a flap there. I’ve been restricting for a month and I came here to see if it was healthy. I feel unhealthy, but I don’t want to develop another unhealthy way to remedy my sadness. I’ve lost 13 lbs in 1 month. There’s probably nothing wrong with me. I am a bigger girl and so keeping an eye on my intake is probably a good idea. The only disclaimer I have is that my hair is falling out.

11,89uae9,The Green Institute; A five-day intensive eating disorder program in June 2018. Women only.,"The Institute integrates the leading research-based treatment approaches in a group therapy model for women 15 and older.  The program aims to create an engaged atmosphere where patients learn the causes and consequences of eating disorders from trained facilitators.  During the five days, group members will focus on learning to recognize and refute sociocultural forces which promote thinness and emphasize appearance.  The program encourages a focus on pursuing a healthy ideal, as opposed to the thin ideal.  The Green Institute works with patients to develop an individualized program to define and foster their own pursuit of the healthy ideal.

The Institute will be held at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa.  The program will be from Monday, June 4th, 2018 to Friday, June 8th, 2018.  The program consists of 30 hours of treatment offered from 9 am - 4 pm daily with a one-hour lunch break.

16,8aidby,The simple things when recovering make me want to relapse.,"So, this is more of a personal thing to post when I'm thinking of relapsing and to tell myself that I need to continue the recovery process. First, can I say I've had an off-and-on relationship with my eating disorder for 4 years. I'm 4'9, 17 years old and my highest recorded weight is 140LBS and my lowest weight recorded was 85LBS. I'm currently 90LBS.


Normal, daily life that bothers me with my eating disorder;


1) The color of my urine during the recovery process is dark. I'm use to having little to no color in my urine when I use the bathroom.

2) Having to go #2 on a weekly basis. This is strange to me because I'm so use to having a problem with not being able to poop for weeks at a time.

3) Being praised for eating hurts me a lot. I'm so use to people not caring when I eat or how much I eat because ""It's a lost cause"".

4) My significant other get's easily bothered by how often I eat small meals. Eating a series of small meals per day to get to a calorie count of anything over 300 is hard enough, but his pessimism makes it harder since I do manage to eat anywhere between 150-700 per day. This is a lot more than I use to, but he insists on me continue to increase that number per week.

5) Trying to hide or lower my anxiety when I make a meal or eat anything is slowly getting more difficult. I can't explain why it makes me anxious or why it happens in the first place, let alone trying to voice that anxiety.

6) Talking about it makes me think about it more. It's easier to eat when I'm distracted by things that have nothing to do with food or myself.

7) Trying not to remember the specific calories whenever I pick something up to eat or looking at what others are eating is more difficult than I'd imagine. My first though is to imagine how many calories are in everything, so trying to look at it as food and not a failure is very difficult.

8) Being told I need to be okay with gaining weight is hard to understand. I'm at a healthy weight, but it's insisted that if I ate a ""healthy amount"" that I would naturally gain weight. That I can understand, but I can't understand why I ""have"" to gain weight. I'm comfortable with where I am, and I want to maintain here. Why do I have to force myself to be uncomfortable? I'm working on a plan that will let me eat more without gaining the weight. Exorcise and healthy food are mandatory and to raise one, I have to raise the other. Why is that bad?

Yeah, sorry for the rant but It's just a small list of daily life I have a hard time coping with. Feel free to comment and make your own, because this honestly made me feel a bit more open about what I'm willing to change about my eating habits in order to be healthy.

23,8g3dwi,Stomach problems,"Didn’t know what community to post this to, so I apologize in advance, but I have been suffering from constant stomach problems for years I have not been able to determine wether they are psychological or real, but my suspicion is that it is a little bit of both. I am not delusional, I am fully aware that I’m skinny and need to eat, so I do not believe I am suffering from anorexia, but I believe I may have an eating disorder. My hope is that someone may be experiencing the same problems or could possibly know where I can go for help. The most I’ve ever weighed is about 118lbs. At my worst I was 5’5” and weighed about 90 pounds. I’m a 23 year old male. I’ve always been skinny, but over the last few years my stomach problems have gotten worse. Every time I try to eat, I get full extremely fast, within a few bites of food, have difficulty swallowing, and lately every time I eat I feel nauseated immediately after only eating a few bites of food. I always feel like I have to throw up but I never do. It has only actually made me vomit a couple of times. Every time I eat even a small amount of food, I feel extremely sick for a few minutes. I become overheated, extremely anxious, and I run to the sink to splash cold water on myself. It has gotten worse and worse and my doctors cannot find anything wrong with me. I did have a hernia in my esophagus, and doctors believe that I used to have a stomach ulcer because I had vomited blood once in the past. I used to deal with extremely bad diarrhea on a regular basis but that has at least subsided for now. Today it is 5pm and I have not eaten a single thing because I am terrified my symptoms will start again and I do not know what to do. I am extremely hungry, but I know that eating will make me sick. My weight has dropped from 118 to probably below 110 in just the last few days because I am terrified of eating. I would appreciate any advice someone may have. I do drink protein shakes, as sometimes it is so bad that liquid calories are the only thing I can consume. But lately even the liquid protein shakes are making me sick and I am afraid to drink them now. I’m hoping someone can point me in the direction of a place I can go where I can determine if this is all psychological or if I really do have a physical health concern. I have starved myself for so long that I am afraid I will become sick every time I try to eat now.

26,8fa0xf,I think I’m finally able to admit I am to some extent.,"Recently I read somewhere about how anorexia is defined by not having an appetite. If this is correct to some end, then it means I’ve been anorexic most of my life on and off. But mostly on. 

I don’t have an appetite. And when I do it’s not great. I don’t want to be thin. I have no delusions of myself being overweight. And I’m sorry if I’ve misjudged this condition, because I’ve just never identified myself as such because I truly WANT to gain weight. I don’t portion my food or choose to not eat. I forget. Or I just don’t feel hungry. And when I try to eat sometimes I have to force myself, till I begin to feel nauseated. For some reason I can’t seem to ever finish the last bite of anything in most all cases. It’s super rare I finish my meal. 

I admit my diet in general is not great. I’m hypoglycemic and have anxiety which is a terrible combination. I don’t take meds for the anxiety because I can’t handle hormones. I tend to have opposite effects; like getting pregnant on birth control, more than once. I had a doctor tell me that about 1% of people actually become MORE fertile from birth control. And not only that the hormones, even low dose, causes me terrible depression. So I’ve been advised to stay away from hormonal medication all together. 

Only thing that helps my apatite is cannabis. But I try not to be reliant on it. But when stress is high, and strapped for money, it’s nothing I can afford anyhow and it just makes things worse. Can’t afford good food, can’t afford the medicine to help me eat food I can’t afford either. 

I’ve pretty much always been teetering on the edge of anorexia most all my life. People will make comments about me being thin. It’s hurtful. It’s hurtful to me as much as it’s hurtful for someone to be called fat. It’s worse in some ways because people will say things like, “You’re so lucky to be so thin. I wish I had your metabolism.” (Which also happens to be super fast as things that make others gain weight will make me loose weight, like foods high in sugar, which I’m supposed to limit anyhow.)

They think they are complimenting me. But they aren’t at all. I’ve had to explain too many times to people how they don’t what my eating problems. And typically they don’t even understand at all and treat me like I’m being dramatic. 

I always feel so alone in how I am. I don’t want this. I want to be able to sit down without my tailbone hurting on a hard surface. I want my clothes to fit right again. I just want to feel healthy again. 

The only time I recall having a real apatite is when I was pregnant. It was almost magical. To desire food is something remarkable when I never had that before. Sadly this desire for food left after giving birth. And in knowing what I’ve been missing, the desire, makes me feel worse about it all. Before having kids I didn’t know the feeling of desire for food. I miss that desire. I miss the ability to eat and not feel like shit all the time.

One of the things I’ve noticed is that I’m losing sleep, I feel super hydrated, I’m feeling more angry. One of the biggest things is that before now, whenever I didn’t eat I always felt hunger pains, but now I forget to eat meals and then later I remember I forgot to eat, but I felt no hunger pains. I’m also losing hair. Not a lot but it’s coming out in small clumps. None of this used to happen before but I don’t know if it’s stress but I feel like it’s tied to my anorexia.

And you can't do it more than 1 week or you'll get sick. And even tho as it seems to you lose alot of weight. So do it maybe once a mounth idk but heres what you need to do 
For breakfast:
2 boiled egg
1 toast.
And don't forget to drink alot of water!!
For dinner 
2 boiled egg
1 toast
And 1 diet coke. Or coke 0 
And the last meal 
2 boiled egg again
And 1 toast 
And repeat it for 1 week. And i know what you thinking.. Why so many eggs..? Well it really helps to lose weight. And also while doing this you need to exercise min 1h a day. Well i mean 2. Because its 1h of cardio and the other its training. Thats why you have 1 toast. To have carbs and to give energy to work out.

I can never feel hungry and even when I force myself to eat, I simply cannot. Genetically, an eating disorder wouldn’t be unlikely. I’ve been feeling especially bad and the dysmorphia has been hitting especially bad lately. Today was my seven year old sister’s birthday and after eating half a burger, I had to force myself to swallow my throw up at the table so as not to make a scene. My body simply doesn’t want and rejects food, sometimes I just feel too sad to eat. I felt terrible for my body’s inability to simply eat.

65,8rgdi4,Reaching Out,"Hi all! This is my first ever visit to Reddit, and my first ever post on Reddit, because I hear the anorexia community is kinda bopping. Anyway, I'm not sure I'm anorexic. I only realized these things in the past few days. But like, I can't bring myself to eat a lot. I'm kind of obsessed with calories. I feel disgusting when I see that number rise above 800 or so. The past few days I've kinda forced myself up to 1100 or 1200, but I can't stand those numbers. And my friend tells me that those numbers are fine, and I'll definitely lose weight, and I could even stand to eat more and still lose weight. But I don't really care about losing weight. That's how things started, and why I originally started changing my diet, but I've moved past that. It's all about the numbers for me now. All I can seem to think about is that calorie number, and how sometimes I can't will my body to get anymore food because I'm focusing too much on how it will affect that number.

I'm not sure if this is some sort of introduction post, or if I'm looking for advice, or what. I guess I'm here because I've tried talking to other people in my life, but they don't seem to understand. And I know this isn't healthy (though I have one friend who's telling me it's perfectly healthy). And I feel like I should change things but I'm not sure how.

im really tempted to fall back into old habits... at least just long enough to lose the extra squish bc it makes me very uncomfortable and self conscious 

but im also afraid of two things : going back to the doctor and them realizing something is up again. and also not being able to stop and just keep losing and losing until im where i was before

98,8yhigx,My girlfriend,"My girlfriend has Anorexia Nervosa. It has been really difficult because her family does not seem to understand that what she is dealing with is actually dangerous. They chalk it up to just her being moody. So I am the only one who stays on top of her making sure she eats. But lately it has gotten worse. She used to love to cook, and eat, and she loves food. She has always been small, and relatively skinny, I dont think she has ever been over 110 lbs. Yet she sees herself as too fat now, and hates her body. She has severe anxiety and sometimes believes that I dont love her because she thinks there is no possible way for me to actually love her since she is so ugly in her own mind. It used to be that she would try to just eat really healthy and constantly excercise. She used to have some days where she wasn't as bad, or not bad at all, and could actually eat well. She doesn't have good days anymore. She fluctuates between being completely exhausted and depressed because of malnutrition and anxiety, and being angry at me for trying to get her to eat, to sobbing because she doesn't want to die and she feels like there is some part of her that is trying to kill her. She didn't want to drink water today because she was afraid it would make her bloated. It is almost impossible for me to get her to eat more than 1000 calories per day. It is a daily struggle and I don't see this getting easier soon. I am worried because I leave for school in a month and a half, but I am not sure that in that time her condition could improve to the point where I would feel comfortable not being around her. I am just asking for any help you can think to give. Whatever you think I should do.

115,94rde2,Eating Behaviour Research Survey,"Hello! 

I am a student at Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia. I’m currently undertaking a research project as part of a Bachelor of Psychological Science (Honours). I am investigating the factors involved in the development and maintenance of orthorexic and disordered eating behaviours (restrictive/binging/purging). The factors to be explored centre around issues of control (e.g. how comfortable or uncomfortable are you with feeling uncertain about life?). The significance of these factors in relation to each individual eating behaviour will be explored.

The study involves an online survey (average completion time is approximately just 15 mins) and everyone over the age of 18 (world wide) is welcome to participate!

All responses are completely anonymous and approval for this research has been granted by the Swinburne Human Research Ethics Committee (SUHREC) in line with the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines.

If you would like to help contribute to the research please follow the link:

Cheers!

(Please note: We are looking for participants across a range of eating behaviours. This includes orthorexic behaviour as well as other disordered eating behaviours (e.g. restrictive, binging/purging). So participants who engage in one of these behaviours or a combination of any of these behaviours are welcome. Additionally, those who don't display any of these such behaviours at all are also welcome to participate.)",1533470388,8/5/2018 6:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/94rde2/eating_behaviour_research_survey/,3

129,99ajzx,I can’t get diagnosed with an eating disorder even though I’m trying to get help,"At the start of college (17) I used to weigh over 200 lbs; not much, but enough. About a year ago I had a serious medical emergency and temporairily stopped eating because of it. That triggered an eating disorder I knew I would surface (or maybe resurface) eventually. Every time I eat I want to cry because I feel like every bite turns me into some kind of fat monster. I can go for days without eating anything and love it, I count my calories like crazy and get a rush when I eat under 1000 in a day. Sometimes I’ll get so hungry I binge and then feel so guilty I throw it all up.

I know my behavior is seriously unhealthy and toxic but I’ve tried getting help and none of my doctors listen to me. I lost about 50 lbs in four months or less and it’s still declining, albeit at a slower rate. The doctors asked me how I lost all the weight and I said I stopped eating. I told them I would go for days without food, and that I’d been throwing up almost any food I did consume. All they see though are my numbers going down on the scale, completely ignoring that I’m literally asking for help. One doctor told me to keep up the good work.

I’m almost 20 now and I know women have trouble getting doctors to actually listen to them when they say something about their own damn body, but I didn’t realize it would be like this.

130,996itq,The internet destroyed my self-esteem,"***TRIGGER WARNING: THIS POST MENTIONS SPECIFIC WEIGHTS***

I've always been unhappy with the size and shape of my body. Two years ago I started severely restricting my calorie intake and my weight dropped from 100 lbs to 85 lbs. At last, my thunder thighs and bulging belly was gone! I actually enjoyed going clothes shopping for once because everything looked great on me. Women constantly complimented me on my thinness. For the first time in my life I actually felt proud of my body. Unfortunately I was slowly starving myself to death.

My family urged me to get help. I went to a treatment center for three months and gained 25 lbs. Then I gained an additional 10 pounds after treatment, which was totally unnecessary, and it brought my weight up to an all-time high of 120 lbs. I absolutely HATE the way my body looks now. 

My wedding is coming up in two months. It's supposed to be the happiest day of my life, but all I can think about is how fat I'm going to look in my photos. Those photos are going to be permanent reminders of my poor planning and lack of discipline. I worked SO HARD to lose all of that weight and now that it counts I have nothing to show for it. :'(

Last weekend I went to the mall and bought myself a cute new outfit in hopes that it might help me feel a little better about myself. The outfit looked like something Lolita would wear so my fiance bought me a pair of heart-shaped glasses to go with it. Then he did a photo shoot with me and uploaded the photos on Imgur. That was a huge mistake. Within minutes I was informed that I'm fat, gross, and ""waaaaay too old"" to portray Lolita. One guy told me I'm so ugly I should kill myself. Thanks, Internet. I can't believe I actually had the audacity to feel good about myself. Good thing you put me back in my place.

I deleted the photos right away but the comments stuck with me. The next day I started dieting again. It started out innocently enough - cutting back on sugar, eating carrot sticks instead of chips, etc. Now it's gotten to the point where I'm eating nothing BUT fruits and vegetables. Last night I barely touched my dinner and my fiance told me he's starting to get concerned. He told me that my rib cage and hipbones are becoming more prominent, which only excites me and makes me want to lose more weight.

I thought I was fully recovered but I can feel the old ED symptoms creeping back into my life. I want to feel confident on my wedding day but I don't want to hurt my body in the process.

140,97szmt,My life has been going pretty shitty and I feel like I just want to relapse to my ED,"The last time a starved myself and purged was 2 years ago. I don't look it, I don't think my weight can be classified as anorexic/bulemic but I definitely feel like I have some kind of eating disorder. It was way worse when I was back in highschool, I managed to live off water for 3 days that one time. Anyway, I digress.

My family's going through one shitshow after another and I can't do this anymore. It's already bad that I'm fighting off a depressive relapse (I attempted 6 months ago and currently recovering) but I just totally snapped a while ago after an argument between my dad and I, nothing's going right anymore. I just wanna curl up in a ball and not do anything. I'm a fat, useless, good for nothing, piece of shit... and I deserve to die hungry. I hate myself so much and my current situation's making me hate myself even more.

I'm not asking for help because I want this to happen. I wanna go back to my old weight. I wanna look thin. I wanna look nice. I want to wear nice clothes. I tried making an effort the healthy way, and it didn't work. So I guess there's no harm in going back to my old ways.",1534431396,8/16/2018 9:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/97szmt/my_life_has_been_going_pretty_shitty_and_i_feel/,1

143,9apwu1,Can’t fight the thought that I did something wrong,"I’ve struggled with restricting and weight issues since I was 8, but I only more recently started calling it what it was, an eating disorder. I started trying to fix how I ate and how I dealt with food. I was always the type that was told I could eat anything without gaining a pound. Well, here I am about 8 months and 40lb later. 

I *know* I’m not fat. Even though that sounds like a TON of weight to gain, I’m at a BMI of 22. Normal. But I’ve been skinny for so long that I don’t know how to be okay with normal and I feel like even though I’ve taken myself to a more healthy weight and I’ve noticed I’m MUCH healthier than I used to be, I still feel like I did something wrong. 

One of the hardest parts of finally gaining some weight was everyone discouraged me. It doesn’t matter how thin you are, unless you’re on a feeding tube, people will discourage you from gaining any weight. I can’t stress enough how important it was to block those people out and distance myself from them, but even still I feel guilty.

I think part of this is because this weekend I went to wear a crop top I really liked that I just bought back in May, but it was too small and my fiancé mentioned none of my Fall2017 stuff would fit. So later that day I tried on my Fall stuff and everything but 7 items did not fit and it was slightly traumatic.

And this was such an obvious eventuality. I chose to gain weight while healing and I did. I’m much physically healthier. My digestion is much healthier, my skin has color back to it, I have energy, but in the back of my mind, I still feel like I did something wrong and it’s very hard to let go of that feeling. :(",1535383829,8/27/2018 10:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/9apwu1/cant_fight_the_thought_that_i_did_something_wrong/,0

145,9ad4pr,recovering anorexic/bulimic,"so i’ve never really been able to talk about this much but i was suffering from originally bulimia that developed into ana.
it lasted for around 2 years in which i ended up losing 50ish lbs.... went from 150-160 to 113
a combination of antidepressants and jut general displeasure led to me not eating anymore and when i would eat id throw it up,,
eventually got to the point where’d i strictly only drink 1 smoothie a day
idk then around july last year something switched in me to where i suddenly started overeating 
i still felt just as bad about eating food, and still counting calories
i just felt terrible and couldn’t stop
originally would puke up all the food i ate but around september i started wearing makeup 
and wouldn’t want to ruin my makeup w tears/snot/vomit 
eventually eating still sucked and hurt but less
i gained a lot of weight back
multiple times have i tried to start purging again
or just stop eating in general. sometimes it would last for weeks
but always something just brought me back to eating more like eating out w friends or just the general fact that i just love the taste of food
anyway it’s now
and i eat regularly (not necessarily healthy) but i’m back at 160
i’m determines to lose weight!! i saw pictures of me at 115 and it’s so crazy that i ever thought i was fat at that weight, i wish i had that flat of a stomach now!!
anyway i really wanna try a healthy, lower carb (im addicted to starbucks, hell i work there) diet and start exercising!! 
i really don’t wanna go back to purging and (i forget the term for eating less??) 
because that time in my life was hell. just obsessed w food constantly, always on my mind, constantly dizzy and unstable and tired and exhausted 
probably the worst time for my cutting too. 
i don’t think i’m “recovered” because i definitely fall into old habits every now and then, and food definitely still has a negative connotation 
and the fact that i think i’m HUGE and fat rn is very stressful.
anyway. it’s progress at least :)",1535258679,8/25/2018 23:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/9ad4pr/recovering_anorexicbulimic/,0

150,9de9ts,My anorexia is still haunting me,"I got sick in 2015 with a bad stomach ulcer but didn't know what was wrong with me and gained 25 lbs - sometimes when you get an ulcer the pain mimics hunger and I was ravenous and couldnt stop eating.  Before that my body was ""perfect"" and I actually did like it, I was fairly thin with big boobs but all the sudden nothing fit. All the taunts from my sisters over the years of SOMEDAY YOURE GONNA BE FAT came back to haunt me in a big way. I became terrified of eating, I couldt even trust my own body to tell me when I was hungry. Food became the enemy. I started a serious diet and ate the base minimum calories to exist. I cried all the time thinking I was never going to eat anything I liked again. I started working out religiously, I poured over details of online weight loss tips. I dedicated myself to it one hundred percent - then I found out that my problems were being caused by said ulcer. I started taking meds and continued my psychotic workout regiment. After only a few shorts months, the ulcer went away and my normal digestion returned with a vengeance soon after. I dropped weight rapidly and all the sudden I was nearing 100lbs. My ribs jutted out. I lost two cup sizes practically overnight and when my bras stopped fitting - I realized I needed to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, three years later, I still have not been able to gain back the weight. I continue to have a messed up relationship with food and my anxiety and self loathing doesn't help at all. I used to like the way I looked, I liked my boobs a lot and now theyre gone and Im so sad all the time. My ribs are still showing in between my breasts and when I wore a low cut dress on vacation with my family my mom said I looked like a Holocaust victim. I hate the way that I look now, I cant believe I ever thought that this was the goal. That being sick looked attractive. Now I stare at other girls on the street with boobs and I hate, hate, hate myself for what I did to, myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Im new to this and have never spoken in detail of it online, or anywhere. I want to ask if theres any hope for my body to go back to the way it was before. I really miss my breasts so much and Im tired of seeing my ribs and having people think that Im sick still, even though arguably, I am. I dont workout anymore because it terrifies me. I know this is bad and that I really should get back into it but I dont want to lose any more weight and I just want someone to help me get back on track.

&amp;#x200B;

This is shocking to me because only 4 months prior I was 185 lbs and all I did was cry and eat. Then all the sudden I was 5ft 10in and 115 lbs at my lowest. But now im back in hell. My family found out and became so angry I was scared. I tried to gain weight in a healthy way as fast as possible because they would make  me step on a scale or I would need to go to therapy. This triggered an uncontrollable binge eating disorder. Im eating thousands of calories every day for the past 40 days and I feel sick and unhappy everyday. I can't fit into any of my clothing. I work in a kitchen and the culture is that everyone is constantly eating and I always had binge there. I need to restrict like I did before. I felt sexy on an empty stomach and I had everything I wanted. I had collar bones and shoulder blades and a thigh gap and a flat stomach. I need that confidence again or im not going to make it the end of the year.

161,9bn6mc,I think my friend pretends to have an ED,"I know this sounds rude, but I have this """"friend"""" who says she has anorexia, but I think she just pretends she has it because she is an attention-seeker. I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I wanted to know if her behaviour is actually related to an eating disorder or if she's faking it.

I'll try to keep it short, but basically she does things like saying ""I don't wanna have lunch today, I feel fat"". She spends HOURS tormenting people with that and when lunch time arrives, she eats as much as any other person, and brags about how healthy her food is compared to others and how our food is bs because ""that has meat and meat has a lot of calories, you know?"" and that sort of things. All she expects is for others to tell her she is not fat and praise her ""super healthy diet"". 
Speaking of which, her diet is not as healthy as she pretends it to be. Like, she will order a salad in a restaurant because ""everything else has cheese or meat. Ew, calories. How can you guys put all that fat in your body?"" and then have a cola for a drink instead of, I don't know, water. Seems contradictory to me, idk. (She DOES eat meat regularly, btw. She just enjoys shaming others for eating it).
Or buy a big popcorn box when at the cinema instead of having normal dinner, because apparently overly salty popcorn are healthier than a restaurant meal.
Also, this is, in my opinion, just very cruel from her part, but she has gone as far as to say (in front of her!!) that her eating issues are worse than those of a friend of ours who has been diagnosed with celiac disease, lactose intolerance and an unknown bowel disease (""because you know that you CAN'T eat [this food]. I can, but then I'll feel bad, so you have it easier"").

I've known her for 5 years now, and I have spent up to 12h a day with her during months (we were classmates at uni, and now coworkers) and I've never seen her skip any meal or go to the bathroom to puke. She also hasn't experienced any noticeable weight gain or loss in these 5 years I've known her. Btw, she has an average weight. 

I wanted to know the opinion of people who have experienced ED (or have any experience with people with EDs) to be more sure about whether she might really have eating issues (which she deals with by shaming others) or if she's just a b**** faking it for attention and using it as an excuse to shame others.

163,9eztob,Why can’t you just eat?,"Why don’t you just eat?
I am sure this question has crossed everyone who has ever encountered someone with anorexia’s mind. Such a simple question and although I can attempt to try and answer this for you in a way you will understand I am probably still not going to be able to. Ultimately those with anorexia have brains which are working a bit differently than those who don’t and despite some similarities we are all individuals as well so every single person’s experience is going to be a bit different. It is so impossible to explain something to someone else who has not encountered it first hand. Even if you try and describe it with things they might have experienced then that is still going to be clouded by the fact that everyone’s experience of the same thing is different. Anyway I think one of the main reasons is fear. Now I am not talking about the kind of fear you feel when you are about to give a public speech or ride a roller coaster but I am guess I am basically asking you ‘why don’t you go jump off that 200m cliff into shark infested waters?’ To be honest though there have been many times where that would have been a less frightening option that putting extra food in my mouth. Also the cliff just requires one act of bravery and in this case is probably going to result in death so still a better option than eating as this is not a one off. Eating has to be done continuously and there is no escape at the end. You don’t get to die but instead the fear is even more amplified as the actual act of eating was only the first part. The sharks are now chewing away at all of your limbs and there is no pain relief. There is no one there to hold your hand either. You can literally feel the fat being deposited on every part of your body and to most people you are probably thinking ‘ so what ?!’  but to someone with anorexia this is a lot more frightening than death. This is why anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. It is not just death by starvation but suicide is a big contributor to this statistic. I have no words to describe the never ending torment someone with an eating disorder endures. It is real and it is absolute torture. 
Another point I need to bring up in answer to this question is that we do actually eat. Some of us may even eat just as much as you. The anxiety of eating can result in us ridding of the calories we have ingested in any way we can. Whether it is excessive exercise or making yourself sick. Neither of which are actually very effective either to be honest adding to further anxiety when we eat. We all know how much exercise one has to do to burn off anything really and there is only so many hours in a day. 
And the most important answer to this question is that eating does not actually solve the problem anyway. Even if our weight is restored does this mean we are cured? Absolutely not. In fact we are probably going to be worse mentally as anorexia is often a coping mechanism for other issues and illnesses. The support required to help someone who has gained weight is so intensive and inadequate the whole weight gain thing can end up just being a vicious cycle. One gets help to gain weight and then as soon as this happens is left in an incredibly vulnerable state with minimal support. Eating does not solve the intense disgust and worthlessness we feel in ourselves. You feel helpless, alone, inadequate and unloved. Ironically anorexia offers either a chance to be accepted or a way to fade away.  ",1536688628,9/11/2018 12:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/9eztob/why_cant_you_just_eat/,2

170,9gzdg3,Am I anorexic?,"A few months ago I was admitted to hospital after have starving and dehydrating myself. my weight has consistently been dropping over the last year and a half. I was by no means large, but all my fat seems to go to my belly. I can't help but notice it, and every time I see it I want to slim down, but it never seems to work. No matter what I do my belly fat just doesn't go away even my weight is much lower than it used to be. I don't understand how it's happening because I have the same bmi as other girls, but they seem way skinnier than I do. 

I've been in therapy for a awhile, but my counselors never seem to worry about my weight. I don't if I'm anorexic, but my friends have been worrying about me. I don't exercise at all, but I read about anorexia and it said that anorexic people excessively exercise. Does anorexia need a professional diagnosis, or can it be self diagnosed? 

I'm I just overreacting? The last meal I had was about four or five days ago. Each day since I've had very small snacks once or twice a day. I don't have any appetite, in fact the idea of eating makes me feel sick. I just eat because I live with my friend and he often makes me eat, even just a little.

I just need a piece of mind. I'm not sure on whether to bring it up to my doctors or counselor because it doesn't seem to concern them at all.",1537308977,9/18/2018 17:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/9gzdg3/am_i_anorexic/,10

I am currently at my lowest weight(45kg/99pnds) and i really look sick/malnourished...

And today when i was with my boyfriend on a coffee we were talking and all of sudden he asked me if i have bulimia or anorexia. I was so scared and i immidiatly said no and i said i dont want to talk about that stuff. I changed the topic and we continued talking about other stuff.

Now,he asked me to visit him for dinner and he described the ingredients and the weight of how much stuff he is going to put in one plate... i feel really scared because i feel like he realized that i am sick, and i need some help now. How do i tell him that i am anorexic?

I feel like that when i say it that i will hurt him and he will want for me to recover but i dont want to recover.
I know i should tell him, we trust each other and we tell everything to each other. This is a big thing and i dont want to hide it from him.

So the thing im asking for now is - how to start a conversation about it? :/

I'd faint for less than a second and wake up before I hit the ground. I was also a home schooled agoraphobe at this point in time, so it never became a big deal. I'm not sure how my family never noticed, but I was 5'7 and 93 pounds at my lowest point. Nobody ever noticed. My life goal was to get skinny enough that I'd look good once I killed myself. Nobody ever noticed. Eventually I realized the anorexia was killing me and that I didn't want to die. I dragged myself out of it. I don't know how but I managed to force myself back to eating. It's been years and I still find myself slipping back into these tendencies every so often. I told a few internet friends, but never anyone in real life. 

It bothers me that they never noticed. It bothers me that they talk about how good I looked before I got to looking sickly. I haven't even told my therapist. ",1536894205,9/13/2018 22:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/9foinn/nobody_in_my_real_life_knew_i_was_anorexic/,3

182,9j66lb,My eating disorder story and recovery:),"All my life I was always compared to my sister. In this story ill refer to my sister as C. (My sister being 3 years older than me) she wasnt perfect, not at all. She was rather messy and immature. Her room was messy, her car was messy, she wasnt ever good with money and spent it on unnecessary things. I was always the good child, never got caught, never got in trouble, kept my room tidy, never spent loads of money. It got to a point where my parents would rely on me. If my room was ever messy or I slipped up once, theyd always say ""you're starting to look like C"". I never thought much of it but it started really bugging me. C always yelled at my parents and cried and picked fights with them. I always tried staying quiet and never getting into them. Whenever I would get upset they wouldnt let me. They wouldnt have it. Id always keep everything bottled up because I knew there wasnt any use trying. ""youre starting to sound like C, you're rooms looking like C's"" those words just repeated in my head and I always thought it was so horrible to be C. C was also a little overweight. I started to believe that I needed to be the complete opposite of C. So I started dieting. After dieting nothing realy was working so I started excersising and calorie counting and really seeing results. Everytime I felt unmotivated I told myself dont be like C. It sounds fucked up to be so motivated to not be like my sister that I starved myself. My sister is great my sister is so amazing. Even though she was messy and a slob how could I not want to be her. After my parents had found out it was a journey to recovery. Even now I had never told my parents why it was the way it was because they would be heartbroken. I tell myself dont be like C, dont be the complete opposite of C, be me. :)",1537993446,9/26/2018 15:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/9j66lb/my_eating_disorder_story_and_recovery/,3

201,9jw1hi,I need help. Any advice for me? I just want to better myself and I don’t know how to start,"So first things first, I have extreme self image issues. I used to be fat as a kid (like really fat not just chubby) and I ended up losing all that weight in 6th grade. And I started getting taller so I really skimmed down. Well In middle school, I thought I was happy because I’m now skinny. Thinking back on it, I had an extreme mental issue here. I remember weighing myself every day multiple times and writing down my weight. It’s like if I would gain 1 lb I would instantly set myself out to go exercise. And my meals would go soemthing like this: 
Morning: water- maybe an egg and a fruit. 
Afternoon: a half sandwich with NO mayo + 3-4 crackers 
Dinner: whatever my mom made but just cut my portion down to half a plate. 

And as time went by it would be like only crackers and cheese or I would just restrict myself so much. And then it got to the point where i would eat a full meal and then find a time to throw it up and then go excicise to go get “rid” of whatever wasn’t able to come up. I have pictures of myself in middle school and I’m horrified. 

In highschool, I wouldn’t limit myself as much. I actually improved significantly. I only cut some sweets and fast food from my diet. That was about it. But I exercised a lot. And I would sometimes throw up whenever I felt that I ate too much. (Once a week or so) and stopped throwing up my senior year but I still had self image issues and feel like I’m just fat when I eat too much. It’s a feeling I get.  
But I know I’m not, just feels like it. 

I’m in college now and everytime I look myself in the mirror I see someone who needs to freakin eat! But then when it comes to eating, I don’t have an appetite. I just don’t. And when I do eat, I can’t eat that much cause I get bloated so fast and I start to get that fat feeling again. And my eating habits are so bad cause there’s times when I’ll eat once a day and other times where I’ll eat all day long. 

I want to gain weight. I want to look more “full”. I don’t like my collarbones popping out. I don’t like my skinny legs. My stomach... it’s a bit pouchy but idc I just want to gain some weight. I want muscle. But that requires me to eat a lot. And I’m afraid to eat a lot. Where should I start? What should I eat?

But I've found myself restricting again, and I thought it was just intuitive eating telling myself I wasn't that hungry or bothered but I think ana has got a hold again as today I've only had around 600 calories and when I think back I haven't hit over 1500, when I was happily eating 2000-3000 Cals a day my normal baseline! 
I've found myself being picky over food again, but I just don't feel hungry, atm I look at food and it just repells me. 
I have been stressed lately but I was ill with a head cold a few weeks back and put it down to that.
Is anorexia taking over or should I listen to my body and eat to what its telling me I'm hungry for? 
I'm scared 😭 I can't do that again. 
But the thought of eating anything right now is making me feel nausous and uncomfortable , and I can afford to loose a bit of weight I'm not unhealthy right now so maybe it's just my body saying slow down you don't need to eat as much right now and that's okay, next week I'll go back to normal?

226,9r0fjy,Ana came back for a visit,"I’ve been struggling with ED since middle school. ( I am 25 now) it seemed a lot easier back then... kids would tease me and I’d just go days without eating and hide my body underneath baggy clothes/sweatshirts. Once I got into high school I was eating again, I felt good about myself and confident - I gained weight but not much and was still comfortable being that size. 


College I ended up gaining A LOT more than the typical freshman fifteen (if you know what I’m talking about.) I was dating this guy and we ended up partying every night of the week which added up the calories from all the alcohol and late night munchies. Once I came back home I was at my highest weight ever - I felt so trapped in my body. 

I’ve always been very skinny and I felt like a completely different person like I was in a fat suit. I went back and forth between Anorexia and Bulimia for a few months and dropped a significant amount of weight. 

Trigger: for those who are curious I lost around 40 lbs. 
I felt good though, i was getting attention from guys again - people were talking to me because they thought I was pretty and thin. I felt like I had complete control - though I really didn’t.


Fast forward to now - I am currently in a new relationship with a guy and I have regained a lot of the weight I had lost. I feel utterly and completely disgusting with myself. I don’t like looking at my body in the mirror let alone feel uncomfortable getting sexual with my boyfriend because I don’t like the way my body looks. 

I’m currently fasting right now until I lose a significant amount of weight. I’ve been tracking everything I put into my body. ( which Is mostly just coffee, diet soda and water) I feel more determined this time around to do this and I guess maybe that scares me even more. I just want to feel like the person I was before... I feel disgusting and not myself because I am constantly stuck inside this fat body.


I’m ranting right now, I know.

229,9qfp9j,How can I help my friend?,"I have a close friend who I think has developed anorexia due to stress. She has always battled anxiety/depression, but this year has been especially hard on her.

What started as losing weight to improve her morale post breakup has spiralled into her losing 60lbs in about 8 months. She looks very frail, worn, with her ribs showing clearly. All her muscle in her chest is wasted away. She looks very unwell.

While she’s never used the word “anorexia”, she’s commented multiple times about her severe body dysmorphia.

She’s very defensive, the few times I’ve commented on her weight loss (after she brought it up to me first) I’ve been met with her shutting the conversation down by saying she’s tired of hearing criticism about it. I think her mother is on her case a lot about it. Even last night she texted me saying she lost another 3 pounds. I knew that if I commented on it, it would result in her not talking to me for a couple weeks.

She’s not the attention seeking type, (“oh I’m so ugly and fat...” in an attempt to have you butter her up). She keeps mentioning the weight loss to me, and it feels like she’s asking for help. 

But I don’t know what kind of help she’s looking for. I’m not allowed to talk about it, I’ve offered to pay for psychological help, I’ve done everything I can. It’s like she pushes me into a minefield where one wrong step results in her being angry and me wondering if I just pushed her into being suicidal.

I also live about an hour away from her due to work, which complicates things.

Does anyone have an idea for a way to provide meaningful, constructive help to my friend, in a way that won’t put her back up and closed to me? I’m trying not to be pushy, but she’s also scaring me.",1540227508,10/22/2018 11:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/9qfp9j/how_can_i_help_my_friend/,5

232,9qbbz9,I Don't Know What To Think,"Okay... It all started back in July. I got a new haircut and wanted to make my whole body look great for my eighth grade year. I suddenly wanted to eat better and exercise more so I could get a flat stomach. I had been obsessed with the fact my stomach isn't flat since I was in third grade, no lie. I also hated the fat on my thighs. I didn't like the way the fat spread out when I'd sit in school. I'd just stare at it and feel ashamed. 
         Something happens the night I get that haircut: I am possessed to do 500 ab crunches. And I do it. I start going on morning and evening walks with a family member. I'm eating better and not snacking as much, and still exercising throughout the day. Now it's August, and I'm eating less. I'm astounded by the fact I'm not that hungry anymore. I've lost no weight. I continue that pattern all month. 
        Now September, I'm eating even less. But when I'm in school, I forget about wanting to lose weight and have a flat stomach. I eat everything. But then I feel regret. Sometimes after meals at home I'll feel so bad after eating them. Then I start putting less on my tray and chewing my food until it's liquid in my mouth in small pieces. And I'm cold, so cold. I missed my period and my head always hurts. And I'm always so tired.

Now it's October. I'm eating even less. I don't eat much at lunch. I got my period but it was spotty and less than two days. I've lost no weight. I get super defensive about my eating habits. But some days I just eat a ton. And I feel so much regret. I feel like I ruined a lot of progress. Now I eat most everything with a fork because I think you can absorb calories through your skin. I do 10 minutes straight of jumping jacks multiple times a week. I go weeks without any major bowel movements. I ate a lot today and feel like I ruined everything. I got a calorie counting app and set my limit to 831. I'm 5' 1"" and 120 pounds. My BMI is perfect. But it's not what I want. I'm supposed to eat 2,400 calories a day, or close to that. When I would go over my limit I'd hate myself. I deleted the app, hoping I'd get better. No. I'm worse. I just don't know. I'm always checking my collarbones and stomach. Whether I'm in class or on the phone, I do that. Whenever I walk past a reflective surface I check my body. I don't know... My grandma knows I want to lose weight. I only talk about anything related to that at her house because my mum will get so mad if I ever brought it up. So I feel bad about that too.

236,9sxw2d,Fear of disappointing myself and those around me by being hospitalised,"I have been juggling between trying to get better, work, family problems and anxiety for two months now. My anorexia started about 1 year and a half ago and I got down to a very low BMI (13:5). I want to want to get better but I don't know why, I can't. I am being medically followed but it does not seem to be enough. I was determined to get better on my own (with some medical advice on the side) and that is what I told the people close to me who were very supportive about it. However, I am realising that I can't. Other than anorexia, my anxiety level is as high as ever, I can't concentrate at work anymore... The doctors advise me to go for a full hospitalisation for a few months. Accoriding to them, not being able to want to get better is symptomatic of the illness and, considering my low BMI my brain is unable to function properly and move away from the mecanisms of thought I have created for myself. Other recovering anorexics tell me it's the only way to go, and my friends encourage me to follow this advice telling me it's normal to get help and it doesn't mean that I am not strong, it only means I am moving forward. 

The problem is : other than disappointing myself, both my dad and my boyfriend (not on purpose) make me feel like I am giving up and I could still try to fight. I can't help but think like them whilst knowing fighting is becoming too hard. I am so scared of disappointing them or choosing to be hospitalised just because I can't be bothered to make the efforts of healing on my own.

240,9s0hoh,Does anyone have experience in treatment for an eating disorder in the UK (NHS)?,"**TW - height &amp; weight mentioned**


This will be very long &amp; for that I apologise. I have a lot to get off my chest.



I have suffered with some form of eating disorder (undiagnosed) since I was a young teenager. I am now 32. I am married with a 3 year old daughter. I am severely underweight &amp; I believe either anorexic, bulimic or an odd combination of the two. I mainly restrict my food intake but on some days I find myself having manic food binges &amp; vomiting to rid myself of it. The vomiting is getting harder to achieve &amp; the binging is ramping up. I feel totally out of control.

I am currently 5'3 &amp; 36kgs or about 80lbs. I have maintained this weight (or between 79-83lbs) for about 3 years now. It came back full force after my pregnancy after many years of lying dormant. I managed to recover by myself at university but it seems hopeless now.

Unfortunately I also have Crohn's disease which I have used to my advantage to explain away weight loss &amp; refusing food to my husband &amp; other family. 

I am terrified now that my daughter is getting older she is going to realise what is going on &amp; will take after me. She also doesn't deserve my anger when she interrupts a binge or bangs on the bathroom door while I am ""busy"". 

I am constantly miserable, exhausted, stressed &amp; tense. My entire life seems to revolve around food, calories, my weight, my body shape...I feel horribly selfish, self involved, narcissistic &amp; a terrible mother. I am a stay at home parent &amp; haven't had more than 2 hours away from my daughter since she was born...&amp; that was for driving lessons or hospital appointments or the odd haircut. I feel totally burnt out. I'm never alone, I never have my own space. My guess is I have turned back to the eating disorder as a way to have something, anything, that is just mine.

I have recently begun a new treatment for my Crohn's as I have genuinely been very unwell for the last 3 years in combination with the eating problems. Of course, this means I am being closely monitored which includes weight. If I don't gain I worry the doctors won't believe me when I say it seems to be working...so far.

I just feel like I'm losing my mind but every time I have gone to see my GP to speak about it I have bottled out &amp; just asked for a repeat prescription for my normal medications. I just don't know what to do. I can make the appointment but just can't say the words, can't ask for help. I worry I'm making a mountain out of a molehill.

On days like today I feel like I have a massive problem &amp; desperately need help. Other days, despite calorie restriction, I feel fine &amp; like I must be overreacting or being dramatic &amp; plenty of people eat 1000 calories a day for weight loss &amp; are perfectly healthy. I'm not even trying to lose weight now, just trying to maintain. However now due to my weight the calories my body needs to maintain my weight are so low it's pretty much what I was having for previously restrictive purposes anyway.

Has anyone been through anything similar? Does anyone know what treatment would be like, assuming I manage to actually request it? I assume there would be a long waiting list anyway &amp; I wouldn't even get any help for a year or more so is it even worth it? What if I manage to get better in a year? I have so many questions &amp; fears &amp; frustrations.

I apologise for the lengthy post...I really do appreciate if you read it, even if you can't help.

251,9tqe8o,How do I reteach myself that food is good?,"It’s been about 3 years since I’ve lost interest in eating. I’m not sure what it is, but I don’t ever get hungry or crave food. I force myself to eat when I start feeling flight headed and dehydrated. 

When I do force myself to eat, it’s extremely tedious, I literally have to force myself to chew and swallow. I can taste food, but nothing ever “tastes good.” I just taste it, but there’s no pleasure connected to the taste, no matter what food it is.

I know this isn’t normal, and doctors don’t think this is a real issue since I am a 5’7 male at 145 pounds. 

I exercise regularly, but recently stopped because I don’t want to lose any more weight. I’ve tried smoking weed and it didn’t help one single bit.

Please don’t suggest just “eating more” or eating caloric dense foods. The issue is that I don’t have hunger signals and food tastes like something foreign like a piece of wood or rubber might. I’ve posted so much about this online and searched on google and then answer is just “eat more caloric dense foods.” Well that would be easy, but I doubt these people have tried to eat when they have no appetite and aren’t hungry. It goes against instinct.


I’m considering taking steroids or doing some other drug because I’m getting desperate and no one seems to care since I’m a healthy weight. At this point I might just starve myself to the emergency room well knowing that this is an easy feat. My stomach never growls and I never get uncomfortable from going a whole day without food (just fatigued).",1541210365,11/2/2018 20:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/9tqe8o/how_do_i_reteach_myself_that_food_is_good/,5

I have feelings for a girl who is ""suffering"" with anorexia (she thinks she is fine, although has  been admitted to hospital on more than one occasion for blacking out and falling).

we're at a very early stage in the relationship, meeting for dates and kissing occasionally. We have a really good connection and our personalities match really well.

I'm thinking of making things exclusive and getting more serious.
She is a strict vegan, but her body is weak and she can only do so much exercise at a time, but is aware of this and is working on improving herself.

I think that having the support from a loving boyfriend and maybe living together will make a  difference and I'm willing to try and help with out mentioning or pushing anything on her.

She is a lovely girl and I'm very much looking forward to getting to know one another. 

Can anybody give me any advice on what I'm likely to find in dating (and living with) a girl who has anorexia?
Has anybody ever dated somebody with anorexia and how did you find it? 

Looking for some help and advice from somebody who has anorexia personally to let me know of anything that I should he aware of before hand! 

Thank out for taking the time to help!

i’ve been dealing w an unhealthy relationship w food for years now

the first time i went to inpatient something triggered in to me idk what but i know i thought “i think i am fat. everyone around me here is thin. i want to be thin.” i never self harmed before that visit (((one reason i think inpatient is bad, i almost feed off of other toxicity? idk how to explain it) i was just suicidal and depressed.

after i started cutting and throwing up my food

then i stopped eating and throwing up the protein shakes i drank 

i lost 60lbs? idk i just know my lowest was 113 at 5’6/7

anyway. i started eating more regularly due to being on the depo (it makes you hungry) and being on better meds?

so i’ve gained A LOT of weight and i’m above what i was at my starting point of my ED
i still hate eating so much, i wanna die when i eat but now i’m binge eating and shit i just want to never eat again idk

but anyway. my whole point of this post is i feel terribly fat right now. i hate my body, i don’t wanna to have sex or have anyone ever see me naked. i’m ugly.

i have some photos of my self near my lowest (they were check points/inspo type thing) and it just makes me so fucking angry that i thought i was so fat and huge when i was 115 w a flat stomach and thin everything.

for one, i would DIE to be that thin again. two, i will NEVER BE HAPPY.

no matter what weight i am i will ALWAYS think i’m fat. ugly. disgusting. i will never think i’m good enough. food is never ok. i don’t deserve it.

i hate this. when this go away? when will i look at myself and not hate myself? 

when will i not instantly regret eating something.

when will it stop? 




side note: i remember in freshman year going to fast food places with my best friend, eating whatever we wanted because it tasted good and not ONCE worrying about my weight. it was just food. why can’t things be like that again. hhhhhhhh

277,9xixsp,Whats wrong with me?,"I hope it's ok to post this here, if not sorry everyone and mods please remove and accept my apologies. 

I really don't know where else to turn, except maybe my dr but I am just not ready for that yet.

Ive always struggled with my weight. Being on the chubby side a bit. My mom would make fun and call me out for it, despite not being the same way herself. 

When I was 16 I was raped by my older abusive boyfriend. My mom refused to help me and I never went to the police. I began to self harm to punish myself.

In my 20's I began counting calories and keeping a food diary, giving myself only 1000 calories a day allowance. I lost weight. Mostly everyone gave me positive feedback. And this just fuelled me, to hear things like ""you're so tiny"" and ""so skinny"" felt rewarding. 

Then I got married and had two babies. My weight shot up. Three years ago I almost bled to death from a peptic ulcer on my bathroom floor, while my husband and kids were out. If they hadn't come home when they did, I was told I would not have made it. This began a battle with anemia and low iron. I had monthly blood transfusions and iron infusions. I lost a massive amount of weight. 

Partially because I was sick, and didn't want to eat because it hurt my stomach so much. But it turned into me wanting to remain thin and underweight, at any cost. I calorie counted and exercised too much. 

I finally got to a point where my health improved but my eating barely did. I remained thin but not underweight per say.  

Then in Jan of this year, I was raped again. I have been harassed and stalked by the man who did it since. I went to the police the very night that it happened. I reported the physical abuse and the sexual. Due to me living in a different country, and not having the funds to return. The case was not called to court, but that's another long story.

Since then I have had social anxiety, to the point I sometimes don't want to leave my house. It feels like due the fact unless I go back to the country my attacker lives in, I have zero control over anything. My body. My life.

Thus began what I wonder isn't an eating disorder...my ""symptoms"" are as follows...(yes I know that only a professional can diagnose me, I am just looking for answers before I go that route, if I go that route). Symptoms:

1. Eating less than 500 calories a day, on purpose. Sometimes I eat more when others express concern but not often, I blame my lack of eating due to the fact my health is heading south again, because of new ulcers.

2. I have a lot of inner dread that when I do eat, I will gain weight from even one meal or snack. 

3. I hate eating in front of people, I feel like they are judging me. I'm not exactly why I feel like that. But when I do eat, I almost always wait till I am alone to do so. 

4. I'm 5'9, 105lbs with a 24 inch waist. Every bone that can stick out does. My collarbones, shoulders, my spine (even when not bending forward, my ribs are visible from front to back, my hip bones, the bones in my arms, my pubic bone, the bones in my butt lol and my tailbone. You can see my veins and tendons in my arms. 

5. When I look in the mirror, I can see that I am too thin. But yet my head is constantly telling me that I am fat. That I still have like 20lbs to lose. 

6. I am constantly tired, weak, dizzy and easily out of breath. When I stand up from sitting or standing, heck even kneeling..I am so dizzy I have to brace myself for fear of fainting and inability to move. My entire body shakes, and everything spins. 

I'm cold all the time, even when others are complaining it's too warm. 

My cognitive function is slightly impaired. I forget things so easily. I struggle to recall words at times when I am talking. 

7. I think about my weight and food constantly. It is taking over my life. I can barely take care of my kids, because I lack the energy to do so.

8. My emotions are a mess. I am typically a happy person, who is hard to anger. But lately it's not like that. I'm snappy and short in patience. 

9. I mostly try to hide my weight loss, with baggy tops and layers.

Sorry this was so long. Thank you for reading. Any opinions, good or bad are welcome.

289,a0kqqh,Eating affecting sleep and feeling confused,"So I have awful sleep patterns. Tried about everything for it. Always seems to come down to how my sleeping is affected by my eating. I've got no motivation to cook or look after myself. Motivation to do anything only seems to come when I starve myself. Not eating helps me feel in control. I have ADHD that isn't well medicated and I assume some of this is related to the adrenaline my body pumps out when I starve myself, and how that motivates me.

But I'm struggling.

I can't eat properly, so I can't sleep. So I sleep at weird times and then continue to eat at weird times. I want the motivation to fix it but the only thing thats working for motivation is starvation. My girlfriend asks ""Is it too much to ask that you try?"" I am fucking trying damn it. I do really well for a long period of time and there's no reward for it, but I go through a rough patch and get told I just need to try to eat. Or try to sleep. Or spend the day tripping out from sleep deprivation so I don't sleep in the day.

""I've not seen you try to wake up or sort your sleep pattern in weeks""
Nevermind she hasn't done her washing up for weeks or get herself out of the house. Nevermind that I drove her to surgery at early hours of the morning last week.

""You're always fucking resting""
No I'm not. I'm always awake at night. Just resting at odd times. It seems like she doesn't care that I'm not eating or sleeping properly, more that I'm not available at the times she wants me to do things for her.

She cuts, she smokes weed all day, she sits in front of the TV all day. But of course she has depression and anxiety so she can't help it... Then she gets annoyed that I'm not awake at the same time as her to sit and watch TV all day.

It wouldn't be fair to say ""Is it too much to ask that you try?""
Try to stopping cutting yourself. Try to get out of the house. Try to stop smoking so much.

""Oh but I need to because weed helps me feel better and stops pain, I can't go out I'm agoraphobic, I need to cut myself to stay in control.""

Every one of her coping mechanisms fulfills a function. But mine are all just a lack of effort.

""When I'm depressed and suicidal I don't do washing""
And I don't do eating. Try harder.

Wash the glass you sterilised your mouth with, its easier than going back to hospital.
""Killing myself is easier""
I agree, then I'd have no trouble sleeping. Don't pressure me or I'll kill myself right? Being unable to do something without feeling suicidal is grounds not to try... Apparently. Then why should I try?

Shall I just threaten to kill myself when told I'm not trying? That shows I am right? Never mind that it just makes you petrified of asking them to do anything. Should I be threatening suicide more? Works for her...

Yet when she doesn't eat for herself;
""I need food for my meds and you haven't got me any whilst I'm broke""
There is definitely food in the house, she didn't check.
""I was suicidal because no-one cared about feeding me""
She hasn't cooked for me when I'm stuggling.
I can't eat and I need to try harder. She can't eat and I need to try harder.

Nothing is ever good enough. Why would I bother feeding myself? This is what I'm living for. And I don't want to live any more. Nothing matters. If my 'lack of effort' makes me uncaring, then she must hate me.

Kill me. I'm done.

Recently lots of external factors have been stressing her out lots (family drama, school stress, etc), and she’s been very depressed and anxious all the time. She went to her school psych services and they turned her away because a paper test they gave her said she wasn’t anxious. I know, assholes. Anyway recently shes been mentioning how she hasn’t been eating much because she’s stressed, and it’s gotten to the point where now she feels sick after 1 small meal, and actively refuses to eat at times. She’s down to 300-500 calories per day which I gather is not good. She hasn’t been diagnosed with anything yet but the signs are pointing towards anorexia. She’s seeing a school psychologist tomorrow to discuss these issues, but I’m worried they’ll turn her away like assholes again and further her distrust of the schools psych services.  Those of you with experience on this sub, what is the best way to help her?

312,a2k1em,It’s taking over and I’m willing letting it happen.,"This conscious craziness started only a few months ago, about 4+ or so. I’ve lost about 30-35lbs by basically only eating 3-4 times a month. Fasting. I feel so great while I’m doing and I’ve become addicted to it. I don’t have any cravings and I honestly just don’t feel hungry. When I do I just drink some water or have a little bit of a protein bar and I’m good to go for another 6-8 days. It’s crazy, I know. But today I weighed myself; 40kg. At the beginning of the year I was around 50-55kg. It’s insane. The concerning part is what started happening lately. Last time I ate I couldn’t hold it in. I didn’t want to throw up, I really didn’t but about an hour after I ate I had extreme pain in my abdomen as well as bloating. I ignored it. Soon after I started feeling nauseated to the point where I was afraid to open my mouth because I knew it would all come out. I ran to the restroom, as I predicted, it all came out. It was violent vomiting. I was stuck there for about half an hour until it just all spilled out. I didn’t want to eat after that. The likelihood of it happening again was too high so I just went back into fasting. It’s happened 3 times now. I’m scared of eating and I just don’t want to either. Sometimes I feel like I’m close to the end. My heart will beat fast and I feel as I’m about to fall over, yet I don’t. Today marks another week without food. I want to change it around but at the same time I don’t. It’s complicated I guess.

317,a24a9c,Need help dealing with [16F] sister with anorexia.,"Hello this is my first time posting here so I apologise if you see a lot of questions like this.

So over the past 10 months my younger sister recently became heavily anorexic rapidly. Things that so bad that she was taken to a special young people's clinic where she boards there and part of the problem is is that her program requires her to make weekend visits back home which she hates. It's like she's become so institutionalized and used to their way of dealing with things and the very thought of going back home is so intimidating for her. The moment she steps foot in the house she refuses to eat and drink point blank and so she gets sent back home immediately.

I really want to help her by I just cannot understand this logic whatsoever. Tge problem is I just get so impatient with her way thinking and just how much do stress she's course this family unnecessarily. I don't wanna make it sound as if I'm being aggressive at all and I really don't want to be like that. It's just, why is it just so hard to eat something it's not that hard. I understand I'm posting in the community who face similar challenges. How can I be a supportive brother to her.

I guess part of the problem is that I'm not a very patient person if I'm honest and trying to be around her is such a challenge when I'm back home. I couldn't imagine what Christmas is going to be like now and I'm absolutely dreading it.

What advice would you give to someone in my position? I understand that it's easier said than done with this ""just eat something"" proposition but it really is the case where they've taken something so simple and trivial, made it so hard unnecessarily - I just don't get it.

Take it from a guy with no eating disorders whatsoever. I would rather go out with a girl who is fat, diabetic and has heart disease with a great sense of humour, than with the girl who's depressed and skinny.",1543681076,12/1/2018 10:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/a24a9c/need_help_dealing_with_16f_sister_with_anorexia/,15

327,a5a0jq,Staying in Ketosis after a long fast- How did you keep your weight?,"My research has shown that what triggers the weight gain after a fast is that people start eating the wrong foods  again - carbohydrates in particular. If you consume carbs, your body won't feel the need to break down your fat anymore.

So what I'm planning to do after my month long water fast is start consuming zero carb, full-fat foods.

I want to start with 6 days of almond milk (13 cals/100ml), then go over to soy milk (33 cals/100ml) and then try more solid foods like unsweetened soy yogurt (43 cals/100g).

Do you think this would work? I'm still worried about gaining weight, even though I try my best to reintroduce my food slowly.

Also, very important:

337,a4pqmk,What triggered your anorexia?,"I’m curious as to how those who currently have ana or are recovered from ana started out in the first place. Whether it be tragedy, depression, illness, weight gain, the need to be pretty, etc.  

I personally have been the same weight my whole life (125 at 5’9”) and I never cared too much about my body until I met my husband at the age of 20. My husband was severely underweight for his age and height (120 at 6’3”) and I became obsessed with how beautiful his slender and long body looked and how fat and stubby I seemed compared to him. I went into a depression about my body and gained 40 lbs and I would cry every night about it and refused to let him see me naked or anything like that because I felt so ashamed, even my family started making fun of me for gaining weight and none of my clothes fit me anymore. So that’s when I started restricting and exercising relentlessly. I lost 50 lbs in four months and now all my old clothes are too big for me and I’m almost as skinny as my husband (115 at 5’10”)and I’ve only just began to understand what exactly I’m doing to myself and that I am anorexic and need help to be healthy again.

I really want to hear your guys stories, whether you’re relapsed, in recovery, or fully recovered. 

Edit: this isn’t Pro at all. My psychologist told me the first step to combating any illness is to get to the root of why you’re sick before you can start getting better.

349,a3qldp,Relapsing,"Hello all, I realize nobody will really read this, but I just want to share my story. 

I think I've been anorexic since I was able to distinguish a fat girl from a skinny girl--basically, since I was 10 years old I had been trying to fast for hours, eat only vegetables *minimally* in a day, and made the mirror my enemy. 

I always saw myself like this: if I am not pretty in the face, or in the personality-- I can at least have a pretty body right?

So all my life since I was 10 I had been roughly underweight until I got to high school-- I was 14 when I started to gain a lot of weight. I went from around 100 lbs and an underweight BMI to 115 lbs and a normal weight BMI when I reached the end of my Freshman year. For a while, I embraced the thickness I had. I was roughly 5'2 at this point, and things seemed fine until the end of my Junior year when I had grown an ince (5'3) and had gained a lot more weight-- I was roughly 120 lbs by the end of Junior year. I had migraines all the time, I got sick very often, I would eat like a pig as soon as I got home and begged any one and everyone to eat out at some greasy restaurant. At this time I could barely squeeze into a size 7 and was on track to become a size 9. 

Then one day it, I remember sitting in my dark room--the sun nonexistent. I looked down at my stomach and all I saw was a disgusting flab of fat, sitting an another flab of fat. I literally told myself that day 'When I go back to school, everyone is going to see how skinny I got.' That summer is when things started getting really thin. 

I decided to try intermittent fasting and ate only *one* thing a day. Not one *meal,* but *one edible item a day.* It was very hard at first, but I managed to distract myself with school work. By the time school started, I weighed roughly 108 lbs and only went down from there with more distractions. By the middle of Senior year I weighed between 92-94 lbs. This is when people began to worry. My mom made me feel so terrible, saying I was only bones, what had happened to me--etc, etc. 

Well what had happened was I would try to starve myself so much so to the point where I could feel that hunger hit me, and to the point where I could virtually feel the fat gurgling itself away--  I never saw any results at first until I stepped on the scale and saw what I had done. 92 lbs from 119 lbs, 5'3 inches tall. It became an addiction, it's really made me happy to see I had lost all that weight. 

Then I graduated--by that time I was steadily packing the pounds back. Some things had happened in my life that made me go to food for comfort. Slowly I began to eat normally, first having a meal every day--then I started working and college began and I've hit my highest weight in months. I'm now roughly 107.5 lbs on a good day, and 110 lbs on a very bad one. I don't know how it got to this point again. I can't even breath in my size 3 jeans-- I can't wear anything without feeling disgustingly fat and I am trying to get back to 95 lbs at the very least. 

Today I drank coffee with 2 tbsp of Polyethylene Glycol, a laxative and pretended to eat my breakfast. Now I've been sipping more of the laxative with water and just need to keep on going today. I don't feel hungry like how I usually do around this time, but when I do I think I'm going to down apple cider vinegar (2 tbspns) whole and hope that works to curb any hunger-- at most I'll just eat a donut today and that's it. I'm hoping to eat nothing at all.",1544120332,12/6/2018 12:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/a3qldp/relapsing/,5

354,a7h9j5,I'm afraid I might develop Anorexia.,"Hey all.

Lately I have been obsessively checking nutrition facts, have started exercising every day, have tried eating less and etc.

It all started with me trying to just cut off unhealthy foods, which I did and I am proud of that but it has gotten worse. My BMI is completely normal, it's even kind of close to being underweight but it is not quite there. I know that being underweight is just as bad as being overweight.

But I haven't been able to stop feeling guilty after every single time I eat whether it's fruits and veggies, oatmeal, rice, meat, anything really. 

It makes me feel extremely depressed and I cannot stand seeing myself from the side in the mirror. I look so wide.

359,a6rgb9,Talking about control,"I want to share some mental exercises I do in regards to my perception of control. I know control is such an important issue for many of us here. I hope these ideas can be of use to someone. 

Sometimes when the voice of anorexia gets to be too loud, it’s easy to fall into the pattern of viewing it as a separate entity, one that’s controlling me. All this serves to do is to reinforce the illusion that I don’t have control, which as we all know makes the problem worse. Something that’s helped me to stay on track with recovery after almost two years after my hospitalization/therapy is to think of my anorexia as a tool of sorts. This tool for me takes the form of a double edged sword. It’s an ineffective tool that allows me to pretend to tackle my problems while at the same time hurting myself. But the amazing thing about holding a tool is that you have a choice to put it away and not use it. You can choose a different, perhaps less flashy but far more appropriate tool to solve the issue at hand. And the more I’ve chosen these more appropriate tools, the less I’ve felt the need to reach for the double edged sword. At times the thought of it even seems laughable in comparison to the love and compassion for myself I’ve slowly gained by choosing other things. Easier said than done, I know, but viewing an eating disorder in this light helps to give perspective about the control that I do have in those tough moments and give a clearer picture of what I may really need. It also helps to remove the shame that comes with choosing to use my ED, because instead of “failing,” I’ve now just “used a tool that wasn’t helpful.” So when I fall, which I do, I’m able to stand back up again instead of relapsing. 

The second thing that I want to share is a visualization that I do when I start to feel pulled in too many directions. Abusive people in my past, my job, my perception of other people’s judgment, and my social obligations are examples of things that I perceive as pulling on me or taking away my choice in things. Like anyone, I feel trapped if I’m under the impression that I don’t have choices or control, and the ensuing desperation can make falling back into anorexia more tempting than usual. To help mitigate my perception of control, I close my eyes and picture all the control I have as a flame inside of me. I then imagine that in order to lend someone else my control, I would have to light a candle with the flame and send it off to them, but that it’s still attached to me by a string. I look around in my visualization and see where my candles have floated. Perhaps one has floated to my significant other, who I’ve tried to make responsible for my emotional satisfaction. I gently pull that candle back and put the flame back inside of myself. (This prevents unnecessary resentment in your relationships, by the way). Perhaps I’ve let my abusive parent’s words from my childhood get to me. I pull the candle back from that parent. You do not need to be giving power to your abusers, whether they’re still in your life or not. I pull the candles back from my friends, my coworkers, the pretty model on a magazine, the stranger who gave me a weird look on the street, and anything that I feel is “pulling” me. I imagine that pulling the candles back doesn’t hurt the other person and the only thing that it affects is my perception of the control over myself and my actions that I inherently have - the kind of control that is a part of me and belongs to me. I do this visualization several times a day if I need to and at any time (at work, in the shower, on the metro, etc.). It really helps me, and even if it doesn’t work out for you, I’d encourage you to create your own unique ways of coping.

375,a9ozrn,I feel fat,"So after my 20 day fast I had to break it due to a vacation. 4 days of eating 1-3 meals. Went right back to fasting the day after and I’m currently a week in; is it weird that I feel so fat?! I look in the mirror and I feel like I look huge! I can still see my bones but ugh. My daily intake during those days didn’t surpass 1,000 calories though. I’m a healthy raw vegan when I do eat so I know it was all low calorie. Just the fact that I ate makes me feel like I’m a blubbery whale. Planning on going another week, I’d go longer but my BF is planning a trip that’ll mark an end to a 15 day fast. He will not let me go without eating when we’re together, he’s not fully aware of my lack of intake but he knows enough to not have me eat at least once.

382,a9hro7,I'm in forced treatment - a short rant,"Because I'm underage, my parents have been forcing me to be in family treatment for the past 5 months. Every Thursday we go to Mount Sinai hospital in Manhattan (an hour and half drive every week) to do an hour and a half of conferencing and weigh-ins with a therapy team. And because my weight essentially dictates how much my parents will force feed me for the rest of the week, I water load to gain at least 5 pounds of water weight in one sitting to fool them. Outside of treatment, my relationship with my parents has been growing more and more strained because I lash out whenever my mother gives me more than I can manage (I still count calories - going above 700 at this point makes me want to kill myself). Everyone feels like an enemy. Antidepressants and anxiety meds have not eased the pain of being in this situation and I honestly need someone to talk to - particularly someone who's dealing with a similar situation of forced recovery. I feel isolated from the chance to be happy because the only thing at this point that makes me happy is eating little to nothing.

435,aa73v1,Trying to Recovery with another anorexic in the house,"Hey there, I hope you all are doing well.

I’ve been steadily recovering from anorexia after  about a year or so of it’s mental torture. I’ve gained quite some weight (lowest point of the year was 90 and now I’m at my highest at 112) 

I think I would be doing great right now, I would be very happy. I am eating anything and everything I can get my hands on. I ate 3 piping hot bowls of white rice with sauce today, and loads of Hershey’s chocolate and even a Starbucks coffee. I am scared to check my weight but I know it’s not 108, 109– I’m guess I’m at about 110 or 112. (I’m somewhere between 5’2-5’3) 

I was going great for a while until my aunt who’s 27 started losing tons of weight. Now she’s my height and weighs around 112-113. I know this because she does what I used to do when I was deeply anorexic. There’s only one scale in the house and I see her sneak in and use it; today I caught her and asked what she was doing and she said “just checking my weight”

Now I feel like this is some sick joke. I am finally recovering and now my aunt is falling in the same thing as me. Now she’s my same weight. Now she watches what she eats, eats considerably less than I do and probably less than once a day. I feel terrible that now I might not be able to recover with another suffering and losing weight right in front of me.

I wish I was her size— she is thinner Than me although my weight is a bit less— her legs are skinny and mine are thick. I hate that she is thinner than me with a sick kind of envy and I don’t know why this is what I feel. Because she is doing what I wish I could do effortlessly — she is thin easily. And I am not. I don’t know what to do. ",1545972768,12/27/2018 22:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/aa73v1/trying_to_recovery_with_another_anorexic_in_the/,4

442,aedvpq,Harmful side effects of anorexia?,"This might be somewhat of a stupid question, seeing as I could just google it. But I prefer talking to people and I don’t gather information from static articles well. The upcoming post is kind of long so thank you for reading.

Long story short - I don’t know if I actually even have anorexia. People used to joke I had it in high school cuz I was always thin. But I have noticed when I get depressed (not officially diagnosed - but no better way to explain it) I don’t want to eat. I either don’t get hungry or I just don’t feel like eating anything to satisfy my hunger. I am not overly concerned about being fat, although if I eat too much at once I may worry about it. But that is not my reason for not eating (usually - I may skip a meal to retain my figure since I don’t work out but I just really want to drive home that this isn’t the main reason I don’t eat).

Anyways I have been pretty depressed this entire year (haha I know it’s only been 9 days but that’s how it’s been 😅) and I have been noticing a HUGE drop in my appetite. I am already underweight, although I gained some more during the holiday season (still underweight tho), and my usual (pre new year) diet consists of maybe a light breakfast item, usually bread based, a small personal pizza french bread thing for lunch with a Coca~Cola, and then nothing for dinner. Maybe some take out if I feel like driving out of my way. On the weekends I don’t even get out of bed so I usually go as long as I can without eating, then after I feel terrible I may order some food to be brought to me. 

However recently I’ve found myself not even wanting to eat that much. I have had a single (not a pack) pop tart for breakfast, skipped lunch entirely, and had nothing for dinner. I have had trouble sleeping and overall just haven’t been feeling “up to it” emotionally or physically. I am becoming more tired, apathetic, and getting little headaches/stomach pains more than usual. I usually experience these symptoms anyways but I eat my “normal” amount and I’m fine (I have been living this way for a long time). I also have noticed a huge jump in not being able to pay attention to something for a long time, just needing to randomly rest for no reason, and a lack of focus since the new year...

My boyfriend is always worried I’ll end up in the hospital for my eating habits and I genuinely think he is being overreactive. But ever since this new year I’m starting to wonder if I may actually end up hurting myself.

Can anyone give me some sort of advice? Are these side effects of not eating or something else? Is there something else I should be watching out for in case it does get serious? 

**TL;DR ever since the new year I went from eating a small breakfast and lunch a day to eating a single pop tart a day and I’m starting to worry myself. Help.**",1547083461,1/9/2019 19:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/aedvpq/harmful_side_effects_of_anorexia/,12
443,aec9f4,What would you like to hear?,"Hi! (A bit long post ahead)

I don't have Anorexia, but I am getting more and more concerned for a friend of mine. I know you shouldn't say so without knowing a lot about it, but she is showing all the signs of an eating disorder and has lost 15kg in 6-12 months. She struggles with anxiety, depression and struggles with hurtful thoughts about her brother who is overweight. As for herself, she is on the brink of being extremely underweight. Ahe is quite young and I live far away from her so I don't get to see her that often. But I want her to get better. So, the queston is: How should I support and help her? Is there anything I should avoid talking about? How should I react when she tells me things like she hasn't eaten for days? She recently asked me how many calories there is in a chewing gum. What to say? State the facts and let it be? Assure her it's safe? She has also told me she sometimes wants to eat, but she can't as she says. What can I say to this that may help her?

TL; DR 
I suspect a friend of mine has Anorexia Nervosa, how should I go forward in helping her? When she tells me she hasn't eaten anything for days, how should I react?

I grew up very poor with no food- my mom was a drunk and the only meal I got was school lunch once the teachers found out I had no bag lunch. Well I guess I just got used to eating no food. I’m 39 now and never hungry. I really want to gain weight but eating so much food is offputting. I really just don’t want to eat. Food doesn’t even taste good to me. I only eat just to live, i could eat the same thing every day and I wouldn’t even care. If they made a dog food for humans I would eat that. I don’t even bother seasoning my food, it makes no difference as I’m not eating it for enjoyment so it doesn’t matter to me. What can I do to start enjoying food? Is this a form of severe depression? I never thought I was anorexic, I don’t care about calories or my weight- I just don’t care about food. I forget to eat a lot. I’ve tried some things like anti depressants (lexapro, Prozac, Wellbutrin) hoping they would increase my appetite but it did the opposite and I had to stop when I lost too much weight.

I was talking to a friend about someone we both though was a bit off and i mentioned how that said person told my parents they need to watch what i eat because i’m fat etc etc

and my friend was appalled, she mentioned how she thinks i’m thin and she’s happy that i’m eating and actually have some weight and how she was worried about my weight previously. 

and that kinda had me shook, considering i’ve never mentioned my ED to her before. I thought no one had any idea. but as i’ve found out these past years, many people did know and were just silently worrying.

489,ag06h6,Managing in College,"Hello. I’m an 18 year old female college freshmen hours away from my hometown. I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa at 10 years old, and have been struggling on and off for a few years. My most recent relapse was during the summer after senior year of high school. My parents are very much so on my back about weight, to the point where I dread going home and being weighed. They are strict even when I do gain weight. In addition, I deal with disparaging comments from my mother about my weight and how I look. I am working to maintain/gain weight in college, but running into some road bumps. I have a great meal plan on campus, but it is very difficult to be spontaneous about eating with friends, and I find a lack of motivation to get up and walk to a dining hall or restaurant on campus. I was wondering if anyone who is/has been in college, especially out of state, could give suggestions on how to beat manage the disease in this setting. Thank you so much.

506,af97a4,Battling Strictly Behavioral Starvation?,"Hi there, I wanted to keep this short, but I tend to ramble, so sorry about that. I mention food and the amount of time I haven't eaten but no calories/weight, I'll add the TW tag for now. Mods let me know if it's needed?

So I have been battling anorexia for well over a decade, I went through a long battle with addiction that I used as a ""bandaid"" to combat my eating disorder. I recently got out of treatment for addiction and I'm sober for probably the first time in a decade. Great right? No. All my eating disorder behaviors came back *hard* thing is I don't still have the body dysmorphia, I don't look in the mirror and feel fat or anything, I think I look like shit and too thin. Yet, I can't stop starving myself. It's been 10 days since I've eaten, in the past 12 I may have had 2 bowls of cereal and 2 vitamin waters? I want to be able to eat but I can't bring myself to consume anything but water and a single black coffee.


I seriously feel like I'm going to drop dead because my body is rejecting anything I put in it when I have tried to eat, now I'm just throwing up water. I'm afraid my electrolytes are out of whack, but I can't bring myself to drink a Pedialyte. I tried CBD oil for the first time 2 or 3 days ago and made it through daytime without getting sick, but still couldn't eat. My behavior is so fucked up that I can't try a single 1 of the CBD gummies I bought because I can't bring myself to open my mouth and consume something even that tiny.

It's entirely behavioral and I don't know what to do. When I have been in ED treatment a lot of it focused on the body dysmorphia, but not so much on the strictly behavioral. If anyone has tips or links to resources for the behavioral bit, I'd really appreciate that. I'm not ready to die, especially not like this.

Thank you.

ETA: I'll spare you the numbers in this post, but I'll say part of the reason I'm so scared is because of how low my weight has dropped. I'm in dangerous territory.",1547312328,1/12/2019 10:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/af97a4/battling_strictly_behavioral_starvation/,1

The first time I’ve realized this was like in October 2018. She also exercises very excessively. She probably workouts 3 hours a day almost every day of the week. And those workouts are intense. And I noticed that a lot of her health projects were Anorexia and that she would always do thorough research on it. (I just feel like she was tying to find information for herself in a way but I could be wrong) She sometimes said to me that she is Anorexic when one of her other friends asked her about it.

I was smaller back then. 140 or so, I wanted to be 100 but I learned later it was nearly unachievable for me. I was kicked out of my parent’s house at 18, and eventually focused so much on eating and trying to not go to sleep hungry. I was in a horrible place, constant fast food, but I wasn’t struggling with anorexia anymore. I weighed in recently, I was over 200. I had gained 60 lbs and hated myself for it. I decided I’d try to healthily lose weight, go to the gym again, and count calories again. It’s turning into an obsession again and I don’t know how to stop. I’ve cut out carbs and I’m always on the treadmill trying to burn off what I’ve eaten, in the name of “health.” My boyfriend keeps telling me to just eat healthier and not be so obsessed, but it’s tough.

524,aj3eh4,Stress has me restricting again,"Background
I was anorexic as a child and into high school. It wasnt until I hit 20 that I decided to take control of my life and not just my meals and I recovered and actually got overweight. Legitimately overweight like maybe I should diet type overweight. I was finally happy with my whole life and saw my expanding waistline as proof that everything was finally good. Then I got engaged to an amazing man, literally he is wonderful. Still all good until last May when I picked up my wedding dress and saw the photos of me in it. Cue extreme anxiety and self consciousness at my 220+ lbs. The next month we bought a house and started rehabbing it, plus DIYing all the stuff for my upcoming wedding the next spring. I began IF and then cutting out sugars, then cutting out carbs. All in the name of being a healthy skinny bride and not this whale in a white dress. 
Fast forward to now. I've lost ALOT of weight and I've been strict about my diet and such. Protein smoothie for breakfast, coffee for lunch with splash of cream no sugar, dinner is generally a protein and veggie option under 5 carbs. I thought I was doing good until I plugged what I've been eating into my food app which was super helpful when I started but I stopped using after I got the hang of the meal prepping. 
I'm only eating 500cal a day IF I drink a smoothie for breakfast, if not I'm only consuming about 300cal. I didn't even realize how quickly my ED came back and took hold. I love how I feel, I love how I look, I love everything except knowing that I'm full swing back into that slippery slope into hospitalization again. I spent 10 years doing good, well overeating for sure but I wasnt starving myself.

526,aiz2dv,ED’s ruin everything &amp; I’m tired of it,"I ate a mini pizza yesterday and I felt so disgusted with myself. Each bite I took was making me internally freak out, but I kept going in for a bite and swallowing it. I then made some tea while running around my kitchen like a mad man. I ended up repeating the words “only tea” over and over again and then switched to counting each step I took. I then went back to my room to jog in place to punish myself for eating. I tend to be in a daze and stumble every now and then, but the guilt of eating something other than an apple drives me crazy. I, for the most part, quit purging because my teeth are getting effe’d up, BUT if I’m feeling nauseated I won’t hesitate to get it out. I just feel like a disgusting piece of shit and I don’t understand how my boyfriend still loves a fat shit like me. ED’s are silent and slow motherfuckers waiting to kill, but I’m not ready to die yet. To all of you guys still here, I’m proud of you and I’m rooting for you.

527,aixtvn,I relapsed and so did my friend.,"I've been restricting again for about a month and a half, and when I first started relapsing I told my friend who also has an eating disorder(and who was also semi-recovered). She completely ignored my message, never replied, never acknowledged it and never said anything to me in person or otherwise. I was a bit hurt because I was hoping for some sort of support or even a fucking acknowledgement of my suffering!

We were out to eat recently and she saw the MyFitnessPal app on my phone and said I should delete it. Just now, I found out she started running a ""pro-ana"" tumblr AND Instagram around the time I told her I relapsed. So basically, she ignored me and forced herself to relapse too, to ""compete"" with me I guess, without telling me.

I reported her accounts because I think ""pro-ana"" sites are totally fucking immoral, and I can't help but feel extremely angry and betrayed. ",1548233897,1/23/2019 2:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/aixtvn/i_relapsed_and_so_did_my_friend/,1

Day 1 up until the end of day 2 we’re great, before bed on day 2 I had a massive bowl movement (loose).
I woke up on day 3 feeling nauseated and bloated - I ate; meals and snacks.
The day ended badly, I went to bed feeling huge, bloated and like I needed to poop and throw up.
Today started off the same but about 2 hours after breakfast I had loose stool again and an hour later I started getting shakey and I felt actual hunger. I had a snack and I felt better. Had another loose stool followed by “the shakes” about 3 hours after my snack so I opted for lunch because I felt tingly. Low blood sugar?
After lunch I had another loose stool and about 4 hours after that “the shakes” returned and I asked for my lunch break. 
Felt so full after so I just decided to call it a day but I’m still getting slight nausea though.

Are all these symptoms normal? What’s happening to my body? 
Prior to starting recovery I hadn’t eaten anything 15 days before, this was my usual routine though.

536,ailn1d,Does anybody have stomach issues they think contributed to the development of their ED?,"I’m curious if anybody else here grew up with stomach issues, which they think contributed to their ED. My first memory is of binge eating, and I came to find that over the years, I was more predisposed to binge eating as my stomach would “randomly” get upset, causing me to eat whenever I could manage it. Just now - at the age of 26 - I am learning what my stomach issues may be and are finding a solution. 

As a teen/young adult, I knew food would make my stomach volatile - and stress more so. Knowing such, I found it much easier to embrace disordered eating patterns as it was less likely to upset my tummy if I wasn’t eating or binge eating. I think this was a significant factor in my developing an ED, as when things got stressful I already had a poor relationship with food. 

Anybody else have this experience? 

((Disclaimer: of course I know EDs come from a plethora of places- genetic predisposition, mood/anxiety disorders like PTSD, environmental factors, etc.)) ",1548153583,1/22/2019 4:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ailn1d/does_anybody_have_stomach_issues_they_think/,5

538,aij9tz,Diary of My Mind ( possibly triggering so please be careful. I just need someone to listen to me cause things are pretty bad)," 

As a child, I loved nothing more than myself and I wanted everyone to know me-my best friend. I was always wearing sequin-covered dress up clothes, or whatever would catch the eyes of everyone around me. I was definitely a shy kid, but I didn’t care if anyone thought that I looked stupid, or weird. I was just happy to express myself and be alive. My self-image was thriving. Yet, recently I’ve keep finding myself wondering how I went from being that bold kid to being the girl who can’t recognize her own reflection.

I don’t really remember how things got to be like this. One day I was eating and laughing like a normal person, and then all of a sudden, I slipped off the rails and lost all control. 

Control.

That is the single word that taints my mind whenever I think about what my life has become. I keep stating that I’m doing these things to myself because it gives me a sense of control.  I am consciously making the decision to not eat and I’m following through with it. For once in my life, I’m accomplishing something. I am telling my body what it can and can’t do. That choice is mine to make.  However, in reality I know that I’m more helpless than I’ve ever been.

I honest to God cannot get myself to eat. The anxiety of what repercussions will occur afterwards fills my veins with blind terror. If I consume any food, my entire world will fall apart. All of the progress that I’ve made towards becoming thin will disappear. Food has easily become my greatest source of distress. There’s no joy in eating. It only makes me hate myself more. It’s a nightmare that I just want to be over as soon as is starts.

                I have been diagnosed with an eating disorder. I completely resent that. I personally don’t feel like it’s that bad most of the time. I eat 100-250 calories a day-vitamins included, burn off 330 from running and I still have enough energy to feel okay and be happy. I’ve adapted to it. However, there are the horrendous days where I loathe not only food, but my entire life. My entire body aches, the people around me drive me up the walls; I become a bitter version of myself who wants to either be skinny or be dead.

                So many parts of what make me wonderful have been sacrificed in order for me to achieve my sadistic goal. My body no longer produces a menstrual cycle. I shiver when I’m in an 85 degree room. Just yesterday I was brushing my hair like usual and a ginormous clump fell out. While it broke my heart, it also motivated me. It made me feel as though my illness was validated. Other things that have occurred include; extremely dry skin, chronic constipation, excessive headaches, mood swings, passing out from exhaustion, cramps, random bruises, heart palpitations, and a rectal prolapse. Yeah my rectum literally fell out of my body, but not even that was enough of a reason for me to stop. The only thing that can stop me at this point is death.

Multiple people have asked me what my ultimate goal weight is, and the truth is that I don’t have one. Originally, I just wanted to be 130 pounds. I was supposed to hit that weight and then just stop. However, when I did finally reach that I still saw myself in the exact same way that I did when all of this started. I couldn’t see a difference in my appearance. It was as though no weight loss had occurred. So I kept pushing myself. I’m still going and I intend to keep doing so until I see a difference. 

Looking at my reflection is exhausting and scary for me. Truthfully, I don’t know what I look like. I see a face in the mirror, but it doesn’t look like me. It’s as though a duplicate of me was made but it’s slightly different. Something is off, but I don’t know what. This is probably the most depressing part of everything that’s happening. It means that I didn’t just fuck up my relationships with everyone around me, but I also fucked up my relationship with myself. I’m living in a stranger’s body.  I miss who I used to be. I miss her so much.

It’s been so long since I’ve actually felt alive. Back when I was younger my soul was overflowing with hope. No matter how bad things got I knew that they’d always get better. Nowadays everything feels pointless. I definitely still get moments of hope where I feel like I can eat and live like a normal human again, but then at the end of the day I realize that I can’t even get myself to eat 400 calories and I’m stuck in this endless loop of agony. I really do want to get better, but if I do I want to remain skinny. There’s also a part of me that doesn’t feel like I deserve to recover. I’m not thin enough and things aren’t as bad as they could be. I have an average BMI so how on earth could I have anorexia? I’m not sick enough. These are the thoughts that always cause me to sink further into my disorder. They make me relish in being ill. Trust me; I know that’s absolutely sickening. Yet, I can’t really bring myself to care.

I don’t really know where I’m supposed to go from here. The best thing that I can do right now is remind everyone else of how beautiful they are. I’m going to make sure that both my loved ones and enemies are taking care of themselves and eating. My greatest fear is that someday my niece could fall into this behavior pattern.  So I’m going to try my hardest to help her see the radiant young woman that she is. I hate my eating disorder with every fiber of my being, but I’m too scared to let it go. I guess I’m just going to have to learn to cope yet again.

It’s so crazy to hear this because whenever I look at myself in the mirror, I see something completely different. I feel I look the same I always looked, with the same problem areas to tackle. 

I want to get better but then there’s that voice in the back of my mind that tells me everyone else isn’t seeing me clearly or that they all have different ideas of the ideal body etc. 

It’s so hard for me to believe I look so sick, when I feel I look the same.

It’s difficult to accept the supposed severity of my situation. 

No matter how much weight I lose, I never see the difference. 

I’ve stopped weighing myself because I have a hard time even believing the scale.

Is it possible that all this isn’t delusional, on my part? Is everyone else being dramatic?

545,ahz6kd,Failed recovery because the government shutdown,"I just want to say that I'm not looking for advice, just need to vent.

I've been dealing with disease for about seven year or so. Started in highschool, but I managed to make recovery after I got away from the social pressure one gets from their peers. Was in recovery for nearly three years until my life fell apart. Lost my home, job, car, and my sister passed away. I went back to my old ways. I felt I didn't have control over my life so I turned back forward managing my weight.  It was the one thing I had control over.

Fast forward through multiple suicide attempts and hospitalizations and we get to the holidays. It had been a year and a half since I relapsed that I made a mental break through. I had be living on the government for my food, but I was only spending a small portion of what I was given. That, and the constant worry and pressure from family led me to decide to recover once again. 

I had been making good progress from Christmas up until last week. I hadn't received my food benefits for January. When I when to the Public Aid office they told me three things. First, I hadn't received my benefits from December either, I just had money left from the months before. Second it was a result of the government shutdown. And third, I probably wasn't going to be accepted even though I have no income.

I'd would just get a job, but I'm disabled and can't even function at home let alone in a work environment. I was rejected for disability benefits as most people are their first time applying. So I'm stuck in a hole. Anorexia was causing problems with both my physical and mental health, on top of the many other health concerns of mine. I was working to fix that, but now I can't afford to. 

Suicidal thoughts are coming back, and I'm giving up hope that I'll ever get better. It appears that I'm just meant to be a failure. Feeling quite worthless. I don't really even care that much. I still have the desire to loose weight, and I do want to die. This might just make sure one or both of those happen. I'm just afraid because I've tried starving myself to death, and it was a slow and painful experience. I also don't want to leave my cats behind, but that's about all that keeps my tethered to the land of the living.

Anyway, for lending me your time. ",1548002188,1/20/2019 10:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ahz6kd/failed_recovery_because_the_government_shutdown/,6

552,ahgi5b,I don't know if this belongs here.,"For about a year I severely restricted calories; I'd overestimate how much I ate as a result. I'd jot down 1200 calories but it was more than likely 900 or so. Occasionally I'd binge at a restaurant or on a long weekend. As a result I went from 180 pounds to 130. As time went on I noticed I was very fatigued and my hair started growing in dry and brittle. I also developed ridged nails and black circles under my eyes. But I kept going. 

In August of 2018 I moved and started eating how I wanted; a bagel with hummus in the morning and a plain sandwich (veggie patty and bread, no greens) in the afternoon with a black coffee. I didn't have fruits or greens most days and would fast for a minimum of 36 hours a week. At some point I stopped losing weight and maintained. 

Forward to December; I developed 24 hour brain fog, dizziness, lightheaded, and overall weakness, which I'm still experiencing today. Sometimes the ground feels as though it's moving under me and other times my head feels unstable on my body. I think I might be severely nutrient deficient but I'm not sure. I might also be lacking vitamin D from staying indoors all the time.

Last night I had an extremely horrible night terror about all the purging I have been doing. All my teeth were falling out in a bloody mess. It started with one wiggling out and then almost all my teeth on the top row were falling out. In the dream I went to my mom sobbing with all the bloody teeth in my hands and confessed my anorexia to her and how sorry I was, then the dream ended there. It felt much longer than that and I had woken up from it twice. Ive never been woken up so shaken from a dream before.

565,anutpj,Eating Disorders Are Not A Choice,"(Edit: the title is supposed to read that ""Eating Disorders ARE a Choice"")

For me personally, this mindset taught to me at my treatment center last year has changed my whole perspective on my own recovery. 

I’ve been dealing with a multitude of eating disorders since I was eleven years old. I know the pain, the confusion, and the chaos that comes with behaving in a way that is slowly killing you.
That perfection that you’re looking for, or imperfection, that allows you to tell yourself that what you’re doing is okay is beyond wrong. And the thing is, you probably know deep down that what you’re doing is wrong. 

I knew, even though it felt good, the fact that I was hiding what I was doing was a blaring sign that I knew it was wrong. That fear makes it beyond impossible to reach out for help when you think that you’re going to be shamed by it. After all, as many people know, this isn’t the same as being diagnosed with cancer.

This is a choice, you can either choose to get better or choose your eating disorder over your relationships. This is the harsh truth that I’ve come to realize.

I was taught about the “starving brain” and how it can cloud your judgments, making it nearly impossible to think you can change what you’re doing. If you’re already entangled in your eating disorder, it can be so hard to be able to change what you’re doing by yourself. Asking for help can be so so scary, but it is also so so worth it. You might not see it now, it took me years to realize this, but your medical team is on your side, it’s not supposed to be a battle.
	
I fought for months with my medical team, with my family, with myself. It just ended up being exhausting and no help at all. I repeatedly told myself in my head that this was not a choice, but I also told myself that I could just go right back to my eating disorder after all of this was done. If it really isn’t a choice, then why did I have that thought? That I could just choose to go back to the thing that was killing me? I didn’t want to die, I wanted to live so badly.

And I am living and am fully present in everything that I experience. I got my first apartment, I have an amazing boyfriend, and my own dog who I named after the treatment center that saved my life. I still struggle, but I’ve come to the point where the joy and happiness in my relationships outweigh the “high” that came from my disorder. I thought that I deserved to suffer, that I was bad and not worth it, and that felt good somehow in my messed up mind.

My mind is so much clearer now, and while everyone’s experience is different, I hope this helps somebody out there. And if you’re the one suffering, I am so fucking sorry. Please, please get help so that you can start living your life again.

Life is so beautiful and so are you. I hope you see that soon.

This isn’t a post to judge or put people down for their own recovery methods, but this helped me feel empowered with my decision towards my own recovery.",1549483335,2/6/2019 14:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/anutpj/eating_disorders_are_not_a_choice/,0

Nauseating pain that claims my entire body.
The sensation of being both hollow and full.
Never feeling right.
Not anymore. 

I can hear my body screaming.
That’s not a metaphor; I can honest to God hear the groans that my body is projecting.
“Why don’t you love me?”
“When will you nourish and take care of me?”
I just need to keep ignoring those voices.
They have to shut up at some point.

 Are the stars shining that bright or am I just closer to them?
I feel weightless whenever my form tries to give out.
It’s almost like I’m leaping into the numbness that I crave.
It’s so peaceful when everything around me goes black.

How fucked up is it that I’ve gained a sense of pride in the bruises that I wear?
I used to sob and helplessly try to cover it whenever life’s cruelties painted a new one on my flesh.
Yet, now I see it as proof that I’m sick.
Proof that progress - that ANYTHING is happening.

 My hair is abandoning my head and festering on the rest of my physique.
Ugly, I know, but at least it keeps me warm.
Having hands and feet that freeze in 80 degree temperatures kind of sucks.
But hey, it’s progress.

 My collarbones are my favorite feature that I have.
They’re so delicate and ready to break.
Fragile.
Whenever I want to die or give up, I can look to them and remind myself of WHY I’m doing this.

 Just like everything else in my life, my organs are trying to leave me.
I’d okay if they did.
I’d be skinnier.

 They’re threatening me with retaining me in the home but I can’t bring myself to care.
It’s not the tube that scares me, it’s the calories.
The loss of control.
He took it away from me once; nobody will take it ever again.


 I’m in control and I may not be happy, but I’m okay.
Do you believe me?

577,an3uju,I just can't anymore- what to do? RANT,"First of all, this post was crossposted (edited a little bit) to r/AskDocs.

&amp;#x200B;

I've posted here before, but I kind of need to rant.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an eating disorder and suffer from severe anxiety and depression. I was hospitalized for 3 weeks for the anxiety/depression and got out on Thursday Jan 31. During this time, my eating disorder got worse, but I was on a general psych ward, so the doctors were not trained specifically about eating disorders (at least not a lot). I started restricting food on January 20, due to my eating disorder and managed to eat some soup on Jan 24. I almost immediately vomited up the soup (induced vomiting due to disgusted feeling).

From Jan 24th, to today (Feb 3), I have not eaten anything (and keep it down without vomiting).

I've started getting super dizzy, my vision blacks out for minutes at a time, and my heart feels like it's about to explode. I can barely walk without support and I had to run to catch a bus (it was like a 10 meter run) on Friday and I was so close to passing out.

I went to the hospital on Saturday due to the heart pain and palpitations, and severe weakness. They did blood tests, vitals, and an ECG and they said everything was normal and sent me home after giving me an IV because I hadn't eaten in 9 days. They said I was medically stable, gave me some tylenol for the pain, and said here was no reason to keep me in the hospital emerg.

**Here's the problem:** My heart still hurts like nobody's business, it's so bad it makes my breath catch, I can't walk without feeling faint, my head aches and I feel dizzy just walking a couple steps. I can't keep any liquids or solids down (including an electrolyte drink, which is supposed to help).

WHAT THE HELL DO I DO NOW. The hospital won't help me. Feels like I have to be emaciated in order for them to help me. I feel like I'm dying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to an outpatient mental health (general not eating disorders specifically) program next week, but I'm on a waiting list for an eating disorder program but that's 8 months of a wait. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I have an eating disorder, havent eaten in 10 days, can't keep food down and have major chest pain, dizziness, blacking out of vision and such. Went to hospital, was told I was fine and got sent home. NOW WHAT.",1549300724,2/4/2019 11:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/an3uju/i_just_cant_anymore_what_to_do_rant/,4

I feel like I couldn’t ever be together with that guy because of my anorexia. I know I would only compete with him whenever I’d look at his figure. I can’t develop romantic feelings for someone who’s skinny too, because it makes me want to be skinnier than him, by far.

So I’ve been restricting food for 9 days now (since Jan 24), meaning I literally have not eaten a bite of food since then. 

I ended up having jello this morning- vomited that up.

I really felt bad (so weak I had to crawl around and could only stand using a cane my parents had lying around), my vision would black for minutes at a time and my heart started doing weird things, I guess it was an irregular heartbeat. 

So i told my parents I would have some soup and a small bun, and I just ate that and immediately after I vomited it up. 

I called a nurse helpline this morning and had an assessment and they told me to go to the hospital immediately. But I was just in the hospital for 3 weeks (not for ED but for depression and anxiety). 

I really don’t want to be in the hospital again, they’ll give me an IV or force feed me through a tube. But I can’t seem to eat anything. 

So lost. 

I feel a bit better now, but honestly I’ll probably be bad again by the evening.

I’m so afraid of the calories. But I had to have 40 calories today because I could hardly walk to catch the bus and when I saw it coming I ran like 10 meters and almost fainted. So I had a bit of an electrolyte drink.

It’s hard for me to type or speak or think clearly. I feel extremely dizziness when i’m move or turn quickly, like everything feels upside down. 

Does anyone know if this is because of my Ana? I’m eating “decently” and i know i’m hydrated. I don’t feel like myself. this has been going on at least 3 months. Should i tell my doctor? how would i even bring this up? what could this be?

605,aqd5b0,when you're a failed anorexic,"TW: BMI, numbers, calories

THIS IS LONG. I AM SORRY.

Back in September, I started treatment to help with an eating disorder. I have struggled with eating disorders since the age of 11, which was 5 years ago. When I was 11, my heart rate had dropped to 37bmp and went even lower while asleep... but here's the catch: I was deemed a ""healthy"" weight. My BMI was 19.5 (which might seem extremely high to some of you) and the doctors at the children's hospital diagnosed me with Anorexia nervosa, even though one criterion of the diagnosis was to be underweight according to the BMI chart. I had starved myself for so long, that my mother was told by a doctor (a conversation which I overheard while ""asleep"") that if I hadn't come in sooner, I would've had heart failure within less than a week. I quasi-recovered after experiencing that stay at the hospital, and I don't really remember a lot from then. But back in September, my BMI was a bit higher than what it was back when I was 11. After dodging dinners for 2 weeks once I was finished with PHP treatment during the day, eating only 2x (1000cal) as much as I typically did, and not 4x (which was recommended), and refusing to eat more than 2 meals a day, I was discharged from the center. When trying to figure out my diagnosis, the NP put me under as ""EDNOS"" due to my weight, but then changed it to Anorexia nervosa after doing a real evaluation. Since I was discharged from PHP and IOP in January, my BMI went from 20.0 to 18.9 (which doesnt seem like much, but sets off major alarms for my therapists and my mother. plus it's difficult trying to lose weight after ""recovery"") I never truly saw myself as having a ""real"" eating disorder, let alone Anorexia, since I didn't weigh as little as other anorexics do.

I just feel like a... failed ""anorexic"", like I didn't try hard enough to lose more weight, especially since all the girls in IOP were skinnier than me. I look like a whale, plus... the people who I trusted and told about my experience to, brushed it off and said I looked ""fine"" and like i ""don't have an eating disorder"". It really hurts... so fuckin bad--to be invalidated, I mean. 


Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Maybe even have some input on the whole weight issue and diagnosis material? Or know how to help in the slightest bit to make me feel a little sane?

I have only been here for a couple of days and have barely eaten anything and now my friends here, although they are aware of my ED, are getting more and more worried and try to feed me what they think of as healthy foods.   


I want to stock my fridge up with ""safe foods"" that won't cause me terrible anxiety when I eat them.  
I will still eat too little, but it will be better than nothing.  
The problem is that I am not sure what to buy.   


At home in Germany, I of course have my safe foods all figured out and know exactly which brands and specific products to buy, over here I just feel overwhelmed by all the unfamiliar products.   


I don't want to spend hours in the supermarket reading labels on food packaging to find low calorie items, so I thought I would ask here if you have any US supermarket staples that I could try. '  


I try to avoid carbs almost completely, so I prefer low carb foods. Added sugar in particular is a no-go for me.   


The supermarkets my friends frequent are Safeway and Trader Joe's.  


One thing I am very excited about is the vast choice of sugar free drinks here.

644,ash3xr,so I passed out during class...,"My body decided to just pass out for a few minutes during my 7th period the other day. It was quite hilarious because I made myself look like a complete dumbass. I woke up to my teacher cradling me like a child and trying to feed me candy to get my blood pressure back to normal since it was EXTREMELY low, even 15min after the incident of me going to the nurse's office. I literally spit the candy out, yeeted that shit up. I have a golf ball sized knot on my forehead from hitting the counter along with 5 new bruises. This was last week and I am still dealing with dizziness sadly, which sucks because I can't exercise without getting nervous about my body giving out. Now I have to eat over 500cal before school ends now, I guess. 

I hate myself so much, I genuinely feel like a FAILED anorexic, especially since I am not underweight and never have been. I honestly don't know what to do. I keep telling myself that I need to eat so this doesn't happen again next week (school break... time for a 7 day ""binge"" lmao) But at the same time, the few minutes I was out for, it felt so serene and peaceful, and I would starve myself again just to chase that feeling for another time.

654,arvgkd,i have anorexia.,"so uh, i dont really know why ive decided to finally post on my Reddit acct but here i am. 
i have always struggled with body image. when i was 11 puberty started to hit and i gained weight. i looked heavier than i was. it bothered me a lot, and i would tell my mom i wanted to lose weight. the only issue was that i liked food. a lot. 
back in April or May of 2018, my best friend attempted to kill himself, claiming that since i wouldn’t go out with him there was “nothing for him” on this planet. me, being obviously concerned, called a suicide prevention hotline, who called the police. 
i went away that summer, to my grandmas on an island far far away from my hometown. i started to stew in the guilt from knowing that he could have died because of me. obviously he was toxic and he’s done other things (another story for another time) that have stopped our friendship. i didn’t realize that then. 
when i got back from the island, i saw myself in a completely new way. i started to fall into a cycle of depressive behaviours, and lash out for seemingly no reason. then the ED behaviours came.
it started out slow. skipping breakfast, “oh i already ate”. but then it turned into eating maybe one meal a day. it became an obsession. i got an app to count calories. i counted the bites i took and minimized the amount i was “allowed” to take.
then there was a day when i was out. i was with friends and they wanted ice cream. i was reluctant but got it anyway. i felt awful after. so i went home and gagged into the toilet until i had no more ice cream left. 
i felt so powerful. finally, this was something i could control. obviously, that isn’t healthy. 
it was November 2018 before i told anyone. i was in Mexico, because my dad was getting married and i had lost track of how many calories i had consumed as we were at an all inclusive and i ate at random times during the day. i binged for 4 days. completely out of control eating. then for the last 3 days, i hid in my room, curtains closed, lights off. i didn’t let anyone in not even the maids. i didn’t want to have to leave. i purged every hour, until all i was vomiting was bile. 
i looked so sick. that’s when i told my best friend what was happening. she convinced me to leave my room and go get some soup. 
i did, and i kept it down. 
thank god i have her &lt;3
it was December 2018 when i told my boyfriend, and of course he was understanding. im so lucky i have him. more about him in another post. 
it was January 2019 when i told my dad, then my mom. 
ive been in treatment ever since then. ive seen 3 doctors, 2 nutritionists and ive continued to see my counsellor and take part in art therapy. 
im recovering, but i dont feel like im recovering. every day is hard. some days are bad days, but i get through it. im doing okay now, and i hope one day i never have to worry about food again",1550481778,2/18/2019 3:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/arvgkd/i_have_anorexia/,2

I know nothing about anorexia. I never thought I'd have it because of my love of food. But now eating just makes me stressed, and we're scared I'm going down that path. I have some symptoms I think may be, but I just want to see what they are first to confirm

664,ar7xvn,To My Sister That Won't Be Sent (Anorexia),"Okay so here it is so I'm not holding out on you because I know you love me. I didn't want you to know, so I'm super fucking embarrassed Jay saw it. Sometimes I post about it, mostly when I'm relapsing really hard. Back when I was in Havenwyck even, it was a lot because I didn't eat and was just TOO TIRED to do anything with what went on. Y'aknow, the murder-suicide, dad asking to drink again over it and holding out that I was sexually assaulted because it is just TOO MUCH. I just sleep now and don't eat. It doesn't even take effort, it takes effort TO eat now, and when my stomach is full I freak out because I feel empty and it doesn't feel right to be full in any sense. I am so full of love for so many things and trying so hard to love the world (cats mostly) but I have had such a strong hate for myself for like, 15 years. So I guess I'm like, an anorexic cat lady that also likes other animals. I post on forums for help because I feel like you're all just happy I'm thin or something, and I KNOW that if I go back to recovery I'm going to gain so much weight, I don't want help. And also, none of you will ever ""get it."" (loose clothes is like CRACK to me) I gained 14 pounds in 6 days at Havenwyck. I DO NOT want to be a member of the Clean Plate Club. The thought of gaining weight gives me heartburn. Trying to get past this feels like I am failing, and maybe if I had told the people trying to help me that THIS was the problem years ago, I'd have gotten help by now. I haven't had a meal in the past 15 years that hasn't made me hate myself. I am just too tired. I was so good just not caring if I was fat, but I've relapsed. And I'm trying. I will be okay. I have my cats, music, and mom sort-of knows. So I sleep and drink.

666,ar1769,Some things to try if you need to get hunger sensations. May help to see what your condition actually is.,"If you are going to try any of these things then read the whole section and pay attention to the warnings I might give, as I am not a specialist and the methods listed may or may not be proven. The ones where it's important to note posibble side affects are tagged. 

This list is, Not in any particular order, reader discretion advised.

Note that these methods can be tested to see if you may have anorexia related hunger issues or other chemical/ hormonal instability such as ghrelin deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, etc.

The explainations are going g to be kept as short as possible without sacrificing info.


List without explainations:

1. Chew gum
2. Light exercise, cardio and abs (SEE DETAILS)
3. Masturbate(SEE DETAILS)
4.Work hard/ do things you enjoy
5. Eat crackers or bread, and other dry foods like peanut butter or cereal
6. Consume acidic and vitamin c rich foods that are mostly natural, lemonade, citrus fruits, etc (SEE DETAILS)
7. Take supplements as needed, like iron or various vitamins

Details section:


1: Chewing gum for a long period of time is known to make some people thirsty or hungry. This mostly has to do with constant stimulation of saliva enzymes like amylaze and pepsin.

2. If you decide to work out make sure you pace yourself, because if you are faced with muscular atrophy or other muscle related symptoms, your body may not be able to keep up if you don't eat as much. Do something like a mix of stretches, crunches, short runs etc.

3. Masturbation should only be considered if muscle atrophy, sex hormone balance, and brain fog aren't a problem. I say brain fog because it's also a result of hormone issues. Be careful.

4. Everything you do yields some sort of chemical reaction in your brain, and getting some good work done or doing things you enjoy activates dopamine release, which is often associated with the reward of food. So there you go.

5. Eating even small amounts of dry foods with maybe a sip of water afterwards will make some people hungrier, again dealing with saliva enzymes.

6. Lemonade especially along with naturally acidic foods are known to make you hungrier.

7.this is obvious.

purging and restricting has.

i want to be able to eat, but i also wanna be 100. i wish i could have both but i feel like i can’t.

i know logically that w sustained exercise and healthy eating (IE: stop binging pls n thank u) i can steadily lose weight. 

but i want to be thin *NOW* and i don’t want to be a “healthy weight” (i think i technically am now) i wanna be *fucking thin*

672,aqlmcr,A new review calls for the gut microbiome to be considered as part of standard nutritional rehabilitation for anorexia nervosa. The gut microbiome in anorexia nervosa: relevance for nutritional rehabilitation (Jan 2019),"Article: https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/en/a-new-review-calls-for-the-gut-microbiome-to-be-considered-as-part-of-standard-nutritional-rehabilitation-for-anorexia-nervosa/

Review: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-018-5159-2

&gt; **Abstract**
&gt; 
&gt; Rapidly accumulating evidence supports the important role of gut microbiome in the regulation of mood, behaviour, appetite, gastrointestinal symptomology, and nutrient metabolism. These are all core features frequently altered in individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). Current treatment recommendations for AN support the use of high-calorie diets as an essential part of nutritional rehabilitation, commonly achieved by elevating the fat content of the diet. However, in contrast to this approach, there is accumulating evidence suggesting the importance of balanced, high-fibre diets on the gut microbiome. Studies have demonstrated profound differences in the microbial composition of underweight people with AN and those of normal- or overweight individuals. Specific alterations vary widely between studies. It is thus far unclear to what extent the observed differences are brought on by iatrogenic effects of nutritional rehabilitation or the disorder itself. To date, only two studies have investigated the changes in the intestinal microbiota during nutritional rehabilitation and corresponding weight restoration. These studies suggest that the gut microbiome of AN patients was different to healthy controls both prior and following nutritional rehabilitation, though it is noted that these states were associated with lower and higher nutritional intakes, respectively. There is a clear need for further investigation regarding the effects of nutritional rehabilitation on the gut microbiome. Such research would provide insights into the potential role of gut microbiome in modulating the pathophysiology of AN and inform future treatment strategies.

**Takeaway**: Keep a look out for FMT (fecal microbiota transplant) opportunities. Scroll through the recent posts in /r/fecaltransplant to learn more about what the current status of FMT is. Including a community project to acquire high quality donors. ",1550162246,2/14/2019 10:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/aqlmcr/a_new_review_calls_for_the_gut_microbiome_to_be/,2

676,ave9e1,hair advice,"can anyone who dyes their hair give me some advice? 

background: i’ve cut off almost all the fried parts of my hair, but my hair still feels brittle and dry. it feels soft at the root and my hair does grow. i am doing my best not to apply too much heat to it (but it’s wavy and my bangs that i’m growing out curl up so i have to flat iron them). i feel like even when i cut off the dead ends of my hair, my newly cut ends STILL feel rough. my hair is neck length and only the last 1-3 inches are super dead feeling. i’m trying not to cut it again bc i just cut it from shoulder length after getting my hair bleached, and i want it to grow longggggg. 

obviously my diet sucks but i DO binge so that’s probs why my hair still grows lol. i take women’s one a day vitamins and i just started natures bounty hair skin and nails vitamins last week. i try to not wash my hair often (maybe 3 times a week). i put coconut oil on my entire head after my shower and don’t rinse it out until the next time i wash my hair. 

-how can i keep my entire head feeling and looking healthy like my roots? 
-are there any hair treatments or products i can use to get my hair feeling soft all the way down to my ends? 
-are there any beneficial nutrients my body and hair needs that i can get from vitamins and not food?
-are there any products that slow down or seal split ends until i’m ready to get a trim in a few months? (i know you can’t reverse split ends, i just don’t want them to keep splitting up my hair shaft)

thank you!

But it’s getting harder to hide it from people. I went to the doctor yesterday and she started asking questions. “Are you eating? You look weak. Your face has no colour” and I lied saying I’d just been really tired. Exercising has become so hard because i get really light headed. I wish I had control. I wish I could stop. But it’s so hard. And it’s weird because I know That if I don’t control myself I can go weeks without eating because my mind has trained my body to ignore hunger. My friends always ask about why I sleep so much at times. And the truth is that I sleep so I don’t have to eat. I need help. I don’t want to be this way anymore,1551247621,2/27/2019 0:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ava15v/i_need_help/,9
678,av9ou0,Just struggling,"I have struggled with anorexia for years, it started around the time I turned 13 and I am 22 now. I should have gone to a recovery center when my doctor mentioned it at around age 16 but my mother yelled at him (that's a whole different story). I got into college and after a few mental breakdowns, went to see my first psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with MDD, GAD, and C-PTSD. 
I eventually got on the right medication, thank god, but have noticed it has caused me to gain weight. Or, at least, I blame it on the medication. For context, I weighed around 120 pounds when I first came to college and, as of yesterday, I weigh 155 pounds.
At first I thought I was bloated, normal for a female, but now I realize that it's just my stomach. It's just me. Ican see my stomach poking through my shirt and it is really, really starting to bother me. 
I have no idea how to cope with this. I want so badly to restrict again. I'm terrified of going to a counselor because all they ever want to do is send me to a nutritionist or whatever. I'm not going to one of them. I'm terrified of relapsing. I notice more and more every day how terrible I think I look.
9 years is a long time to struggle with this and I'm getting so tired.
Can anyone at all offer me any advice? Any at all? ",1551245258,2/26/2019 23:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/av9ou0/just_struggling/,1

(Haven’t exercised properly for 8ish months),"I want to start exercising again for energy, endorphins and self-confidence, and to get out of this hazy, foggy, awful post-heavy-restriction rut, but I’m so worried about revving up my appetite/possibly triggering a binging phase and having Ed anxiety shoot off the richter again :( restriction has given me a few blissful months of numbness and anxiety reduction as my weight dropped, but now my hair is falling out and everyone is concerned again. I’ve just started seeing a new trauma/ed specialist though, so I do have some support. 

I’ve been doing a bunch of research into things like lean gains, best types of exercise for muscle wastage (I want my butt back 😅) and how to deal with appetite increases with exercise.. but I just feel so anxious about it all and am wondering if anyone had stories to share about healthy incorporation of exercise in recovery?

682,aug58v,So I have a question...,"(I accidentally clicked spoiler and also this is long sorry.)

This might sound dumb, but do you think that anorexia is sort of contagious?

I know this might seem super weird, but I think that that may have been how it started for me. One of my best friends had some super serious issues with her anorexia when she was recovering, and I spent a lot of time around her during that. As much as I hate to say it, and I would never tell her this, but it think was so mentally damaging to see her like that. Seeing her like that may have been one of the big factors that started my anorexia.

I just thought, ""Wow she's so pretty, but she never eats."" 

She has always been really popular and pretty, and she has so many friends. I've never been jealous of her, but rather the lifestyle she has, because I always feel so alone. I always thought it was because of my looks that people don't like me. I still think that. 

I know it would probably be wrong to say that she was the only or biggest factor, though. 

I've always had huge self esteem issues. I suppose I've never really been a big person (the most I've ever weighed is 113 and I'm 5'3""), but I've always hated myself. I would always see pictures on the media of perfect girls with perfect abs and perfect bodies with flat stomachs. I always wanted that.

In fact, I was born with extra organs in my abdomen, which makes it nearly impossible to have a flat stomach or any kind of waist. I always thought that I can never be normal because the dumb mistake that God or whoever made out of my body. I figured out that starving myself worked though, and in the vexation of long deserved victory over my body, I craved more and more.

Another factor may be that I, at a very young age, was severely voilated. 

I have PTSD from being voilently sexually assaulted. As a result of this, I have never felt clean or worthy. My body has never felt like a home, and I'm not sure that it ever will. I didn't care what happened to me, and I saw my weight as a game, a game that I was winning.

It's unfair to say that my best friend caused me to be anorexic, because it was probably just waiting to happen. However, I don't think that it is false to say that she may have been what lit the spark and determined me.

685,au9xs3,Pointless Rant (long),"my mind has been hella jumbled recently. this is gonna be more than just ana but idk this is the sub i feel most comfortable posting in.

i feel like i’m on a roller coaster, and it shows if u look @ my post history lol. somedays i can eat and feel healthy and skinny. recently i’ve gone back to restricting. 

i physically feel nauseous and in pain when i eat so i’m not. i also feel disgusting when i eat. i miss the feeling of throwing up but i hate how high effort purging is lol. 

also i’m diagnosed bipolar2 but i never really agreed w it bc i never really felt manic. hahah idk if it’s true mania but boy has that??? felt different recently. sometimes i just feel crazy like i’m riding a high and idgaf about anything i’m just??? going for it. 

and then like suddenly i feel like i’ve hit a wall and crash. i’ve been burning again and i’ve just bought a knife bc my dad took my old one. i’m debating buying a scale or not bc, once again, my dad took it. 

my emotions go from high to low so fucking fast i hate it. i hate it so much. i also hate myself. i hate my body and who i am. i feel like i look disgusting. i’m fucking fat as all hell and i hate my face. i have some acne but horrible acne scars. i’ve almost never broken out until last year when my recovery started. eating food makes me break out and it only fuels my ambition to never eat.

even if my break outs calm down my once smooth and clear skin has scars all over it. i can’t leave my house without makeup. i had work at 5:30am today and still made sure to put on makeup. some days i’ll take it off when i get home only to find out someone wants to do something w me so i redo it again. this can happen several times a day.

i just want to be (feel) pretty *soooo* bad. i’m just broken at this point. i feel like there’s no fucking point and that it’s a lost cause and i’m ugly forever. i want my teeth whitened (all i ever drink is coffee, tea, water) and i still need to get invisaline to straighten them but i hate how they look w them in. there’s no winning.

i feel disgusting. the only time i feel kinda good is w a full face of makeup and an empty stomach. 

i’m showering constantly just to hopefully scrub the dirty feeling off of me. 

i don’t understand. i’m taking my meds regularly and i’ve felt mostly fine for months and i feel like i’m crumbling. i’m gonna text my therapist after this to talk to her about it but my next psych appt is in 2 months. i do need to get my bloodwork done before i can see her tho so i can’t bump up the appt just yet. 

idk for all i know i’ll feel amazing tomorrow. i hate how fucking unstable i feel. i want normal. fuck.

also????? i fucking hate men. i literally don’t want to date anyone (for now) bc i know i’m unstable and will ruin any relationship i touch. i do have FWB which is working out fine but i do admit im interested in this one guy a dat bit more, but???? he’s so flakey and it throws my mind for a loop. my mindset constantly jumps back and forth between “idgaf i don’t want to date him anyway, i’m just here for fun and so is he, we can both do what we want!” and “i just want to be with him and have his attention”..... like he flips between acting like he genuinely cares about me and he dgaf he just wants to fuck. which is fine!!! i just want to know if the shit he says to me is real or if he’s just saying that to make me feel good. i know i should just ask but i don’t want to hahahahahhhaha 

also!?!? my self imagine is sooo fucking out of wack. i honest to god can’t believe anyone is interested in me. like i don’t feel hot, funny, skinny or interesting. but ppl say i am and when they do??? i feel like they’re just saying it to make me feel better and so they can feel superior while????? idk how to explain it. i feel like the way i view ppl and myself is fucked up. like i put ppl into “categories” which is probably wrong but idk.

okay. rant over. thnx for coming to my ted talk lol.",1551028103,2/24/2019 11:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/au9xs3/pointless_rant_long/,39
686,au9ri4,Not wanting to go wedding dress shopping,"I'm getting married in September. I haven't picked out my wedding dress yet, I haven't even gone shopping for one because I'm so terrified of trying on dresses.  I feel like whatever I pick out I'm going to look horrible in because I'm not at my low weight.  I've been weight restored for about a year. I'm in recovery but had a slight hiccup over the summer last year, however I bounced back from that. My body seems to be healing and overall I'm feeling much better than I have in a long time.
However, I'm super stressed with planning the wedding.  It's getting harder to stay afloat some days with recovery and sometimes I just want to say screw it. (And I have). I'm afraid that dress shopping is going to set me off completely.  It doesn't help that the people around me are dieting specifically for my wedding and seem to want to tell me that. While I understand that some of these people legitimately do need to lose weight and would benefit from it health wise it's still very triggering to hear and the way that they SAY it just doesn't come across nicely. People tend to forget that I was very sick for a while and I struggled hard to gain weight and be okay with it. They don't understand that I might not want to hear these comments when I'm stressed.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with these feelings?  I feel so bad that I don't want to do wedding stuff,  but the idea of looking for dresses and having everyone judge me is terrifying.",1551027116,2/24/2019 10:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/au9ri4/not_wanting_to_go_wedding_dress_shopping/,1

701,ay7q37,Healthily Disordered (?),"TW: Talk of weight, calories

(20f) I have struggled with disordered eating and my behavior towards food since 10th grade (when I acted out on the thoughts that had been around since I was 9 - I was terrified of the weight I was gaining for some reason but never did much about it). I won't say what I did exactly, but I had lost a large amount of weight in a short amount of time (while still being in a healthy range for my height). The thing is, recovery was forced on me but I wasn't upset about it?

I relapsed a bit three years ago, then settled for a few months only to have it come back maybe 2 or 3 months ago.

The thing about my stuff is that my goal weight is still healthy for my height, and I'm only afraid of gaining when I go over a certain number on the scale. I have a set caloric intake that is actually pretty okay, though there are days where I'll just eat dinner.

I try not to eat when I'm at my mother's, but I'll happiky eat with my boyfriend or with specific friends (just so long as I can work off my intake or stay under the budget).

I don't think what I do now in my recent return to whatever this is is as unhealthy as what I did during my first, I actually think it's still healthy.

Is where I'm at now considered an eating disorder? The fear of gaining enough to put me back over a certain weight? I really wish I could explain in depth but it would be too triggering.

707,axh7fa,Feeling like my ED is invalid because of my weight,"I’ve been struggling with a plethora of eating disorders my whole life, but I’ve never really been “skinny skinny” if that makes sense, even though it’s been my goal since i was incredibly young. Within the last few years of high school it’s gotten worse and worse partially because I constantly see girls who are so much smaller than me. To be completely honest i try so hard not to show it (and even began dressing more promiscuous to try to feign confidence) but i just hate my body so much. My ED is my biggest secret offline, not even my best friend or mom know about it. 
 
I find relief in seeing that other people can relate to what I’ve been going through because i do see people post about this specific topic often especially on twitter.  It’s just that now that i have found safe places to talk about my issues anonymously I somehow feel more invalidated than ever simply because I’m not as small as other people who also suffer from EDs. Not to mention a lot of ED accounts on social media constantly post body checks and it just really crushes me. 
 
It seems so juvenile and stupid to care so much but I just want to be skinny so bad. I’ve wanted it probably more than anything my entire life. I want to wear a bikini and not hate how i look. I want to be able to have sex with the lights on. Just little things that I would do anything for. I wish I didn’t care so much, I wish i could just be happy with my body because it seems that no matter how long I starve for nothing changes. 
 
Not really sure if I’m seeking advice or just venting, but I’m just at a total loss for what to do. Nothing hurts me more than faking a smile just to lock myself away and cry in the mirror. I’m so tired of battling this for my whole life. I want it to be over. All my insecurities would be gone if i could just be skinny.

Mostly I don’t want to go 

I keep having this image of me screaming and crying and kicking while they make me eat food

Or put a tube in me and I have to pull it out or it’ll make me fat  

I keep hearing my treatment team telling me my diagnosis, that I’m underweight, that I keep dropping, how worried they are 

My heart is working too hard. My liver and kidneys are working too hard. So hard they can’t keep doing it. I know it. They think I don’t understand but I do. It’s not about not understanding. 

I just feel so big 

I feel like they’re lying to me that I’m dropping weight to try and trick me into eating what I have been 

I weigh myself so frequently throughout the day and the numbers are always changing but I just want them to go down, I feel like they go every which way except down

But they tell me it’s down 

They say I’ve lost 10 ibs in a month 

But I’m sure I’m the same. Sometimes I feel like I’m bigger than I was last month 

I hate food now. I used to love it but all it does is make me sad and anxious and angry. Sometimes I just look at food menus on uber eats and I put it in my cart but I never buy anything and sometimes I go to the store and I buy 200$ worth of food but I never eat any of it. Sometimes it goes bad and I have to throw it out.  

When I look up my bmi in the DSM it just says that my ed is “moderate” so if it’s just moderate then it’s not that bad. 

Not bad enough to go to a hospital where girls there will be so skinny and thin and I will be a whale compared to them 

I feel like I need to lose more weight first. I have to lose more before I can go to hospital. I keep saying 5 more ibs... but the number keeps going up 10 more ibs... 30 more ibs but I don’t have that to lose. It scares me. But I feel like I have to keep going 

My NP told me I was going to die if I didn’t gain weight 

I don’t want to die. I want to get better, I do

But really.. I think I would rather die than gain weight, than be fat, than be *fatter* 

And so I guess I have to go 

But I don’t want to 

Who will I be if I’m not little anymore 

I feel like I will be nothing 

But I am nothing now ",1551719552,3/4/2019 11:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ax9j93/possibly_being_hospitalized_soon_again/,14
711,ax7dip,Is this normal? (Recovery Question),"I’m freaking out- I’ve been reading that “it’s normal” but this happened suddenly.
I was eating and doing really well, 3 meals 2/3 snacks, my body was responding fairly well then blam! One day I woke up and I looked 5 months pregnant and it hasn’t gone away. I feel so uncomfortable and in pain but I’m hungry and I know I have to eat, so I do. 
I look like a potato with 4 toothpicks (arms and legs). My tummy is so hard and extended, it hurts.
My face isn’t puffy, nor are my feet or hands so no edema? I just feel like a ballon has been inflated in my torso. 
I honestly look like I’m in my second trimester. 

No I haven’t weighed myself.

Glorification would be something like, ""I love anorexia. I love the way it makes me feel. I love it."" 

Not glorification: ""I had to eat today. I feel like crap. I don't know what to do anymore."" 

Please, please please double check before reporting. This goes for the other rules as well.

729,avuu91,How to help a friend with Anoreixa Nervosa.,"So my[M13] best friend[F13].. I just talked with her on the phone last night. I recently found out she has anorexia nervosa. She hasn't told anyone besides me and I have no idea what to do. I've been researching for the past hour to find anyway to treat it, or get help. I want to understand the disorder.. I just want to help her. She's not the therapist type of person. She doesn't like them, because she's had bad experiences before due to her sister not getting the help she needed due to having a shitty therapist. I don't know what to do. I want to help her but don't know how. I've been researching it, like treatment plans, the recovery process, and I've read some articles and watched a few videos to try and understand what someone goes through. She says she wants to attain a skinnier body because it makes her feel good, that she feels like she's in control. She'd spit out her food and even told me she rinsed out her mouth one time to get rid of the calories. She started researching about this, and how much calories any little thing has. She won't go above 200 each day and if she does, she'd feel extremely guilty. She overexercises to burn it off, and can't eat a full cup of yoghurt without feeling full. She says she knows it's bad, but still wants to do it anyway. She hasn't taken her meds in a while, (iron, vitamins, etc) because she doesn't want to get better. She wants to get skinnier because her family has an overweight problem, and she doesn't want to become like them. Please, I want to get her the help she needs but I just don't know how. She doesn't want me to get involved, but I can't just stay here and let it get worse. I want her to go to a licensed dietician, or maybe a mental health therapist, but I can't without her or her parents consent.

737,b0k79v,Time for an intervention?,"TLDR: My anorexic friend collapsed at work, and I'm thinking of having an intervention to get her the help she needs whether she likes it or not. 

I have a really close friend of mine who recently told me about her anorexia. As someone who's recovered from bulimia I feel that she trusts me enough to tell me everything. I understand what it's like to be in the midst of an illness like that, but she told me the other day she's currently at a lower weight than she was when she was last admitted to inpatient treatment. 

She collapsed at work today. If I hadn't walked into the kitchen and caught her exactly when I did she could have hit her head and been seriously injured. She always tells me she's ""seeing a doctor next week"" whenever I question her about it, but as someone who's been through a similar illness I know that she could be telling any lies she needs to in order to avoid serious suspicion. 

I'm incredibly concerned about her and thinking of having a bit of an intervention - just having a group of people who care about her all in one place, and some other people I know who've recovered from the illness. 
I don't know whether I should go ahead with it, but at this point if her health comes at the price of her hating me, that's a price I'm willing to pay.

739,b0cdip,"Given an incorrect ED diagnosis, feeling as if my disorder isn’t real.","*In no way am I glorifying eating disorders, simply sharing my story and asking for advice.* 
*Not Pro-Ana*

Since the age of 4 I have had very poor body image/negative thoughts involved with eating. My mother always expressed the hatred she had for herself and the desire to be thinner, despite being 5’1” and 90 pounds. She was very petite. Of course, children imitate what they see. Therefore, I picked up on many unhealthy habits involved with weight and eating at a very young age. 

My entire life I have been at a normal, weight. At 5’0”, I am petite like my mother. Despite having poor body image and negative thoughts as a child, my eating disorder didn’t fully start until I was 14. From the age of 14 until now (21 years old), I have been caught in the cycle of restricting, finally eating something, then purging what little I do eat. I have never been a binge eater. 

In January of 2018 I had to go on a medication that is notorious for weight gain. I was in the grip of a severe drug addiction, and this medication was the last resort to save my life. The medication worked so well for me that it even helped with a lot of the thoughts associated with my eating disorder. I wasn’t so focused on food and calories and weight and I was rarely purging. But as expected, I gained weight. A lot of weight, and very quickly. As a few months went by I went into a full blown panic one day when I had stepped on the scale and saw the highest number that I had ever gotten to. This immediately threw me into my old mindset and my old ways. 

I began restricting to the point of starvation and purging when I felt it was necessary to get the weight off of me. I did lose a majority of the weight I had gained from the medication, but I am still at a normal weight. I recently started seeing a psychiatrist that I used to see in 2017. He knew back then about my eating habits and brought it up at our appointment last week. He told me that I have bulimia. I told him that I don’t believe it could be bulimia, considering the fact that I never binge. He told me it is still bulimia. I’m angry. I feel as if just because I am not underweight that he doesn’t see it more as anorexia, or as EDNOS/OSFED. 

Is this a valid concern to think that I was given the wrong diagnosis? Or is it just my ED mind telling me that my disorder is only valid if I am underweight? I am so confused and tired of feeling like nobody sees how badly I’m struggling because I’m not underweight. Does anyone else feel this way or have any similar experiences with doctors misdiagnosing?

742,b08kkp,[Read caption/description please] I’m afraid my friend had anorexia and she won’t tell me,"So this may come off as creepy or just dumb or panicky, but it’s been eating me alive and I need to talk to someone about it.

Here’s the story, so my friend was in the hospital for around a week in December. That doesn’t necessarily mean anorexia obviously, but there’s a few things that kinda lead to me believe it to be the case. So first of all, I’m still in high school, and I [male] have really strong feelings for her and I care about her a lot. So one day she just didn’t go to school, her sister said she was sick, whatever, thats fine. She later didn’t show up the next day as well (Friday). Same thing, I didn’t bother me that much, it’s only two days. However, that night I got a text from her sister saying she was in the hospital, and she said that she’s telling me because I’m a close friend, but it’s personal so she doesn’t wanna tell me why. 
So I get worried as shit as soon as I see this. Now, I have anxiety, OCD, and Tourette’s, so once something is in my mind I can’t get it out. I immediately start racing through every possibility as to what “personal” reason she’d be in the hospital. Because to me, for 90% if illnesses, I wouldn’t mind if people knew or not. 
So anorexia or malnutrition came across my mind, because I know she’s really thin and she refuses to show her arms (wears sweaters during any temperature). 
However, a week later, we text, she says she’s coming home. I tell her that she has my full support and that if she ever wants to talk about it, I’m here. Still though, she didn’t wanna talk about it.
Here is when my mind starts racing even more.
It’s obviously been months since she came back, and it seemed like there was no recovery period. 
What the hell kinda sickness is bad enough to land you in the hospital for a week, is personal, yet you’re literally fine immediately after. She hasn’t gone back to the hospital. Like (despite her seeming like a very happy person), a suicide attempt was also on my radar on top of anorexia, but same thing, I’m assuming it’d take you a long time to recover, and there be some after math, not just a week and bam! Depression cured. So I quickly crossed that out. 
And obviously anorexia is a psychological thing, and I’m fully in support of all the people recovering. So I know that even though I’ve never seen anyone call her overweight and I think she’s perfect, there could be something making her think she is. 
For the longest time, I just said that she was malnourished. I deduced that it was regardless of anorexia. She just happened to not eat properly, for on an IV drip, started eating right and was back on track.

743,b070ur,Don't know for sure what's going on.,"So, back in 2017 I lost a lot of weight, intentionally, I was depressed af (still am) so i stopped eating, I loved watching the numbers going down,  somehow, it made me feel better, but in April of 2018 I started eating normally and I felt like shit again. I tried to get back in track but I couldn't.

My point is, I'm still eating normally, of course I feel like I'm actually eating a lot, but I do hate my body, I wish I was thinner, and yet,  everytime I tried to not to eat, I can't. As if my brain knows what I'm doing and it's trying to prevent it from happening.

I'm like "" hey! That's a good thing, you should love your body the way it is, because it's perfect, boo"" but then I'm like ""you should starve yourself to death"" 

These two mindsets are driving me crazy, I can't eat without feeling guilty af, or I can't look other people eating because it disgusts me, and yet I can't stop eating.

753,az8cjw,looking for advice - accepting my ‘recovery body’,"a lot of the development of my eating disorder came from a fear of taking up too much space. at my worst i was severely underweight, but i’ve got to a point in recovery where i’m now a healthy, if not higher, weight for my size. it’s been about 4 months since i fully committed myself to getting better. i’ve been honouring cravings and quite literally just eating anything and everything, feeling like a ‘normal’ person for once.

it’s better, but i just cannot shake the negatives. i cannot stand how i look now. none of my clothes fit, i feel round and ugly and just so undesirable.
i’ve been telling myself that this will stop, eventually, and my weight will level out, but it’s been months and i’m still consistently gaining. i feel myself slipping back into behaviours ( subconsciously counting calories throughout my day ) and although i haven’t been losing weight i certainly want to at times. 

can someone please tell me, will this ever end? i hate the person i’ve become, at least physically. if i continue to eat whatever i like i feel as though i’ll never stop getting bigger. i’m terrified of the future and worried i’ll never be alright again. i wish i could just go back to the time ‘before’ all of this started. 

have you been here? how did you cope with this stage? will this just be my life forever now? do you have any suggestions on how to feel ‘beautiful’? anything at all. 

thank you so much if you read this far, i really appreciate it, so so much. ",1552166978,3/9/2019 15:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/az8cjw/looking_for_advice_accepting_my_recovery_body/,8

And I was in line and I couldn’t get my Apple Pay to work and I had already stepped out of line 3 times to let other people go ahead (it was one of the express lanes) and I let a girl on her break go before me bc hello it was her lunch break and those are limited

And it was only like a minute that I was asking the girl how to use it (I know I should know bc I’m youngish but I don’t) and this old man starts raising his voice at me and telling me how I’m holding up the whole line and how rude I am and to think of people other than myself 

And I SNAPPED and started yelling at him about how he’s fine to wait a minute and he has all the other lines he can go to and I literally haven’t eaten for DAYS so he needs to chill out 

(I usually pay w card but my card was stolen recently and my bank got delayed sending a new one to me so I just have the card number for it)

And I turn back but now I’m too flustered to work on it so I’m like ok whatever let them go so I can figure it out 

And he’s still talking shit about me RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME

So I raise my voice back and say that maybe next time he should offer help to someone  instead of berate them (bc I had asked if anyone knew how to do Apple Pay)

And he was just like yea whatever thanks for the great advice 

So I finally get it figured out (it wasn’t working bc i had to take my old card out) and I go to pay and the lady tells me to just take it for free bc the guy was a dick and she feels bad and I’m like no I can’t bc I don’t want it to come out of your check and she says she has like a voucher they get sometimes for certain amounts and it’s fine and she’s like it seems like you really need it

i told my mother today that im getting worse and am afraid to eat or drink anything with calories (im almost 19 but i still live with her and she still makes all my medical decisions - she is also aware of how long it's been since ive eaten) and told her that i might need to go inpatient hospitalization at the psych hospital again before my physical health gets worse than it already is, and she told me that that's not how it works (my past psych hospitalizations have primarily been for life-or-death crises) and that i can't just go back inpatient. i dont know what to do at this point and im scared if i keep going on like this without intensive help it will become a life-or-death crisis.",1552081945,3/8/2019 15:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ayvu8a/im_at_the_worst_ive_ever_been_idk_what_to_do/,5

768,b3bt1g,Recovery Meltdown (Long Journal Entry),"Yesterday I hit 2 months in recovery. 
In the beginning it was easy (easier). My body was reacting somewhat okay. I had pains and nausea but I managed. 
After a month things went downhill. My body turned against me. 
Constipation and bloating because a daily nuisance. ED thoughts got louder and some days extreme hunger set in.
At the end of the first month the constipation got worse, extreme bloating and abdominal pain accompanied it, along with a large distended stomach. 
Edema. My face puffed up, along with my legs, feet and hands. My body started aching. I felt like I had water balloons tied to me. I was feeling so heavy. 
Today I had a really bad episode. I almost relapsed.
I was getting dressed for the day and decided I’d wear the jeans I was wearing the day prior, today they didn’t close. 
I had given away my scale to my mom to hide. 
I was in this crazy state. 
I needed to know the number. 
I pulled all my clothes from the closet. I broke hangers and ripped some shirts.
In despair I rummaged through her things. 
I NEED TO KNOW.
I found it and without thought I stepped on the scale eager to know the number.
The realization quickly set it. 
Over these 2 months I had/have gained 40 pounds. 
I started hyperventilating, crying historically until I passed out. 
My mother calmed me down. 
But the thoughts are stronger than ever now. 
With the stress my stomach ballooned ever more, and my edema got worse.
I’m walking around looking 6 months pregnant, with swollen feet and hands.
I feel so anxious, tired, nauseated, angry, hungry, sad and numb at the same time.
I’m in a dark place right now. 
It’s supposed to get better, but when?! 
I’m at a loss. 

Going from severely underweight, to almost 20 pounds higher than my before starving myself weight was a real eye opener. 
I can’t believe I did this to myself.

785,b2nb20,My mom doesn't care,"I told my mom about my unhealthy eating habits and my desperate desire to be able to eat normally again.
She just grunted and continued staring into her phone not even looking at me.

Even though I might be overreacting, I am kind of hurt by the absolute lack of interest of my mother in me and my well being.

788,b2i64s,Is it even possible to beat anorexia?,"I feel like I'm not able to win this battle, as if ana is a part of me no matter what my weight is.
I managed to stay in 20 bmi range for about a year. I have to admit that I felt better in certain ways. Not cold all the time, ability to focus, better skin, not obsessing over meals , just eating whatever I want.

But at the same time I stayed deeply unsatisfied with the physical part of me. I managed to stay healthy only coz I had no body size mirror in my room, did not go out, I did not see other women on daily bases. My coworker is a woman but I always avoided looking at her when we talked, and I managed to get by. I did not look up women online, did not watch TV. In order to avoid comparing. I only read books and played games, watched youtubers (Only male)

Then relapsing process started...It was very slow. Happened over the course of 6 months. I was gradually getting triggered by random things. 
Like male coworker being nasty when commenting on an obese woman. Saying stuff like she shouldn't wear leggings, or go out. I can't stand it when people are commenting weight of other people. Now I mentally blacklisted him. 
I got triggered when a family friend was having a fight with his wife and called her fat, she was skinnier than him. Surely weighted less than 60kg. Wasn't anywhere near being fat. Luckily I rarely see him as he lives in another country. 
I get triggered when people make comments on my body, saying I gained weight or look healthy.

Now I dropped to BMI 17 , and it doesn't seem like I'm about to stop. I got into old bad habits . Bought myself body size mirror, throwing food away, taking pics of food and counting calories. And other stuff I won't mention. 

Lower weight doesn't make me feel any better. My life revolves around food and weight. I no longer play games nor read, I tend to sleep very early. I feel my life wasting away. 

Is there hope out there?

790,b2giyt,im a failure,"recently, ive been eating like crap. ive struggled with anorexia and wishes to purge since september of last year. i lost about 40 lbs in 3 months, then put on 10 over christmas (yk how it is when family is around and you have no choice but to digest the food and then cry in bed later on), and then lost the same 10. i thought that was bad - not being able to starve myself because my family was around. 

i used to get asked if i was eating properly, i used to get told i was wasting away, i used to smile as i put safety pin after safety pin into the waistband of my jeans in a weird attempt to stop them from falling to my thighs.

but now, schools started, i left my boyfriend (a huge motivation when it came to losing weight, i wanted him to see no flaws in my and i took my fat as a flaw) and im so stressed. i cant help but eat and eat and eat and eat. i have no one to talk to about it. i deleted my calorie counter in the hopes that if i cant stop myself from eating like this, i can at least stop myself from counting it up and feeling guilty. but it doesnt work. its like fucking torture - if i starve ill sit in agony and embarrassment as my stomach rumbles. ill check my wrist, thumb to pinkie, over and over again. and then i finally fucking cave and eat. absolute junk. some people consider 1000 calories unhealthy. but im eating 2000+ calories and i fucking hate myself for it, i dont want to get better but i cant starve anymore.

793,b2e4g5,What’s wrong with me? [VERY LONG],"I’ve been struggling with my weight my whole life. I was overweight at the age of 5-10 with everyone around me reminding me of it. As A child I loved eating, it was my passion. But my parents would remind me of what I was. A failure and an oversized child. 

Middle school was terrible. I struggled with obesity for most of it, still having that reminder in the back of my mind that no one would love me or would be attracted to me if I was this way. It subconsciously started to build a bitterness towards my body I would discover in high school. 

I found sports in high school. I started dieting, trying new work out methods, and obsessed over it. I would run in school and at home. Bought a treadmill and abused the shit out of it. I became a vegetarian and would never let myself be full, and only eating the minimum to maintain my body on...... I lost 30 pounds in 2 weeks. I never vomited, I hated the feeling. But i thought about it. 

I went into recovery in senior year, and then started college.... and it’s happening all over again. College is keeping me from being able to control what goes into my body, only limited to quick meals that scream “weight gain”. I buy fruit, eggs, and water. I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches minimally. Sometimes I don’t really eat bc I prefer not to instead of eating the food at the school. I also stock up on granola bars, so the headaches aren’t as bad when the hunger strikes....... 

I have depression on top of it. My boyfriend and i are in a relationship that we know will be over soon, we’re trying to be happy. I had a plan and now im lost, and I’m scared. 

My parents are nagging me that I need to eat more, as well as my best friend and my boyfriend. But how can I when the only thing I want to do is avoid weight gain. Tonight I didn’t eat anything besides nuts, since I spent all day in a bus. When I got to my dorm, my headache and my nausea were killing me... so I ordered chipotle. Keep in mind that if I eat this i eat it with as many vegetables as I can. And always try to avoid eating tortillas. Carbs, fats, it drives me insane. I recovered because I was able to control my body’s intake, i was able to control the amount of calories and the amount of nutrients that went into my body. Now i feel like everything is out of control, that the only thing I want to do is control my eating and not eat at all. Everything that’s happening is happening too fast and all I want to do is relapse. It’s the only thing that I seem to be able to control",1552881947,3/17/2019 23:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/b2e4g5/whats_wrong_with_me_very_long/,3

Now I’m OBVIOUSLY gaining weight because I’m recovering and actually eating regularly and it makes me feel like SHIT. I think about how I feel disgusting and can’t fit into my clothes constantly so I DON’T FUCKING NEED YOU REMINDING ME OF IT.

796,b2akup,"I think my friend may suffer from an eating disorder. I want to help her recover, but I don't know how to.","[I put a trigger warning as a precaution]

So, lately I've noticed that my friend, who I'll call M for now, is having relationship problems with her weight, body image and food. M has never seemed to have any problems until our freashman year of highschool. We're currently in our sophmore year and it's only becoming much worse.

Everyday during our gym class M would exercise non-stop until the class period ended. M would walk out of the gym competely covered in sweat and nearly passing out from exaustion. I remember one day during gym class when M drank some water from the water fountain and told me that the water was causing her to gain weight as she was looking at herself.

Every mourning M walks around the lunch room and claims that it's ""her daily walk."" I never seen M eat any of her food during our lunch period. M will buy food from the lunch line but I'll never see her eat any of it. M will play on her smartphone to keep herself distracted from the temptations of actually eating the food that she just bought.
M once admitted to me, and other students, during our english class that she counts calories during every meal she plans out throughtout the day. M even admitted to me that she has lost so much weight to the point that she's currently underweight.

I want to help M get better but I don't know what to do to help her get better. There were times where I was so tempted to anonymously tip our school through their website about M possibly suffering from an eating disorder, but I didn't tip them. The only problem is, if I end up getting the school involved, it may make things much worse for M.

799,b235t7,Possible relapse. [M],"So. This is my first time on reddit, sorry if I break any rules on accident. I guess I'm just here to rant a bit. It's really nerve wracking. I've been recovering from anorexia for around four years now. I've gained a lot of weight in those four years, obviously, and being on medications has also caused unwanted weight gain. I've never had stretchmarks, but I now have those. I can't look at myself naked without gagging. I've started to pick up on old habits, downloaded apps I used to use when I was really struggling. I purge every once in a while. So I guess I'm not really ""recovered"" as I had hoped. My friends sister recently made a comment about me now being ""chubby"" and I had a breakdown over it. I know I've gained weight. I know its normal. I know that she's a bit younger and doesn't realize that I see weight gain as a threat. We haven't seen each other in months, so my weight gain is going to seem more drastic to her than it is for me. I know how to go about this in a logical manner, the healthy way. But I'm scared. I get pleasure from feeling hungry again, I've started denying myself meals, I rewarded myself for purging the other night. I'm mentally calculating calories in food again. I look at the nutrition facts and feel my stomach drop when it's more than a certain amount of calories. I know I'm digging myself into a bigger relapse. But I know that with that, I'm going to lose people again with the satisfaction of having the illness to lean on. I feel like everything is spiraling out of control. Like this is the only thing I have again. And again, logically I know it's not. I know I have friends, a relationship with someone I'm terrified of screwing up. But this is slowly grasping me by the fucking throat again and I'm terrified. I guess its good that I'm scared of relapsing. But I just don't have any way to stop it from happening and I don't know what to do. You can leave advice or whatever if you want, I just needed to get it out and I didn't want to tell a friend and scare them.

At first I thought it was for a customer but then she printed the ticket and it had “SIDE SALAD” and my number at the top. I love M, she’s like 70 years old and she tells me all the time that I’m her favourite, but like please, I just wanted a side salad. And I told her she had made a mistake with my order, and that it was just a side salad and she said “no I didn’t” and winked and me. So I guess she thought she was treating me because she cares but really she was just torturing me. I got pretty upset about the salad and threw it away when I thought she wasn’t looking but I’m pretty sure she saw it still full in the trash because she acted differently towards me the rest of the night.

811,b1s9n1,my roommate grabbed my stomach last night and said I was getting fat but then said he only said it because of how it's not true,"My roommate is a fucking insecure dick. To be fair, he doesn't really know about my (21, male) struggle with ana, I haven't really disclosed it with him, despite us being quite close otherwise, because I had a hunch he wouldn't really get it. He is a little overweight and has put in effort into losing weight in the past year or so, but I have had conversations with him about how I'm lucky that my problem is having to eat more, and how most people would rather that than have to eat less. That I am blessed because I have to eat more because I starved myself for so long. This was after I told him that I had just fainted in my bedroom because I hadn't eaten enough recently. I get it, this ED shit doesn't make sense to normal people because it defies normal logic, you're hungry? you eat it just makes sense because it is conducive to existence. But I hate that his insecurities end up attacking me, partly because it makes me want to relapse hard and partly because I remember thinking the exact same shit as him when I was overweight. 

Well, to get to the point--and sorry that I have taken so long to get here, so if anyone is still reading this rambling mess, thank you--last night he grabbed my stomach and said I had been getting fat or gaining weight and kind of shook my stomach fat. I said to him, please don't say things like that to me... and he said ""I know I'm sorry... It's just so not true and so the opposite of the truth because you're so skinny!""

But the fucking truth is that HE'S FUCKING RIGHT AND IT LITERALLY MAKES ME WANT TO DIE. I HAVE BEEN GAINING WEIGHT. I WAS IN A PHP FOR 2 MONTHS AND NOW IM OUT AND GOING NUTS EATING HORRIBLY. all eat now is candy and junkfood and pasta and I try not to think about it, just eat to my cravings because I have been telling myself at least I am eating, even if it isn't the best for me. But I haven't been weighing myself very often, and I have been in denial about the weight I have been gaining. I looked on the scale today and it read 159 pounds. I used to be 132 pounds. I can't believe I let myself get this fat again. I remember when I first started losing weight I told myself I wasn't going to mention anything about dieting or losing weight until someone else noticed it first. I read somewhere that telling someone about your goals can make you less likely to achieve them because you get a small dopamine kick from saying you're going to do something, even if you haven't done it yet. So If I said I was going to lose weight, it wasn't going to happen... Now that someone has noticed my weight gain... It feels so fucking real and traumatic. I really really want to start starving myself again. The worst part is that it will be super hard again because I have fucking hunger signals again.

It makes me happy and mad at the same time happy that I’m being called skinny but mad because I’m not! I’m not satisfied with my weight I want to lose like 30 more lbs and then maybe then I’ll be satisfied just maybe tho because when I was 170 back in October I told my school nurse I will be satisfied once I’m 160 then that 160 turned to 150 and I’m 150 currently but I WANT TO LOSE MORE what do I have? ,1552677715,3/15/2019 14:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/b1j0mk/what_do_i_have/,2

819,b1bad6,Stopped getting my period,"And I feel fucked up about it because instead of being worried and sad like a normal human being, I feel excited and triumphant 

I’ve been about 15 ibs underweight for awhile and have been consistently losing each week. I always get asked once a month or more in treatment by my nutritionist or NP if I’m still getting my period and ofc I’ve always had to answer yes. So part of me has always been like ‘whyyyy am I still getting my period if I’m “so unhealthy”’ and I felt almost sad that I still got it like I was a fake or a failure 

Anyway, my periods had become longer and longer but lighter each time over the past 6 months, until my last one a few months ago was almost 3 weeks! And now nothing since, which has actually been nice bc it means I haven’t been bloating like I normally do 

I have been “binging” a lot recently bc I’m titrating off a medication and starting a new one, even though I’m still at a caloric deficit, so I feel like that might make it start up again which makes me sad ): 

I want to say I hate being so fucked up but at the same time I don’t want to change which ofc I know is even more fucked up, so now I feel conflicted over not feeling conflicted!! 

Idk though I just feel excited that I’ve lost my period which was in the old DSM for ana requirements but still feel kind of like an awful person for feeling that way

832,b6dnn0,Am I anorexic?,"I have little experience with eating disorders in general, so pardon me if I've got it wrong or anything.

For my whole life, I've called myself ""fat and ugly"". I've heard that anorexia makes you think that, but I'm still not certain. However, today, everything changed. 

I've tried to lose weight before, and it kinda went well but I lost motivation because I'm still depressed.

But the thing that changed. I usually have a protein shake in the morning. Today? ""I kinda need to lose weight. Maybe I can just skip it for today.""

Then lunch came. I only ate two chicken nuggets, then I gave the rest to someone else. Need to lose a lot of weight, and eating doesn't help. 

Then for dinner, two more chicken nuggets and a very small plate of rice. As I ate it all, it felt like I could feel the weight gain, and how much I dreaded it. So after that, I tried to throw it up. Kinda worked, but not really.

I've tried to limit calories before. But this is going insane. Today it's started with 1000 calories or less, but my body just suddenly designed a whole rules thing that I will slowly eat less and less calories. 

I realized the change, but then it morphed into ""I'm just trying to lose weight! Nothing can be wrong."" and now we're back to me noticing a change.

I want to eat. But my body is telling me ""Don't, eating isn't good."" So I haven't been eating a whole lot. There's not really an appetite to eat either.

Every single thing about food matters now. Calories? Make sure it's not high. Fat? Same deal. 

This started today, and I'm worried it's getting worse. Could anybody please give me advice?

Thanks. If you need me to, I can give more information.",1553742280,3/27/2019 22:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/b6dnn0/am_i_anorexic/,6

I have always, and I mean always been an overweight kid, im currently on my way to highschool next year and im 5ft 2in, and a 116-120 pounds and i hate it. I hate it so much cause ever since i can remember ive gone to the doctors and been told i was medically obese. 
   My mother didnt make things better and my father struggled with similar issues growing up. My mom was the reason i started starving. 
    Then in 7th grade health we watched a video about a woman with Anorexia. The goal was to scare us from it. I on the other hand was angry, angry because i knew i was becoming that. Angry at my classmates for their comments. Angry at the world. 
    My friends have been trying to get me to eat for a long time and it got so bad they would sit me down and shame me at the lunch table to the point where i would walk off crying. My one friend is very supportive but i dont know how to get him to fully understand. 
     I have started eating more and more and i gained a couple pounds and im obessesing over it and i hate it so much. I hate it. I hate it. I really do. And i weigh myself after i eat, in the morning, and when i shower and i just wanna stop. I just wanna eat without wondering how many calories. I have been thinking about purging because i cant handle having a full stomach anymore. It makes me feel sick. I just wanna be small and empty

839,b64uut,"My psychiatrist told me I have anorexia. I don’t want to agree, although deep down I know it’s true...","First, I want to say I’m diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so I’m seeing my psychiatrist pretty often.
Last August I needed a med adjustment and my doc was shocked with how skinny I was. I weighed 88 pounds. He asked how much I weigh and I lied saying I weigh 99 lbs.
On my last med adjustment I was prescribed Seroquel which is known to cause weight gain.
Last month when I went back I told him I gained weight. He smiled and said “good”.
I gained 11 pounds.
2 days ago I went back to get a prescription and I told him I’m worried about gaining anymore weight.

He sat me down and told me I’m anorexic.
I denied. He then made a deal with me that I’ll get to 105 lbs. I fought with his idea, I told him I’m gonna starve myself and he then told he doesn’t want me to die. And explained what anorexia does to people.
I left his office telling him I accept his deal, but now I’m starving myself.

I know it’s bad, but I just can’t stand the idea that I will gain weight. I liked myself skinny, I do not want to get fat again.
3 years ago I weighed 136 lbs, and I lost 44 pounds just to become skinny. And I loved it, and I stuck to that for 2 years. Counting calories, deny myself food, always worried I’m gaining weight, constantly sitting on the scale to make sure my weight is as low as possible.
I know if I stop taking my antipsychotic my weight will go down. But that will wreck havoc in my life and I’ll probably get hospitalized because of it.

Deep down, I know he’s right.
But it’s so hard to fight this...

864,b55akd,I know I need to but I don’t want to,"sorry this is log !!!

A little backstory to add some knowledge:
I’ve been struggling since I was in grade school. I reread some of my journal from high school, and there was an entry about being 101lbs and having to skip meals and workout. I’ve been called too skinny, but we all know that there is never skinny enough. always want more.

Fast forward a few years to when I went to a residential treatment center in December of 2016 to help with that, among other troubles. I got out and stuck to a meal plan... but it was hard. Especially hard when numerous coworkers commented on how I’ve gained weight.  so I said fuck it, and got right back on the ED train. I started working out frequently and eating basically nothing.

unfortunately, I have chronic health issues, physical, not just mental. I could no longer work out. I had to have another heart surgery. I didn’t cancel my membership because I planned to be right back at it once I got approved for physical activity again.... but they didn’t fix the problem so my hiatus was prolonged yet.

I just want to be fit and skinny.

so I’m back to starving myself. lying about meals. drinking too much water. of course, the obsession is still there. I swear this disorder is your inner demon working it’s hardest to make you hate yourself.

but I’m in a relationship now. &amp; my girlfriend has an eating disorder too. I know they lie about meals and stuff too. if not by saying it, it shows. I am trying to eat... but I hate the feeling that comes with it. I want to starve. I do. I don’t want my thighs to touch. I want the numbers on the scale go down, and do my big smile at the sight.

we agreed to try. so I will try. but...

I know I need to get better, but I don’t know if I want to. I need to give it up, but I don’t know how. even if I did know how, I don’t think I could.

don’t know what i’m looking for ... maybe support or guidance?",1553482643,3/24/2019 21:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/b55akd/i_know_i_need_to_but_i_dont_want_to/,0

For example, one week I'll eat absolutely nothing but then on the weekend I'll eat an entire grocery store, so it will make me feel disgusting and I'll do the cycle all over again .

I stopped eating and my parents yelled at me for not eating at the restaurant. The nauseous feeling scared me so I started eating more and more.

I then went to the doctor for a yearly check up and they said I was overweight. This upsets me greatly and I am starting to track my calories and eat less.

I got the nauseous feeling again today when I went out to eat with me family again. I took a small bite of fish and about 10 fries. I had to stop because I was ready to puke.

I'm scared but I don't want to go see a therapist or tell my family so I was just going to ask here.

890,b3y9ix,Something that pisses me off.,"This is just going to be a quick rant: 

I have struggles with anorexia for years. I’ll get to an okay place, and then relapse. But that’s not what pisses me off. We watched a video about it during health class. What you heard throughout the room was:

“Why can’t they just eat?”

“They’re trying to make us feel bad for their decision” 

“She needs a burger”

“But he’s not even fat”

“He can’t be anorexic. He’s not underweight”

“Do they not like food?”

NEWS FLASH:
- We can’t “just eat”, it’s more mental than that 
- We like food, we don’t like our body
- We go through daily struggles on top of struggling with ourselves 
- We are normal people
- We have feelings
- Just because someone isn’t underweight DOES NOT mean that we aren’t anorexic. It means that we’re still struggling. 

I’m sorry for the rant. I just really needed to get that out. For those of you going through anorexia, I wish I could help. I wish I could take that pain away from you guys, because I understand that pain. But please don’t give up on yourself, you are absolutely beautiful the way you are, and I don’t have to see any of you to know that. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Remember that you aren’t alone❤️

EDIT: Thank you for the silver and to everyone who commented. I know for the people who don’t comment and read this it probably makes you feel less alone and I am so thankful for that. You are all gorgeous, handsome, beautiful inside and out characters who struggle and are still living with an ED, but that doesn’t define you. What you have, doesn’t define you.

Emilys mum is sort of manipulative and toxic (tells her if emily moves in with her grandma for a month to clear her head she would cut all contacts, put Emily in a different hospital before she started recovery where she was strapped to the bed and force fed and her mum only agreed to take her out if she agreed to the mums terms (no more vegan, hospitalization, cutting certain contacts)).

Anyway, am I doing enough? I feel like I should do more for her...Are there specific things to help with anorexia recovery?",1553177024,3/21/2019 9:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/b3qwhn/supporting_a_friend/,2

I was a stripper for a few years, and then the AN set in. I wanted to be smaller and smaller, I would abuse laxatives and not eat more than a protein bar a day... I finally broke myself from the habit, and then I got pregnant with my third child. The thoughts have been creeping in and overwhelming me. I make myself not eat for a day or two and then I eat and get sick. I only have gained maybe thirty pounds more than my pre pregnancy weight, but I can't stand it. I grew up being 70lbs until I was 17. I've never weighed more than 120lbs (besides during pregnancy) I struggled with pregorexia as well. I thought I had beat it all. And now that I'm at 160lbs I just want to die. I hate it. I'm gross and I keel looking at all my old pics and crying because I was perfect. Sorry for ranting I just don't know anymore.

907,b8v516,"""Come on, at least eat that""","Possible TW so I'm marking it anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

I came here a week-ish back asking if I was anorexic. I eventually came to the conclusion that ""yes and it's going to get serious if I don't act on it now""

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on eating a little bit more. But it's still becoming increasingly harder to eat.

&amp;#x200B;

I was at lunch, and I basically just give my food to those who want it. Nobody wanted the apple, and neither did I. I have a friend who doesn't understand shit about this and he started saying ""At least eat the apple.""

&amp;#x200B;

I rejected it, and he kept going. ""Then half of it.""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why he forces me like this, but I rejected it. I prefer to eat a LITTLE bit when nobody else is around.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have another friend who makes a lot of jokes (and I appreciate it sometimes, because jokes can help you cope with things), but sometimes I don't think he realizes that his jokes are sometimes triggering. One time he called me fat (intended joke), but obviously, that didn't sit too well. 

&amp;#x200B;

and a TL;DR: friend keeps attempting to force me to eat anything and a different friend makes (sometimes triggering) jokes.

914,b8b0vs,Need to gain weight but cant stomach the thought of food!,"Hey, havent posted to reddit in a long long time, I'm sorry if I break some etiquette, go easy on me haha,

Anyway,
Im a 19 year old male, I'm 6ft tall and I weigh 110lbs. My BMI is roughly 15.5. 

Every day I'm losing more and more weight, but I just cant stomach any food lately (past 2 months). I used to be a normal 140lbs but now I'm so small that I wont even be able to work this summer if I dont gain at least 20 lbs (I work as a flight instructor and the minimum weight to fly solo is 125ish, it's different for each plane but it can be so high as 150.) Solo flights are usually used for proficiency and self practice, an integral part of refreshing my training. I digress; whenever I think about food I feel completely stuffed, whenever I eat I feel heavy and groggy, like I've just physically and mentally exerted myself. In the past month I've lost 10lbs down from 120. 

At this rate I will never be able to work come end of May. 

Finances are a huge constraint. I need extremely cheap, calorie dense foods. I would say on average I consume around 800 calories a day, mainly derived from coffee, to combat my extreme fatigue. On a good day I'll get around 2000 calories (once a week or so, and usually from fast food bought by family) 

Lately I havent been able to stay awake for longer than 6-7 hours a day and I sleep roughly 10-12 hours a night. I have a very easy going workplace where I can really just show up when I want but lately I haven't been showing up at all because it is manual labor and I am far too physically tired. No pressure from the workplace yet however, as I am on a drop in sort of basis. 

As a final note; I vape. I suspect this may actually be a factor in my lack of appetite but I really dont have the fortitude to drop vaping right now, it's like the only stimulant that gets me out of bed in the morning. *I bought a huge bottle of juice and a bunch of coils months ago, so this is not cutting into my food budget*

I dont know if this is even the right subreddit to be honest, I have never considered myself a person with anorexia, but my entire family is worried for me and have suspected that it may be as such. I do not hate food, I just cannot stomach the thought of it. Ideally I would be on a drinkable supplement for a few weeks to let my stomach readjust but I really cant afford it at all.

I can’t do this. 
I’m with this person I want to spend the rest of my life with but here I am lying to him and sneaking around when he’s sleeping. Don’t get me wrong I love and I hate myself so much for this. 
When he goes to sleep it starts. First induce vomiting then exercise and then popping laxatives like candy. 
I can’t do this my eating disorder makes me so manipulative and secretive. Normally I tell him literally *everything* but this I just can’t because he will make it stop but not mentally just physically.
But no one will actually help me with it (neither physical or psychological) because even though I am shedding weight I am not underweight so I am being praised, congratulated on how good I look. Little do they know just how Ill I am. 
My kidneys are dying, my heart is getting weaker. But my doctor just thinks it’s past damage and doesn’t care because I’m not “sick enough” to need help I’m not as thin as I used to be. But at this rate I’m not far off it. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore it is all too much. I am so ashamed I let it reach this point but so ashamed by how fat I am and I can’t take it anymore. Maybe I should just kill myself to make it better.

923,b7i2oe,"""Come Back to me""","Our group went out today to eat donuts at a ton of places as part of a tour essentially. Before this morning I didn't think much of it, I liked the idea of donuts and knew that these were good donut shops. For context, a few years ago I suffered from anorexia and have since gained back the weight plus a little (approx 10 extra pounds after my metabolism recovered). this morning I was getting ready to leave and I started to feel the fears creeping back to me from when I had the illness. it begged me to stay home, go back to starving, go back to how I was. to feel this coming back was mortifying, but with no other real option, I put on a mask and forced myself to go. we get to the first shop and the voice is talking again, more than ever

""You're making a mistake"" ""look at what this will do to you"" ""stop!"" ""you're breaking your rules"" ""come back to me, back to happiness""

I took a bite of donut and felt the pain of it again, pain of eating. I forced myself through it just so that I wouldn't have to experience it all again. it would get louder, tell me all the mistakes I was making, but eventually it subsided. around the 4th shop, it gave up, I was free again, but still in pain from what it had done to my brain. throughout the rest of the day that horrible thought lingered in my head:

""What if I went back? what's the worse that could happen?""

these thoughts are still running through my head occasionally, I'm starting to see myself as too big again, I feel like I'm about to fall back in.

I always tell her that I think she looks great right now, and that she looks better than some of the pictures of people with her goal weight do. However, it seems like this annoys or upsets her and I’m starting to doubt if I’m really doing actually is helping or if I’m just making things worse or making her dislike me.

Every Saturday night, unless my plans change, we will do a scribbl.io game. If you don't know what that is: it's a game where a group of people takes turn drawing words and the people not drawing have to guess the word. 

*Tomorrow's scribble game will be at 6pm EST.*

Once or twice a week, I want to do a ""theme"" day. This is just an experiment, but if people like it we'll do more. By themes, I mean ""dog day"", ""cat day"", ""motivation(the good kind) day"" etc... anything lighthearted. You'll post pictures, stories, etc.. 

I will always announce scribbl.io games in the casual convo subreddit chat room, so if you are interested in that I suggest joining that chat room. But for the riddles and theme days, I will probably make an announcement.

So I have been fighting w my providers like full out getting angry &amp; crying bc I’m so frustrated w everyone telling me my weight is too low and I need to gain weight and I’ll be like everyone is looking at my BMI!! But no one is looking at my body fat percentage which is so high!! I need to lose body fat blah blah blah 

In my head, I am like *at least* 35% to 50% body fat. That’s what I see when I look in the mirror or feel different parts of my body. I just imagine myself FILLED w all those nasty pics of fat that are all yellow and like gross and I just visually see it inside of me and I start freaking out. And then I freak out even more bc I feel like no matter how low my weight goes I still have so much body fat! 

Well. Flash forward to today. I was like you know what, this is enough, I’m just gonna get a fucking body scan so I know wth my real body fat percentage is. 

I’m sitting there waiting for the results bracing myself to be told I’m basically obese on the inside when the woman says you’re in the “essential fat” range and just hearing the word FAT used to describe a range I’m in, I’m like ‘omgomgomgomg I need to work out more I need to eat less’ etc etc and she’s like ‘essential fat is the minimum amount of fat you need to stay alive, so right now that means you don’t even have enough to get your period and you’re what we call “*under*fat” so you actually need to gain fat’ 

And I just sat there like ????????

945,b6mxg0,My experience with eating disorders,"  

Hello people, I'm a psychiatrist from Brazil and I want to share some of my experience with ED patients. This is not supposed to be looked at as medical advice, I'm just sharing some points that I think can help some people around here. Sorry for english mistakes if they happen. 

   
 

Family

\- The first thing I do when I diagnose someone with eating disorder is evaluating this person's relationship with family. And, if the patient wants, I talk to the family (or people that live with them) and I highly encourage them to learn about the disorder as much as they can. Very often the family have very low level of information about the disorder and end up doing a lot of harmful things while interacting with the patient. 

\- It's very often that I notice the family members themselves have an anxiety disorder or some other mental disorder. It would be ideal that they were under treatment when that is the case. Of course I don't tell them directly they have to look for treatment or else they get very defensive (and they are right, they didn't ask me to diagnose them)

Medication

\- The medications we currently use the most for eating disorders are antidepressants and antipsychotics.

\- We seek to treat the comorbidities at the same time, that plays a big role in what drug we choose to use.

\- Some psychiatrists choose medications that notably have weight gain as side effects, I am strongly against it because it will make it less likely that the patient will use it and recovery is not about gaining weight.

\- Using stimulants is one of the worse things a person with ED may do to themselves – it makes the disease worse and it also creates another problem to be solved. It is abusing substances that cause addiction and can be just as bad as abusing illegal drugs.

Comorbidities

\- Other common diagnoses in people with ED are borderline personality disorder, major depression, bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, OCD and anxiety disorders in general.

\- Only a psychiatrist will be able to make those diagnosis, and they are very common, so it’s very importante to seek professional help.

\- Everything must be treated together, or else one thing will make the other worse.

Psychological therapy

\- I have had patients with great results with cognitive behavioral therapy (I don’t do it myself), I don’t have experience with other forms of therapy.

\- I believe that for the eating disorder, it is more important than the medication, however the medication can help a lot and can help treating comorbidities.

Hospitalization

\- I see it as absolute last resort.

\- During the hospitalization, I still highly prefer that the patient gets the calories by eating.

\- It is very hard to have the patient feel that we are their ally, and not enemy. They are usually very hostile to us (it’s understandable, the hospitalization is usually against their will)

\- The primary goal of the hospitalization is not full recovery, obviously. It’s just a measure so the person won’t die of starvation.

Gaining weight x Recovering

\- Weight gain is a consequence of the recovery proccess, it’s not recovery itself.

\- Eating disorders are mental diseases. It is much more importante to me that a patient tells me “I am feeling better about myself in the last weeks” than “I’ve gained a few pounds”.

My experience with this subreddit

\- I’ve noticed that every user that I interacted with is from the United States.

\- I’ve noticed that a common problem is the financial aspect of the treatment: Family won’t pay professional help, Family won’t pay for the medications (in cases that the person doesn’t work yet or can’t pay for themselves).

\- I don’t really understand how it is to buy medications on the United States, but people usually buy the original medication rather than it’s copies, which are usually as effective and much cheaper (here in Brazil, if we get prescribed Lexapro, Prozac we can buy other escitalopram and fluoxetine with the same prescription, I don’t understand how it works there)

\- I’ve seen debates about fasting x eating disorders. Fasting itself can be healthy, but not in the eating disorder context: a person who does intermitente fasting (the right way) for example, still eats a normal amount of calories over the time of a week. We must remember that the problem with Anorexia and other eating disorders is not only about the eating habits, but with the mental suffering that originates it.

\- In this subreddit I’ve seen many males suffering from eating disorders, something I very rarely see here (I think it’s more common in United States than it is in Brazil)

\- I usually do not comment on posts here because I feel that the posters usually want to hear from another people suffering from eating disorders.

I didn’t realize I had stopped eating until I found out I’d lost more than 15 lbs in a month just from not having an appetite.  I want help but don’t know where to look. I don’t have a ton of family support because of my moms health and my brother’s addiction issues. I live on my own and can’t justify buying groceries for myself.

I’m scared because I’m isolating because I know people won’t understand. I don’t know what to do.  

I feel hunger and I’m proud. I get too hungry and when I think of eating my mind just can’t imagine eating. It feels like failure. I feel trapped but I don’t want to leave because then I’m a failure.  I don’t know. I don’t know anyone in my life who understands.

951,bbu4bh,What do I do,"I’ve always had a chubbier looking face. Because of the fact that I have low cheekbones and a wide jaw structure. When I put on weight my face looks round and fat like a balloon. It was never supposed to go this far. Now I have a killer jawline. And my face is slimmer than ever, you can see the places where my cheekbones are but because they’re low my face still has that slight chubby looking thing to it but not that bad. I never thought i would lose this much weight. In my head i knew it was anorexia but I was disguising it as being healthy. It got weird when validation turned into “stop losing weight” “what have you done to yourself!!” “God your jeans don’t even fit with a belt!”. I’m 5’8”. I thought I was 61kgs because I was avoiding the scales. Today I stepped on them. I’m actually 54kgs. And I know damn well it might go lower because habits have become habits. Last night for my boyfriend sake (he wants me to get better and is so supportive) I tried my hardest to eat. But my body literally can’t handle more than 300 calories a day now. It’s because in my head I want to see myself bony. I still see bits of fat in areas. I know I’ll go crazy trying to lose them.

959,bbh7zw,I had a breakdown at dinner the other night.,"I went to a sushi place with several friends from a previous job. 

I’m particularly comfortable with 1 of them (there were five. O, K, A, J, D) &amp; i’m kinda interested in A. but overall i’m on good terms with everyone.

This past year has been legitimately the best year of my life in terms of mental health (new med). Almost never feeling suicidal, eating more regularly, almost no anxiety. But these past few months everything is returning. 

So whenever i would thjnk about going to dinner i would get anxious &amp; feel nauseous. I though originally it was bc A was going to be there but i kept thinking about what i would eat when i was there. 

I would get so so anxious. I was considering what i wanted to eat &amp; what i thought was ok to eat. On my drive there i hadn’t yet determined what was ok to eat, and was feeling crazy anxious to the point where i thought i should not go. I sat in the parking lot for a few minutes FREAKING OUT. My hands were shaking, i felt nauseous &amp; i still wasn’t sure what was ok to eat.

I was debating leaving but really wanted to see my friends &amp; i was thinking maybe the anxiety would settle down once i actually sat down. 

I was anxious the whole time, tho partially due to sitting across for A (lol), i ordered water and a salmon roll, something which i typically consider to be ok.

(might i mentioned the only thing i had that day was 2 pieces of chex mix to “prepare” myself to eat)

The girls ordered sushi, &amp; the guys got other stuff so our food arrived first.

i was feeling horrifically anxious when my food arrived, i tried picking up my chopsticks but my hands were shaking so bad i had to put them down immediately. i was feeling so sick. 

eventually my friends started pointing out that i wasn’t eating, and i wasn’t prepared with an excuse as to why so i just said i was waiting..???? idk. but over the course of 2 hours i still wasn’t eating &amp; they kept asking &amp; asking if i was ok &amp; even the waitress asked if something was wrong.

i was freaking. the. fuck. out. 

i couldn’t even look at my food, i had to angle my body away. i felt so???? scared?? like the world was narrowing down on my &amp; i felt everyone was staring at me (they weren’t). 

i ended up taking the food home to my sister, and on the drive home i had a full blown panic attack. i couldn’t breathe &amp; was crying &amp; hating myself for being so fucking stupid to not even be able to eat on a DINNER DATE, and while i love my friends i just wish i never went.

3 of my friends texted me if i was ok afterwards (and i feel so stupid for being visibly upset enough for them to notice) but i told A i have anxiety eating around others, and i straight up told O i have an ED.

i feel so fucking stupid. now i can’t ever eat or not eat around them without them noticing.

also, side note: i went to panera with another friend &amp; wanted to look at the pastries because they’re pretty and he stRAIGHT IP FUCKING SAID “you’re so fat haha” when HE FUCKING KNOWS ABOUR MY ED.

too many people are aware of my food issues &amp; i want to die. but yea. i think i’m relapsing. 

no i know. because i already have a new diet planned out &amp; there is no winning. i wish i could go back in time 4 years to stop this from happening. aaaa.",1554866266,4/9/2019 22:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bbh7zw/i_had_a_breakdown_at_dinner_the_other_night/,1
960,bbfouq,I like skinny boys but am too scared to tell,"Hello Reddit,

First things first: I'm battling with anorexia and bullimia since I'm 14 or so. Always gaining and loosing weight again.

Since 2 years I'm in a relationship with my bf who is well built (in terms of healthy skinny, little bit muscular). But he often stated to me that he wants to build up muscle. I often said that I'm not really a fan of bulky guys. In fact I'm more a girl that likes really skinny guys. I don't know why tbh. 

I've never told him. I also never told him about my struggle with anorexia/bullimia. He just thinks that I try to stay healthy and loose some excess weight. He doesn't know I want to look like those models on tumblr. 

I think this is going to drown anyway but it would be kind to get some answers and your opinion about this topic. Thank you 😘",1554856800,4/9/2019 19:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bbfouq/i_like_skinny_boys_but_am_too_scared_to_tell/,2

963,baxs32,In recovery but I miss anorexia,"I had a (for lack of a better term) ana-buddy. we didn’t encourage each other’s eating disorder but we lived kind of close and we were the only people we could talk to. Around this time last year I kind of reached my breaking point and I wasn’t losing weight. She kind of broke as well and started recovery and we drifted apart. I really miss her. I don’t want a replacement, I just kind of miss that dynamic.

But now it’s been a year and I haven’t lost any weight. I’m actually up 10lbs. I’ve been trying to diet neurotypically but getting back into it is really triggering. I can’t help but feel good when I eat fewer than 1000kcal. I miss waking up early, sitting outside college on a cold dreary day with black coffee and a cigarette (i quit but i’ve been craving one too). I’ve been looking at thinspo again but i don’t think i’m going to fully relapse. Part of me wishes I would.

But I recently went on a medication that made me lose weight.  Surprisingly, losing weight didn’t send me into a relapse.  What almost set me back was trying to “bulk”.  Bulking normally means increasing the amount of calories you eat per day.  I loved my body with a bit of fat, so I wanted to gain back some fat. 
And I didn’t think this increasing calories would be a big issue because I wasn’t restricting myself to only eat a set amount of calories; I was planning to eat more calories.  

But when I started tracking my calories and writing down what I ate, I started to feel the same old obsession with food.   This almost made me relapse and I’m still really fighting myself to stay on track, but it’s been hard.  But I’m not gonna let this thing almost kill me again.

997,beeozr,"New here, feeling lost","I really don’t know where to go, so I though I would try here. Not really sure if anything triggering is here but I put it up just in case. (I’m sorry if I triggered you.)

I’m skinny by most standards. I’m 5’8”, 130 lbs. Sometimes my friends and family joke around about how skinny I am. I usually try to laugh it off, but most of the time I instantly think of my “problem areas” when that happens. I hate looking in mirrors because I instantly become obsessed with pointing out the things I hate.

But I still feel like I have so much weight on me. I can’t describe it except as a literal weight. My lowest weight was 114 lbs and I remember being happy for 1.03 seconds and then thought “Can I keep going?” That was also at the peak of my depression and anxiety. The anxiety is constant, and I think the depression is creeping back.

I know this is going to sound really fucked up. I feel like I have a problem, but no one will take it seriously because I don’t look “sick.” People see me eat, but I don’t think they see how little I eat, or make it look like I ate more than I did. My stomach will be making the loudest growling noises, and I chug water to try to get it to stop.

I intentionally don’t eat all day because if I don’t eat in front of my fiancé he’ll start asking questions. And I see it as a way to cut out calories (screwed up, right?) I have one meal a day. And I don’t graze throughout the day. I’ve gone 2 days without eating anything, multiple times. Mostly water, tea, or coffee. And a coke or Diet Coke. In my head, I’m just “watching my calories” and I can’t keep telling myself it’s normal anymore.

1005,be0w4q,I never thought it would get this bad,"I had an appointment with my doctor, only to be told that my organs are eating themselves, my muscles are deteriorating and my bones are so weak that I could break them from a minor fall. All because I don’t eat or drink more than once a day, and haven’t done for a long time. 

For those of you who didn’t know, I’ve been on an up and down battle with anorexia for a while, and I usually win against it, but recently I’ve become so sucked into the mindset of calories being deadly that it’s going to cost me my life... and for some reason I’d rather die than gain weight... If sounds awful now that I say it... 

In my mind, chub and fat looks amazing on everyone who isn’t me. I can’t stand gaining so much as a pound, and if I gain the slightest amount I will work my ass off to lose it again. I count every calorie down to the decimal points, I don’t eat more than 500 calories a day, and I only drink when my throat is aching from being so dry. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve been told that if I don’t start to attempt recovery, I will die... I should be in hospital but due to certain circumstances, I can’t go. My organs are failing and it’s all my fault, I’m going to die at 16 and I don’t have the willpower to stop myself from starving... I lost 3st in the space of 4 weeks and I’m dropping weight rapidly. XXS clothes are becoming baggy on me and it’s scaring me... I can’t stand for more than 30 seconds on my own without collapsing, my joints are in constant agony, and I’m on countless meds to keep me alive... 

PLEASE DO NOT LET IT GET TO THIS STAGE!!! I was stupid and never thought I would get this bad.

I've been struggling with restriction, exercise, and binging/purging for nearly a year now, although my bloodwork looks pretty normal and my BMI is only slightly lower than it should be. 

My dad straight up said he doesn't think I have a problem at all based on how I eat at his house, but I don't know if that's because he doesn't know how many calories are in the things I eat or doesn't know when I'm b/p-ing or if I really don't have a problem. 

Am I faking all of this?? I know that the bulimic tendencies felt suffocating and they were really bad for a while but if my labs are okay then was it really ever that bad? I restrict to under 600 calories a day but sometimes b/p, maybe around once a week...still, if I'm not skinny and my labs are fine and my dad doesn't see any problem, then will they feel the same at the clinic?
I worry they'll say I'm faking it or that I don't have and ED. I think I worry more that if I go they'll make me eat a crazy amount of calories even though my Basal Metabolic Rate is only around 1300... 

What the hell do I do? Tell the truth and risk being invalidated or forced to recover or lie and never get help? Is my dad right- is this all in my head???",1555452729,4/16/2019 17:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bdzyhy/going_to_a_clinic_when_not_sick_enough/,2

When I came downstairs on Saturday morning still in my pajamas (a tight black top and pajama pants) my parents suddenly stopped talking, I didn’t know why. Soon they resumed conversation. I went back upstairs briefly to grab something and while I was gone they started whispering. I could hear them murmuring abt my weight and that I looked a lot thinner than when they had last seen me. Later I asked my mom what she had been whispering abt when I had left the room. She told me that in the 3 weeks since she had last seen me I had become skeletal and that she was concerned. For context I’ve been struggling with my eating since I was 12 and was diagnosed with anorexia by a doctor at abt 13. Ever since then I’ve been “in recovery” except it feels like there is no such thing as recovery, I always have the same mindset, just some days I can ignore it better to eat “properly”. I’ve settled into a weird pattern of eating in these past years since I was diagnosed. I couldn’t actively restrict in HS since my parents attempted to monitor my eating. Now I eat in attempt to maintain my weight as to not concern my family / be able to stay happy. I’m somewhere between 90 and 100 lbs (idk bc I don’t have access to a scale) and yet I still feel huge. I don’t understand how I can look skeletal to someone yet feel huge. I’m trying so hard to love myself and be better but I can’t bc I feel such guilt when I eat like normal ppl.",1555290624,4/14/2019 20:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bda3nc/my_first_post/,1

1024,bcun77,"For anorexics, a potentially helpful analogy between eating and a wood-burning train.","A helpful metaphor for eating is to think about an old fashioned wood-burning train. You load up all the wood into the engine car, which does indeed temporarily add weight to the train (akin to food in the belly). 

But the engineer throws the wood into the fire over the next twelve hours, and at the end, ALL of the wood is burned. All that mass is GONE, and it was used to give the train life, the energy to move somewhere. 

Many anorexics have this unshakable feeling that food is an evil goo that shouldn’t be part of their body. 

But, just like the train, ALL of the food gets burned so as to give you life and energy to do everything. It just gets burned via a trillion micro-fires in every cell of your body rather than in a visible oven.",1555186064,4/13/2019 15:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bcun77/for_anorexics_a_potentially_helpful_analogy/,8

1052,bga287,My journey so far.,"My whole ordeal started probably back when I was in middle school (specifically 7th grade) when I didn’t really know what anorexia was. 
I mostly fasted, I saw myself as fat even though I was in the 90 lb area, I never made it to the 100’s till freshmen year of high school. 
Right now I’m a sophomore and a few months ago I realized what I was doing is wrong. I don’t plan on stopping. I now fast with understanding of what I’m doing. 
Today I caught myself bingeing, something I promised I wouldn’t ever do. 
The hardest thing for me to do so far is accepting that this whole thing is a problem. Right now I’m fluctuating from 96 lbs to 98 lbs. I still see my waist as fat. 
About a month ago I had a hallucinogenic experience due to dehydration, I let it brake me and lost the control I thought I had on my eating habits. 
Now I try to avoid food unless I’m eating with my family.
Only two of my friends know. One has sort of given up on me and the other is pushing for me to eat more. 
But it’s so hard. 

TLDR: I had a problem and I lost the control I used to have over my fasting periods and it’s getting worse.",1555981731,4/22/2019 20:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bga287/my_journey_so_far/,0

So for about two weeks I've slowly been reintroducing restricting and I've managed to get back down to 125lbs yet I feel SO MUCH fatter than I did at 136lbs. I look at my thighs and they look so much bigger and my gap is getting smaller every day yet I'm eating under 500kcal a day and continuing to lose?! I just don't know what to do anymore but every morning I look in the mirror and want to cry at how big I look now.

1057,bg1gsj,My clinic that helped me recover didn't really help :/,"I had really bad experience about 2 years ago. I was at my lowest weight at 92 lbs, and my mom made me go to an OUTPATIENT clinic because she was worried about my heart. I went there for like 6 months, and at the beginning, all they did was force feed me and make my parents force feed me. Not healthy foods either, like just eat regular but add sugar and butter. And although i understand they wanted to do this so i would gain some weight... it didn't really help me mentally. Each appointment i would come in, they feed me 2 packs of oreos and make me drink 2 ensures. They would measure my vitals and if I didn't gain enough weight they would scold me,tell me would i rather die than eat? (Side note: i  remember a male doctor seeing the cuts on my upper thigh and touching them without my permission, and it made me really uncomfortable..)They tried to pair up the sessions of checking my weight and basically force feeding me with seeing their on-site counselor, but she didn't really even talk to me about anything. The sessions were 30 mins long and she would just ask me about my boyfriend (at the time, now husband) and how's he been and what vacations are coming up, blah. Maybe this was her idea of helping, but it didn't... After i gained about 10 pounds, they gave me a graduation ceremony where they forced me to eat a Big Mac in front of my family. This is probably one of the worst memories i have ever. I try to block it out because I never felt so humiliated, and I had to act like i could do it just so I could graduate and not get force fed anymore.
I don't know if what they did is normal with other clinics, but my experience was just so bad. It probably is just their standard procedure so their patients don't die, but i feel like there's a better way than just eating butter loaded shit.

She said she's going to force me to eat or she will tell everybody in my family. I am just terrified of that. I tried to explain and she just didn't want to hear it, or just dismissed it completely.

For dessert. again. lmao by this point i was dying. so. i have a small thing of coffee ice cream, barely 1/4 a cup. my grandpa says oh no oh no no one is eating my ice cream and gets upset. so i take a tiny bit more of chocolate ice cream. he gets happy, and then gives me milk and cookies ice cream. it might have all amounted to maybe 1/2 a cup. oh yay. some more small Cadbury chocolate eggs, maybe 3 or 4. help i feel so fat lmao help me",1555895136,4/21/2019 20:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bfw214/chocolate_lots_of_sweets/,1

Some of my friends know, because I have confided in them, some people at my school have an idea but have never said anything regarding it. I slipped up and made a mistake (I do not wish to go into details) and since then my eating disorder has gotten even worse. I used to manage about 600 calories a day by constantly measuring out my food and caloric intake; however, I have noticed that it has gotten even worse. I’m barely hitting the mark for 300-400 calories. I’m too afraid to admit to my parents what is going on, and I had to isolate myself from nearly all of my friends because I feel as though I can’t trust them. I have nowhere to turn and I almost feel like I can’t eat. Every time I try to eat, I feel nauseous and get extremely nervous and lose whatever appetite I had previously.

My girlfriend has been on a “fitness” diet for about 6 months and lost a bunch of weight. I believe that the symptoms she is experiencing align with those from Anorexia.

She noticed a couple bits of hair coming out in the shower a week ago and it gave her a shock. She has since been motivated to reintroduce more carbohydrates, etc. into her diet, and is consuming about a 400 calorie surplus in effort to gain weight.

1110,bi9yfn,Anorexia is not an illness it’s a disease.,"I have struggled with anorexia for the last 3 years. My school knows but my friends don’t, I go through times where I start to feel more confident and happy about my body and then I crash back to counting every single calorie because I think I’ve gotten fat.

My worst time was 2 years ago, I spent most of the summer at home alone and I felt as if I had gotten significantly fatter during the holidays, I returned back to school having not spoken to any of my friends and they were all acting strange with me. I kept thinking “it’s because I’ve gotten fat” and I continued to lose weight.

My oldest friend who I used to run with noticed something was wrong and helped me see what I wasn’t seeing, my friends hadn’t changed I had. Since then I have had various times where I’ve obsessed about my weight and I often think of it as a disease, something that never completely goes away and will repeatedly need to be checked.

Recently I’ve been really good I’m comfortable with my body and am even able to eat school lunches now instead of controlling what I take, I told one of my closest friends from school and I’m going on 2 residential trips this summer.  But I always need to remember to keep positive and let people ask about my anorexia without overthinking.

Anyone want to share their story?",1556447796,4/28/2019 5:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bi9yfn/anorexia_is_not_an_illness_its_a_disease/,2
1111,bi9k6f,"just venting and if you get far enough into the wall of text, help?","Been four years since signs and habits of anorexia crept into my life, it was never life threatening, and I was pretty skinny naturally anyway. It was fueled by my boyfriend of the time, and also my bestfriend of the time. After the bestfriend and I stopped talking and then me and the boyfriend broke up, I found it 100% easier to eat and gained a bit of chub, but once I stopped indulging in everything I had refused to let myself eat, my weight simmered down to healthy and I had hips and boobs for the first time because there was actual fat on me. I and my family took term 4 off (2 terms after break up) and travelled around the country and the next year I started up at a new school. Since Christmas last year I have lost a lot of weight and my current boyfriend has mentioned it a few times (he’s aware of the history), and so have my other two best friends (who are nothing like the old one). I’m not doing it on purpose, and I’m obviously aware of it, should I see someone/be worried?

Actually fit. Taking photos so she can see herself. Cooking food she loves and praising her when she’s motivated to eat or ask for food. Her bras and clothes are starting to look like they don’t fit and are way too big. She said she hates the way she feels when she eats.  She’s 5’2” and weighs 99 pounds last weigh in.

The reason for this is because my brain goes ""they gonna see how fat I've become after high school"" ""don't torture their eyes with the sight of you."" 

The only friend I saw frequently after high school, I recently stopped hanging out with her because if she sees me waste away too much then she's going to tell my mom about my problems. (She reported me back in high school when I was suicidal) So basically I'm choosing my disorder, over my best friend.

1132,bm2etk,Drug Abuse for Weight Loss,"Hey everyone, I’m new to this corner of the ED internet, but I’ve been on ED tumblr/Insta/Twitter for years, and something I feel like no one really talks about is abusing drugs to kill your appetite so you’re not hungry. People talk about lax, weight loss pills, etc. a lot, but I don’t think I’ve ever run into anyone else who  (admittedly and consistently) takes stimulants to suppress appetite, increase energy, and help with the “brain fog” that so often comes with low restriction. I guess I just want to know if there’s anyone else out there who does this too? I’ve been taking Adderall for the better part of two years now off and on, but recently got a prescription after a computerized test to confirm that I do indeed have adult ADHD. Adderall started as something to help me pull all nighters and stay sharp during finals week, then slowly progressed to whenever I had a big test, and now it’s every day, because it really does help me focus and complete tasks. But I still take a higher dose than what I’m prescribed, and I usually just don’t eat when I take it because the thought of food disgusts me. I’ve been justifying it to myself thus far because it helps with school, and my anxiety and grades have both markedly improved, but I’ve lost quite a bit of weight in a short amount of time. I’m finally starting to let myself admit that the abuse, not the use, is probably down to my ED. I also went on a cocaine bender last year for about 6 months in combination with the Adderall, but I cut it off once it started to become problematic. And it SUCKED, because I gained a bunch of weight back once I started eating relatively normally again. I think part of the appeal also has to do with the control aspect of the disease, because I definitely feel more in control of myself, my life, and my own brain when I’m on stimulants, and that’s really hard for me to give up. I’ve been a lot better lately thanks to a new psychiatrist, new antidepressants (that actually work!), new anxiety medication, and weirdly enough because I did get a legitimate prescription for Adderall and now have to make sure it lasts the whole month instead of just buying more. Has anyone else done this, or is anyone else prescribed Adderall, and how do you keep yourself balanced and in a better mindset? I don’t want to lose the progress I’ve made, but it’s officially finals season and the stress is making me want to abuse it again so I don’t eat, which I know is actually detrimental to my health and my grades. Any tips, advice, or just commiserations appreciated!

P.S. I know the organization is really awful and I’m sorry, but this has all been pinging around in my brain for a while and I needed to get it out.",1557301486,5/8/2019 2:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bm2etk/drug_abuse_for_weight_loss/,2
1133,bm22ip,Girlfriend struggling with ED,"My amazing girlfriend and I have been together for almost 6 months. I love her so much, but I don’t love her eating disorder. It is a very sensitive topic in our relationship and it basically boils down to my girlfriend absolutely refusing to get any sort of help or talk to anyone about it. She sees a counselor for PTSD and depression, but she never mentions the eating disorder. I see how it clouds her judgement, and she even admitted to me that she isn’t ready to get better yet. How could someone not want to get better? Watching her struggle is the most heartbreaking scene, and any advice I offer is immediately shut down and dismissed, because she’s “been dealing with it longer than I have.” She always tells me that her recovery has to be on her time, not mine. But how can I trust her to actually seek recovery in the future if she is so adamantly in favor of waiting. Can’t she see how badly it hurts me? I want nothing more than for her to be happy and healthy, and I have a lot of trouble knowing how to react or respond. We recently had an argument where we agreed to not mention the ED at all because she refuses to seek help and I have done nothing but stress and strain myself trying to offer advice and help only to be met with being completely shut down. Eventually we will live together, and I feel that I may have to closely monitor what she eats. She tells me that I can’t control her, but I feel like that is the mental illness speaking through her. It doesn’t want to be contained, and she’s getting very resistant and easily agitated when we discuss ED related matters. I am very depressed and insecure and I will be undergoing therapy very soon for my mental health issues, and sometimes I feel like I can not handle both of our issues at once. I am constantly pushed a huge plate of complaints from her every day and I feel like I spend more time trying to comfort her because she’s sick than doing anything else. The other night we had a talk about my growing suicide thoughts, and she didn’t do a very good job of being sympathetic or even really listening. But I’m expected to sit and let my girlfriend tell me that it’s okay for her to lose X pounds because it would put her right at the margin for healthy and underweight, or that she’s going to make a cleansing detox drink that will make her throw up and help her lose weight; but I have to very very carefully watch my words because anything I say can make her break into a fit of tears because I said the wrong thing. I just don’t know how to handle her horrendous illness in addition to my own personal struggles. I love her more than anything, but I feel like I may not be able to handle it all much longer. I want to be happy with her, and I truly believe that it is out there for us one day, but I honestly feel that she is holding herself back and making things harder on herself. She tells me not to get so effected by her struggles, but that is a ridiculous thing to request of a very passionate and loving boyfriend. 

Any advice? Criticism? I would love to hear back on what I can expect to see when she is serious about recovery. Does she need inpatient therapy (which she refuses wholeheartedly even after expressing belief that it may help her.)?",1557298668,5/8/2019 1:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bm22ip/girlfriend_struggling_with_ed/,10

1141,blmgud,This month celebrates 3years eating food I love with people who care about me!,"(TW: Sexual Abuse, Anorexia)
I promise there’s a happy ending.

I was in a pretty bad abusive relationship, being physically abused and then told by both him and everyone around me that I should be thankful a guy was even putting up with me. 

First I ate salads and he praised me. I ate less and less and was praised for how much better and “healthier” I looked. I caved one night, Mac and cheese, my all time favorite. I was so hungry, so stressed, so starved for anything to make me feel happy I got up for a second portion at the college cafeteria. “Um, eat much?” He said. 

That was all it took. The delusion was confirmed. What I was eating was being monitored and this was a disgusting indulgence. 

I know it’s silly but for a desire to not trigger others you’ll have to trust me that the abuse went deeper. For example, he used to trace the outline of my belly and remark how strange it was that with all my extra weight none of it ever went to my chest, just my thighs. 

I barely ate anything for a year. I have no idea how much weight I lost but it was a contest with myself. It was a way to get praise when every day he told me how unlovable and monstrous I was. 

I got out of that “relationship”. I made new friends who helped me recognize the damage and rebuild the beautiful self I had before he came along. With time, help, honesty and openness about my struggles I am so pleased to report I have eaten two helpings of Mac and cheese guilt free! I still struggle with equating food and praise and my road is not fully traveled but I’m working hard and I wish you all the best in some day getting your second helping of Mac and cheese too! ;)",1557204245,5/6/2019 23:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/blmgud/this_month_celebrates_3years_eating_food_i_love/,1
1142,blm1sm,It’s either me or Ana,"At the beginning of this year, I was formally diagnosed with anorexia, restrictive type. Although I had been struggling with the disorder for a lot of my life. A year and a half ago, after my freshman year of college, I gained 30 pounds which pushed me over the edge to say the least. I started working out and eating better, but then it turned more into an obsession and I had categorized food as good or bad. Now things are to the point where people are worried about me because of all the weight I’ve lost. I’m at my lowest weight ever! For those who are curious, I’m 5’11” and 135lbs. I feel so tired all the time. Not just because of my lack of nutrition, but also because of the constant battle in my head against Ana. Every single time I’m hungry or it’s meal time, it’s a battle. Should I eat or not? Do I really need food or can I wait longer? When I do eat I typically feel like I’ve failed or betrayed the other voice in my head. This increases my anxiety and feelings of guilt. I also bruise soooo easily. Seems like every time I bump into something I create a new bruise. I just don’t know what to do anymore. Everything feels like a crazy mess in my head. And sometimes when people ask me questions idk the answers. I mean how am I suppose to explain something to you if I don’t even know/understand myself. My boyfriend is really concerned about my health. I’ve been considering inpatient, but I’m scared. I’ve never been inpatient before and the thought of having less control in an unfamiliar environment terrifies me. Idk what to do or what to think.

1143,blfcl5,Half of me wants to get help but the other half always stops me from doing it,"I’ve suffered with disordered eating my whole life, but recently it’s been hitting me harder than it ever did before. I was recovered, but I’ve relapsed harder than I have ever relapsed before. I reach out to people too, i talk to them and they tell me to go see a specialist. I want to. I’m 10 pounds underweight and I can tell I’m lacking so many vitamins . 

At the beginning, I was telling myself that I would get help if this was still happening in a week. Then when I reached out to the counseling center, and to the dietitian at my school, I avoided their emails and phone calls when they answered back. I found out there’s support groups and I told myself I needed to go, for my own good. But later would make an excuse and to this day haven’t shown up to one. The worst part is that even though I weigh myself and I know I’m underweight and not okay, I still look in the mirror and see flaws. I see myself being too thick, too flabby, I go to the gym everyday to make myself look better. I go because it helps me. The gym is how I cope. 

Today I had my first meal in about 2 weeks and didn’t even finish it. I ate half. Maybe. However, my body rejected so much food. I felt sick. And now I’m not planning on eating, cause i ate more and the feeling of being full makes me want to vomit. 

I feel like I have two different people inside my body. One who wants to get out to of this state, and the other who keeps me trapped. I hear her say “If you get help you’ll be fat like you used to be” and I believe her.

1153,bkryu3,Should I Stop Before I Develop an ED or Do I Already Have One?,"Hello, I just discovered this sub, and I have been engaging in restrictive eating for a couple of weeks, during which I learned a lot about my relationship with food. I have never had any problems with food in the past (besides the normal fluctuations of occasional overeating or undereating). When I started feeling pleased with myself when I had broken my fasting record and later developed a habit of feeling guilty after eating, I went to see a counselor. She didn't seem too worried when I explained my concerns, but she did schedule another appointment with me, which is coming up in a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of days later (Thursday), I was feeling confident in my ability to eat a normal amount based on my counselor's reaction, but after eating slightly more (\~1500cal) than my BMR (\~1400cal). I felt horrible about eating so much the previous day on Friday, so I did a low-calorie fast of \~200cal. Today, I ate \~500cal and felt like I had overeaten a bit. No guilt today, though, so I'm planning to maintain that amount until I speak to my counselor again. (Before appt, I had been eating \~1000cal/day.)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a slightly elevated BMI, and I keep saying to myself that I'm going to eat enough to maintain my weight after I lose enough lbs to have a normal BMI. After reading a lot of posts on here/other subs/MPA, I have realized that a lot of people on these forums start out with that mindset, and are never able to stop after they do reach their UGW.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I could probably go back to a normal diet fairly easily, so should I? Am I at risk?

1157,bkbm8o,Eating Disorder Recovery/ Delayed Puberty &amp; Height Growth! NEED SOME GUIDANCE!,"Hi all, I'm turning 25 in a few months and I have been suffering from on and off again anorexia since I was 17. I also started my menstruation and puberty EXTREMELY late (as my first period was induced with birth control as there was no sign of it starting at age 18) - my question is if I recovery fully now (with no relapse) will I grow any taller? Is that possible? 

A bit of the convoluted back story - As mentioned I started my period/ puberty extremely late. I didn't start my menstruation at 18 so the doctors put me on birth control. I got off of birth control at age 22 and started my first natural period at 23. I'm turning 25 and just recently have I started getting monthly periods (literally the past 4 months). However, during that entire time I've been going on and off of anorexia, and I'm going through recovery now and was curious about how it will affect my height. I've noticed small changes in my body over the past few years, and still am, all related to puberty, such as widening of my hips, hair on my upper lip, as well as a sex drive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anyone else out there who has experience both on and off again eating disorders or a delayed puberty THIS much and has experience height growth in mid twenties? Is that possible for a female? 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* I just want to make clear to everyone reading that the chance of height growth is not for me, nor should be the driving reason for anyone, to recover from an eating disorder.

1164,bp2gbw,Pretty girls don’t eat,"There is a lot to say about my own journey in Anorexia. A body dysmorphia that I obtained since childhood involved into an eating disorder around my teenage years. 


Tried many things; fasting for days in row, walking miles and miles under the hot dessert summer, freezing cold showers, thousands of crunches a day, drinking low cal tea until I pass out. 


Done many things and been to many places. There were days I would avoid mirrors and times I didn’t go shopping because I knew changing rooms are meant for mental breakdowns. 

6 years down the road, was only happy in my own skin when I loved and been loved for the first time. And when he was away I fell back into it. I fell back deep.

Nowadays, i’m lost in the cycle of relapse and recovery. Counting my days on packs of cigarettes and there is days that only thing I consume is alcohol. My body is not a temple. It’s dying with every hour. I don’t like what I see in the mirror and I don’t like anything. Binging and regretting and crying. that’s the new cycle I kinda obtained.

I’m now entering a very stressful 2 weeks in university. Everything is much harder when you do it with constant body dysmorphia thoughts in your head, a hungry stomach and headache caused by too much smoking. 


I’m tired knowing that I will never be enough for anything. I’m tired that my boyfriend has to love me like this and I can never be better for him. I’m tired and tired about thinking everything that involves my image. I wanna wear a skirt even though it makes me look absolutely huge. And I also wanna eat a fucking pizza before thinking how much calories in it.

I’m tired and in the middle of a mental breakdown. I know i’ll delete this post as soon as I get my mind in the right place again but I really needed to vent when I saw that sign saying “Pretty Girls Don’t Eat”...",1557949220,5/15/2019 14:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bp2gbw/pretty_girls_dont_eat/,0

I can't help but smile when I think about it or notice it when I look at myself in a mirror. However, I know I can't lose more weight. 

My bf (who's the only person that really notices how many meals I don't eat and how often) is growing more and more worried each time he visits or I visit him (we're long distance so we see each other every few weeks). 

I want to know what can I do to start eating better, or be more healthy at least. I try to eat more but I don't even feel hungry anymore, if I see too much food (which is often just a regular sized portion of it) then I get nauseous and also I rarely have appetite. I just never feel like eating, or it feels like too much work. 

I don't want to keep him so worried that he calls everyday because he's scared I'm not ok, I want to be honest and say yes when he asks me if I've eaten.

I didn't really expect much at first, thought maybe a few people would answer at most. I probably wouldn't be writing this if I didn't get the response that I did.


 I watched as they came through, and I never expected such a response. I read through every story and every hardship you listed. The points you guys gave me spurred deeper research rather than if I had not done the survey at all, and honestly I was shocked. After reading through everything and organizing it all, I have to say:


#You are all beautiful and I love you all. Thank you for opening up to me



The survey was for a school project, which I will be presenting within the next week. Someone said in the anything box that they hoped I would share my project with the subreddit. I would share my resources for this presentation with you guys but I don't want to breach confidentiality of anyone who participated as well as I don't want to be potentially identified if someone in my class is participating on this subreddit. if this was a personal project I probably would share it. To clarify, my professor does not have access to the survey and no identifiers were used when people were quoted.

1183,bo7v8z,People have a tendency of assuming having an eating disorder means you don’t eat,"People who know I have an eating disorder tend to ask me “hey how come you can eat normally?” “You still eat candy” “hey you’re eating”

My response? “It’s a work in progress” with a smile on my face that hurts because you know it’s not. You know you’re not getting better. And they reminded you of the pain. Still,’you stay silent.

I have days when I can forget i have a monster inside my head telling me to starve myself. I have good days. I have days where I live mostly in a calm state. Of course I’m still aware of this issue that I have, but in the back of my mind I know the fact that I can shove it in a little wooden box and ignore it for a moment means I have taken one more step towards recovery. 

Until someone reminds me of it. 

There’s two types of days in my life. One where I only eat fruit and low calorie bars to keep my body from going into starvation mode, but still starve it. And another, which doesn’t happen often, where I can listen to my brain and for a little bit I can be a normal person and go out sigh my friends to the movies without being paranoid of the calories a bag of popcorn has. I don’t drink soda, I don’t go out to restaurants. When I do, these days are very rare for me. 

So if you know someone who has an eating disorder and see them eating please! Don’t ask them about their eating habits. 

Cause every time someone asks me in a good day, it becomes a bad day. I get reminded of the macros I haven’t been counting, the calories I didn’t log and I didn’t count. I have panic attacks.

i’ve been trying to recover for ~7 months, but i still have those days where i can’t do it anymore. aNyWaY my friend noticed that i was falling back into some old habits so she told me i couldn’t keep doing this bc i was “almost anorexic” and she didn’t want me to hurt myself anymore.

i knOw she meant no harm but it was really upsetting??? eating disorders aren’t a competition but i was definitely underweight, had been diagnosed by my doctor + therapist, went to an ed clinic, got sent to inpatient aNd had a feeding tube shoved up my nose so idk what else i needed to be a “real” anorexic

I used to cut until I was forced to the hospital. Now I self harm by starving, smoking cigarettes, and depriving myself of things I enjoy (they are invisible habits to others which allows me to do it continuously). Recently I've been falling off my restrictive diet and the only way to force myself back on it is to be told that I'm in the wrong about something because that is a blow to my perfectionism which triggers my compulsions.

I posted on another subreddit asking if I was an asshole in a certain situation (I knew that I was) So that I could hear the negative reactions towards me which would rid me of any appetite. And it worked. I no longer want to eat, and I'm not mad about it.

I always want to lose weight, but i dont have the self control to stop myself from eating. 

The reason i said this would make people mad, is because, in short, i admire people with anorexia, and i know its wrong, but all my mind can think is “wow look at how much better they look than you, why cant you be like that, why dont you have the self control that they have?”

Ive read the stories of people’s personal experiences with anorexia, the ones that are meant to scare you off and make you say “oh my god thats terrible” but all they seem to do is inspire me. 

I know its wrong, but i cant stop myself from thinking this way, and ive been attempting to eat less unsuccessfully and everytime i fail i am ashamed and disgusted. The only reason i havent resorted to bulimia yet is because i saw some photos of the teeth of people that have it when i was younger, and decided against it. For some reason the idea of anorexia is still seen as something to be chased in my mind.

But I love to eat. Or at least I thought I did. 

I recently got an app, called my fitness pal. It let's you make a food diary. I get migraines a lot so I thought this would help me see if there were any food triggers. I put all my food in that I eat.

The app warned me that I'm not eating enough and in 5 weeks if I keep this up I'll be 83 pounds. I'm about 96 pounds now and I already feel really skinny.

I feel like I eat enough but then sometimes I feel really hungry to the point of being sick and no matter what I eat I'm still hungry. 

This happened a few years ago and my doctor told me to eat 2 bannanas a day because I was low in potassium. I eat a ton of food with potassium still to this day like bananas, avacados, dates, sun dried tomatoes.

I eat meat, veggies, fruits, dairy, everyday.

I don't get it, am I not eating enough portions??

1236,bpdrdu,Finally hit 100 lbs!!!,"I've been struggling with anorexia since I was 16. I was hospitalized when my weight was in the 80s, but honestly, nobody knew what to do with me. Twenty years later I found myself less than 90 lbs again. I looked awful and I felt awful. In February of this year, I made a promise to myself to gain weight and look good!! I drank naked high protein drinks, full fat yogurts, peanut butter, eggs, etc. I am now 100 lbs and love how I look and feel. Being 5'3, my healthy BMI states my weight should be 107 so I still have some weight to gain. But boy, do I feel soooo much better! I've been struggling with this disease more than half of my life. Thankfully I always knew how skinny I looked, I just didn't know how to ""fix"" it. There was no therapy, no meds to reach my goals. I just promised myself to eat a certain amount of calories each day (like 2500-3000.) Sometimes it's hard to do the opposite of what 90 percent of the population is doing (trying to lose weight,) but us skinny people need to be supported as well!

1237,bp9fqc,.,"I’ve actually been dealing with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa and had never told anyone yet. I usually wear baggy clothes so it looks like I’m a “normal weight” I just hate how this is taking over more and more whenever I wake up I think how much calories am I going to eat? Or should I not eat? What’s my weight today? I’m constantly thinking of food and my weight even at school so much that I can’t focus and even my grades are suffering. Even if I do eat I purge. Sometimes my cat will walk in and I just start crying. Then I just grab him and go back to my room. I also noticed that I grind my teeth but I don’t know if it has anything to do with it and the stomach acid is actually ruining my teeth but I developed bruxism. ( might have nothing to do with it I don’t really know) but I’ve actually been bulimic for a few years now and I haven’t told anyone then eventually developed anorexic tendencies. I just don’t know what to do anymore, it’s always cold even while it’s 80 degrees outside, I feel gross while wearing baggy clothes because it feels as if I’m wearing nothing over myself.

1239,bufi12,Any parents? Relapse..,"First post so bare with me. 

So I’ve suffered with eating disorders since I was around 12, My lowest weight was a couple of years ago, I looked terrible to people around me but admittedly I felt great. 
I started to get better last year/the year before due to losing about 40% of my hair (Why that doesn’t put me off I have no idea) and as soon as I started to recover, I got pregnant. 

As you can imagine I put on a substantial amount of weight while I was pregnant with my son who was born last month, I felt terrible regarding my body image but I had to to what I had to do, I intended to breastfeed which would require me to keep up a substantial diet, but it turns out I couldn’t.. ever since I’ve had to bottle feed him my first thought was “I can eat how I like now” and I’ve been restricting again ever since. 
I feel so stupid and selfish but it’s like I can’t help myself, I adore my son but I feel like the pregnancy weight has made me feel the lowest I’ve ever felt with my confidence. 

It seems really messed up but I’m not fully fasting because I’m scared of fainting while I’m looking after him, but I’m restricting just enough to function. 

Has anyone here had a baby before fully recovering?",1559140883,5/29/2019 9:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bufi12/any_parents_relapse/,3

Some background: about three years ago I decided to get help because I was going through some severe anorexia. I was in residential for almost a year and outpatient for about a year so basically I've been out of treatment for a little over a year. 

I'm really scared because like I said I didn't even realise I was doing it until my friend pointed out that he hadn't seen me eat in a couple of days. And so I weighed myself and have lost several pounds. I'm not intentionally doing it I think it's just how I am coping with the traumatic event. It's like I didn't even feel upset about the event but obviously some part of me did subconsciously because well here I am O.o I'm just really scared I've already been through treatment and it helped a little but really only because I was there every day and people were making me eat. I mean I definitely improved because even though I was still underweight I hadn't been enough to where it was serious if that makes sense but because I have lost this weight it is serious now. I guess I'm just kind of scared right now because I don't really know what to do except go back into treatment but I'm not sure if that would even help considering I didn't even realise I was doing it.

I already knew before she said cause her body has changed dramatically. She's nearly 6ft , I'm 5 ft 5 yet she is wayyyy smaller than me. Her bones are starting to show so I'm supportive and I let her know I'm not pressuring her. She does eat but it's all celery and soup or 10 calorie jelly. She's going through cahms (therapy) but it seems she's just putting on a display for them cause she hates them which I totally understand.
I know there isn't rlly anything I can do and I know what NOT to say but idk is there any advice ppl can give?

How do I continue my weight loss without falling into an eating disorder? I am very proud of the fact last couple weeks I've lost 5 lbs a week. I want to continue this without passing out again. It was not fun to lose that energy and I even missed a day at the gym.

I just want to be an average weight fast but my health isn't something to risk for it. It's hard to bring myself to eat now though. I don't think I'm anorexic, I just don't want to become.

Hello everyone, I have been lurking in here for a while. After a reeeaally long battle against obesity (SW: 120 kgs), I managed to get to a healthy weight (I am around 55 kgs, my height is 165 cms)... By restricting and restricting.


Since I have been suffering with health issues (both physical and mental) and had some form of ED when I was in middle school, the doctors who follow my case noticed my eating behavior was bad (and I lost a lot of weight in a really short time, about 1 year), I was sent to an ED clinic and got diagnosed with Atypical Anorexia (I might argue that I am a ""fake"", but the doctors argue that ""they caught me before my conditions got critical"", as I am experiencing several health complications).


I have been taking several tests for a few weeks, mostly focusing on trauma and dysfunctional relationships (family, school, abusive ex...). I didn't really think about it so much at first, but recently I have been having recurring intrusive and horrible thoughts about them, and they are really triggering (as in ""people are better off without me"", if you catch my drift). I called my GP and asked her if I could get the next appointment with the clinic scheduled earlier, because they are becoming quite nasty. 


Has it ever happened to you? How did/do you distract yourself? Do these kinds of tests really mess with your memories that much?

I'm planning to join my works gym, which will help, and by no means do I want Ana taking the reigns again. Equally, I'm terrified of getting back into bad habits again.

1304,bwa6yw,I hope I did the right thing and hat somewhat of an impact,"I’ve been struggling with anorexia on and off since I was 12. I am now 21 and although I still don’t feel comfortable in my own body, I made a lot of progress and no longer let food take control over my life. It took a lot of time, therapy and acceptance for me to be where I am now but I guess I am better now. Looking back at my ED at its worst I kinda wish someone would have reached out to me and told me it will get better and that my self worth is not dependent on my weight. 
So I saw this girl in the train, looking frail and shaking. I freed up my seat for her and she thankfully accepted my offer. Of course I could not be certain but she did not look good. She was basically just skin and bones just like I used to be. I thought to myself on whether I should just tap her in the shoulder and tell her that I’ve been trough the same and that it will get better. But I didn’t want to weird her out or make false accusations and offend her. 
I had an entire internal struggle with myself on whether it would be crossing boundaries to talk to her about EDs. I always keep the business card of my psychiatric in the back of my phone case just in case i get an anxiety attack or need to change my appointments. She has helped me cope a lot and actually get better. As she was getting out, I gave her the card and just said “in case you want to talk to someone” she took it and smiled. There was no sign of taking offense or anger. I’m not a mind reader but hence I’ve been trough the same and wanted someone to reach out and care I could imagine what it felt like. This small act of showing concern from a stranger might have meant something to her. Maybe she was weirded out and I just didn’t get it. Everyone has their own ways of coping after all. But I genuinely hope I had somewhat of a positive impact on this girl.

1305,bw5e9a,I think my friend might have anorexia and need advice,"So I have this friend, who I know from last conversations either has diagnosed anxiety/depression or thinks she has anxiety and depression. I know it runs in her family but it’s always been discussed in a very casual manner, so while I know she has very poor mental health I’m unsure of the details.

She often doesn’t eat or eats very little for lunch, and as I am kinda the mom friend of the group i always sorta force my friends to eat, every though the school food is trash. I noticed she was actually eating today. Here’s the convo that follows

Me: [name] good job actually eating today, food better than usual? 
Friend: nah I’m just super hungry because I didn’t eat breakfast or dinner (looks a little shocked as if she realized she shouldn’t have said that in front of the mom friend I am)
Me: why not!!! Come on [name]! Take care of yourself! 
Friend: (reluctantly) well... I’m on a diet where i don’t eat breakfast or dinner and only eat a small lunch...”
Me: and why are you doing that
Freind: because I hate myself and I’m worthless and I don’t wanna waste food on someone as horrible as me, plus I’m fat (she is super skinny) and if I lose weight I’ll be worth more
Me: how long have you been doing this for
Friend: since about December

Me and another friend who both did research on  anorexia were really worried about her, but our school is messed up. They once called the police and got someone arrested (taken to a jail not the hospital) for threatening to cut himself. So we’re sure that we aren’t going to a counselor, but there’s one teacher we really trust and our current plan is to ask her for advice without giving away any names.

What should we do? We have a mentality unhealthy teenager who hates herself, thinks she’s fat when she’s really skinny, barely eats anything and hasn’t since December, her parents don’t know, and our school system sucks

I used to be chubby as a kid and have a memory of my mother and grandma pointing it out to me even though they deny it. Around 13 years old I started to skip lunches and not eat as much. I did this with a friend and once I reached my goal weight I wanted to continue but my friend stopped me.

I relapsed during my second year of high school, I was at my lowest weight and everyone around me started noticing. I also started dating my ex and for the first time really talked to someone about this. He since started to force me to eat and I was honestly kinda satisfied with the way I looked because I felt like someone loved me.

That all changed when we broke up. Since the break up I have times of over eating and hating myself afterwards and times of not eating. My confidence is really low right now. On one hand I feel so fat and on the other I feel really thin. I don't know how to explain it. It's like I'm embarassed because I feel like I am fat but when someone touches me and they touch my bone I'm embarassed as well.

The point of this is.. I don't really know if I'm anorexic or if this is just a result of low self esteem. I know this is not a normal behaviour but at the same time I don't feel extremely unhealthy.

I'm sorry if I offended anyone. I don't want to come off as pretentious, I take this topic very very seriously.. I'm new here and I don't have anyone to talk to about this.

1322,bvqbmw,Getting things off my chest,"When my mother found out she was pregnant with me she had lost two or three stone, she threw up almost everyday and wasn’t allowed to eat solid food. I never like food, at the age of 6 I would chew and spit out my food, by the age of 12 my mother had given up on force feeding and trying to trick me into drinking weight drinks, my weight was almost five stone and I would sleep for almost 20 hours, only waking up for school and then I would sleep again. My mother would wake me for food every other day because she knew that I would eat when I wanted, one small bowl of pasta and that it I haven’t gotten much better, an average adult meal is something I would spread through the day and at the age 20 (current age) I’ve never weight more than eight stone, my current and most stable weight is a little over 7 now to look at me you wouldn’t guess my weight. I’m five’four and have C cups. I look decently healthy. New doctor are surprised when they weigh me. I find it hard to swallow food mainly sticking to pastas and other soft foods, I like three food groups which change often, and when I’m trying to figure out what would be in my food rotation I tend not to eat, it’s how I’ve always been, binge eat two or three things for about three weeks and then up to a month of eating maybe half a bag of hoops or other Crisps. I know it’s not healthy that’s all I’ve been told throughout my life, I’ve had it explained to me as though my body was a boiler that was constantly running on low, I’ve had my doctors tell me that my stomach has started to eat itself after so many years of starving (think charity adverts where they show children with bloated stomachs) I’ve been told that I’m putting myself in risk of carrying a child but I’m not ready to get healthy the idea of eating in front of people is something I have panic attacks about, cancelling birthday invites to birthdays because I don’t want to be questioned or looked at for only having small bites, the idea of weight to me is so terrifying, I’m not ready to let off of my body, I don’t feel sick and I’m so used to the feeling of emptiness that it’s became a safety blanket",1559427377,6/1/2019 17:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bvqbmw/getting_things_off_my_chest/,9

1326,bvfgdc,Freaking out,"I have a doctors appointment tomorrow with my psychiatrist, and I am freaking out on how I am gonna handle it. They take my weight and record it every time, and right now I am at the lowest weight I’ve ever been. I’m not ready to get help, I am finally happy with who I am and how I look. I disguise my disorder as a healthy lifestyle, and most people just think I’m a health freak when in reality it’s more. I’m not ready for those conversations when your family confronts you and judges you. The thing is, my disorder was never fully diagnosed. I had a brief moment in high school where I was badly underweight, but I was never taken to a specialist. My psychiatrist told us it was my anxiety. And that it would go away. And it did, kind of. But now I'm almost 5 pounds under my minimum weight, and 10 under my normal weight. I don’t know how to avoid this appointment. I’m just not ready to face my family.

Update: I ended up seeking help cause my doctor noticed right away I was underweight so I wasn't gonna be able to hide it. RN my parents are seeking different programs in Houston and no I don't really have a say on my treatment, cause ultimately its not my decision cause my mom is dragging me to them. She pays for my treatment as well. Now living at my house is honestly so exhausting, not too bad but not great either. I'm still hesitant to talk to strangers about something I've kept to myself for years, and my mom doesn't understand that I can't go around exposing my issues with actual strangers. Like, I barely wanted to tell her. I'm gonna make the most of these treatments, however, my behavior hasn't changed even if people are helping me now.

1333,bv2hlf,Because where else to talk about this.,"This is the first time I've ever really have said this outloud. Yah I know it's in text. But its as far as I've gotten. I've had ED since I was probably 10ish (22yrs old now) To be honest I dont even know how to admit it or feel like it's okay to talk about. 
My cousin who I grew up with knows, my sister knows cause she is a physiologist, and my boyfriend idk if he gets it or not.

This is the longest episode I've had. I'm scared, because I trained myself not to have an addictive personality. (Addiction is common in my genetics)

I tried talking to my cousin, and she just says ""you gotta try something. Drink protein shakes do this do that"" it doesnt help. Telling me I need to drink something or what not makes me not want to do anything. This was in January 

I've gone so far to trying to get my hands to touch around my waist. I'm scared to look at my weight. I'm scared to admit that I'm anorexic, or the fact that I maybe have 300-500 calories a day if I'm good. Most of the time I go every other without eating or drinking any calories. 

I wanted to ask for help from my boyfriend tonight. I wanted to tell him I'm not eating, and if I do I usually throw it up. That I lie about eating lunch or breakfast or the reason why I dont eat supper with him usually isnt because I had such a late lunch. I started off with saying that I am worried about gaining weight. He started going into that my tummy has gotten a bit bigger, and that my legs are thinner. And that he wishes I had thicker thighs and a less unhealthy stomach.  
I just about broke down infront of him and I'm trying not to break down now writing this. I've done so much for my stomach to be flat and I feel like I failed. It turned into him getting quiet and then when I asked what was wrong he said a few things (not related to this page) and then said something about my body dysmorphia. 

I'm just so fucking lost on what to do. I went to someone that I felt safe talking to. Was ready to ask for help and now i feel lost and like i should've just kept to myself.

I'm sorry to complain i just needed to get this out of my system and i wasnt sure on where to go.",1559272841,5/30/2019 22:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bv2hlf/because_where_else_to_talk_about_this/,1

1356,byn72b,I have been spiraling again and all the praise for losing weight is not making it any better,"For a little context, I have a lot on my plate at this moment and i started spiraling again, I'm also overweight seeing as when i was on my medication i was getting better mentally but i was gaining weight rapidly. I gained over 40 pounds during the period of me taking my antidepressants and the comments people close to me kept making about gaining weight have stuck with me even after i was supposedly ""better"".

I have been dealing with a lot of stress (new city, university, my boyfriend of 3 years literally breaking up with me with the ""how can i love someone who doesn't love themselves"", dad dropping the bomb to me that he might have cancer) and i slipped back to my old ways of avoiding food until im literally too weak to walk basically and ive lost a lot of weight in the past 3 months.

Now usually the people surrounding another person who has rapidly lost weight start to feel concerned, right? Well not in my case.

You see the moment an overweight girl loses weight even if its too fast for it to be healthy all she gets are compliments...

Seeing how no one seemingly cares about me losing weight rapidly all I'm compelled to do is to basically raise the stakes and start eating even less because all of this praise is what ive always wanted, all these years of being made fun of for not being skinny like everyone else around me have seeped so deep into my mind that i cant stop myself even though i know its wrong.

I'm just so upset with the fact that in my country unless youre visibly skinny you cant be anorexic. Because deep down i want to be healthy but this whole situation makes me feel as if all my worth here is calculated based on how skinny i am.

My biggest problem rn is the addiction. At times i even like how i feel, dizzy n weak n chill. Check scale to motivate myself to not eat. Weight went down again, 58kg. 2nd day w/o eating, tea,  coffee n cigs n starting to fantazise about food.. Like peanut butter would b amazing rn.

Still scared of gettin fat.. Salt, sugar, carbs, fat, even water sometimes..And even the fact that i dont have to feel as hot as it’s summer now.

 At this point my body uses all it can get n probably tmrw i’ll b so malnourished n will feel extremely numb n uncomfortable that i’ve to eat if i don’t b4 that happens. I also now get way more atention sense im actually so ill which i love. So it’s way more than just weight gain. I know. 

Enzymes help lil w bloating n stuff when i eat.
But the fkn addiction n love n attention im gettin which i’ve nvr rlly felt that much. It just feels, amazing..

”And what if i purge even w having the enzymes making eating easier” fml.😒

At least im in therapy. Tho he doest specialize on eds, but it helps. Also looking to c a dr.

I’m in recovery for 5 months and of course l still support the shit out of her( her mom does her best too) but she’s just fading away. She’s literally a walking skeleton and I GET IT (I used to want to look like that), if you force feed her it will make things only worse. And I GET that you can’t “just eat” even if you want to. 
Just to clarify: she doesn’t like   “anorexic type of body”, she had lost weight to be in better shape cause she used to be a bit overweight so she doesn’t want to get thinner; she tells me that she’s really trying to recover and I’m 99% she’s doesn’t lie to me.

Ok so I thought i'd post this here since you people actually understand this topic. I lost a bit of weight recently from not snacking during the day (I used to eat crisps and chocolate all day) and I thought everything was chill/normal. Then my brother showed me a chart he'd made- he'd been counting my calories and telling me I needed to eat more. (I eat 3 meals a day). I went to the doctor after my mum insisted just to shut her up, expecting the doctor to tell her she was overreacting- but the doctor said I was underweight and that I needed to gain back what i'd lost. But before I lost it I had a chubby stomach and puffy arms... so I dont see why my doctor would be saying this. All of my friends are as slim if not skinnier than me and their parents havent said anything to them. My periods have stopped but theyve always been irregular anyways. Whats even more annoying is why are boys allowed to be stick thin and nobody bats and eye, but when girls are its suddenly an issue? I dont honestly dont know if this is a twisted mindset or not, I'm super confused right now and could really use some guidance. My mother even went as far to say I have Body Dysmorphia. I just see girls in my classes who are stick thin and deemed a normal weight and think its unfair that im being called anorexic, yet im bigger than them. Are my family overreacting or am I not thinking properly? I even think I could do with losing more weight personally, I still have a little flab on my belly that I cant stand (not that bellies are anything bad, I just personally dont like how mine looks on me). Now my brother keeps telling my mother behind my back that my face is getting hollow and my fingers are too thin (my sister even said my goddamn *feet* where too bony), but I swear to god I dont see it. I used to think those pictures with the skinny girl seeing a fat girl in the mirror was symbolic and not literal, yet this somehow is the literal definition of that?

And 93 pounds. Yep, you guessed it.

1410,c02csw,Help with relapse,"I’ve suffered with an eating disorder for as long as I can remember in some form or another. I’ve really tried growing from it since it’s rampant in my family. I’ve removed negativity from my life and attempted to be body positive. I encourage and support others but recently started speaking with a prospective love interest. 

This person runs ultra marathons and is obsessive about foods. They are much thinner than me, on top of it all. I told them I had a history of eating disorders and that I had to be careful. He tries but fails sometimes. He talks a lot about what foods are good and which are bad and what I should and shouldn’t eat and he never outright shamed me but since I’ve started becoming involved with him I’ve definitely relapsed. 
I’ve resorted to very stringent “clean” eating or restricting AND exercising more. I know that when I do these things I’m treading water. I know that when I’m angry because I didn’t go to the gym and then don’t eat, that it’s not healthy. I’m 30 years old and I thought I was better then this. 

I’m already dealing with repercussions from my youth (I’ve had teeth fall out, my throat was so severely scarred that I had an endoscopy done and woke up to the nurses discussing it, which was mortifying as I have hid my EDs for the most of my life and only spoken with a couple therapists when I was having more suicidal ideation) BUT the problem is... you know that deep sinking feeling of how good it feels to be back with ED? It’s intoxicating. And it scares me. 

I really am starting to care for this person but I feel like he actually will find me disgusting if I’m naked in front of him and that he will eventually leave me for someone who is thinner and better. I feel so anxiously unworthy every time he looks at me. I’m worried he’s seeing everything wrong with me and that’s why he won’t commit. I feel like if I just lose weight, he’ll actually want me. He’s so smart and funny and cute that I know I can’t do better but also maybe I’m batting out of my league?

What do I do? Do I try to find someone else? I think no one is going to want me because I’m so gross but it’s been forever since I felt like this. And this isn’t his fault. I feel so angry with myself.",1560407511,6/13/2019 1:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/c02csw/help_with_relapse/,2
1411,c60tgi,"I’m so, so Scared of Recovery","I don’t know if this needs a trigger warning, I’m new to this sub and it’s lowkey a vent so I’m going to add one just in case. 

I’ve been dealing with this eating disorder since I was around 12 years old. I knew it was a problem right off the bat, though throughout the years I still haven’t told anyone about it. At first I thought it wasn’t real because it was on and off constantly, but then I was diagnosed with DID, which makes a lot of sense because only one of my alters suffers from the disorder.

Today, I was having a conversation in the car with my mum. She has a coworker she’s known for a very long time, and she suffers from Anorexia as well. She’s tried to recover for years but now she’s to the point where she’s extremely overweight, binge eats when stressed, and then continues to suffer from the illness on a daily basis. I don’t want to be like that when I’m in my 40s. She’s even drove an eating disorder into her own daughter, and now I think she’s living through her. The second her severely underweight daughter gains even a little weight, she gets so pissed off and complains to her and my mother about it for HOURS. She’s like the real life ‘Ana’, for real.

I’m just so terrified to turn out like that. I would never be able to live with myself. I’m so scared of gaining weight the thought of it makes me nauseous. If I physically saw that I had gained weight I might have a nervous breakdown. I don’t know what to do and I feel so lost. No one knows about this secret of mine, and I’m so scared to speak up.",1561608620,6/26/2019 23:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/c60tgi/im_so_so_scared_of_recovery/,4
1412,c60gik,What is recovery like?,"I’m not ready to take the steps yet but I’m wondering what recovery was like for you? I’m in therapy but I don’t think my therapist understands. She praises the fact that I eat so “healthy” aka lots of fruit and veggies. She mentioned she wants to try cauliflower rice since I said I eat that a lot because of the low calories. I also am not completely honest with her which is something I’ve always struggled with in any kind of therapy. 

I just don’t know what recovery is even like? What is a treatment center like? Do they just constantly
 tell you to eat and until you do you’re forced to stay there? That sounds so fucking terrifying. 

I feel like I’m always going to be scared of eating and being so uncomfortable with my body even though I’m very underweight. I work in the food  industry, love food, love cooking, love finding new recipes to try out but I haven’t done so in so long and it makes me sad. This disorder has taken over and every day I’m consumed by it. A huge chunk of my day consists of counting calories, planning meals, weighing myself, wondering how much I’ll weight the next day if I restrict a certain amount. I feel like the only way it will stop is if I get to a point where i finally scare myself enough and I’m not there yet even though i should be.

I usually skip breakfast and lunch. I usually eat a small dinner. I have a nasty habit of sneaking bites of food when no one is home. Usually, after I'm done eating, I feel extremely guilty. I also have really bad anxiety and can't handle doing many things alone.

Today I had to take my grandma to her doctor's appointment. I decided I would eat lunch while I was waiting for her at a restaurant that I used to love, but haven't really gone to since I've been a kid as it tends to be out of the way (I just don't usually go by that town, I'm usually in the opposite direction).

I ate my ENTIRE lunch. A tbone steak as big as my plate. Two eggs. Hash browns. Toast. A glass of coffee and a glass of water. 

I didn't even feel guilty. I feel a little ""heavy"" but I know it's just because I'm feeling full. I'm just so insanely proud of myself. I'm a little anxious because I already had chicken marinating last night to make for dinner tonight and I know my boyfriend will make me eat at least a piece or two, but i think I can handle it!

1431,c4v0rk,"How do I deal with gaining weight and stretch marks TW: numbers, suicide, bad body image","I've had disordered eating for around 4 or 5 years, possibly triggered by my sisters eating disorder when we were 12 and sexual and emotional abuse. I'm currently at my highest weight of 131lbs after my medication I've been on for my insomnia has been making me hungry literally all the time. I'd eat nearly half a loaf of bread and multiple bowls of cereal stacked up high, in a day almost every day for the past 5 or 6 months. After Christmas I'd gained 5 or 6lbs from my lowest weight of around 110lbs but I started slowly losing it again by fasting as I was still in school but only managed to lose 4 or 5lbs before I couldn't go to school any longer.

Around February I was put on medical leave because of my depression until this September where I'll be starting college 3 days a week. Obviously during this time I've been sat at home doing nothing which has lead me to eat more and more and not fast as I wake up absolutely starving and it feels so disgusting.

Now I'm at 131lbs and I can see a difference in how I look and when I brought up how my medication has made me gain weight to my mum she said that she noticed by didnt want to bring it up. Now I feel like a fat slob and I've noticed a few stretch marks on my hips and I've never cried so much in my life. I'm a trans guy and being more curvy and fat and suddenly getting stretch marks makes me uncomfortable and hate myself tbh. I cant leave the house and its so depressing.

After my brother committed suicide i felt some relief from my depression in a way. I'd been suicidal for years but it kinda just went away I guess, or at least the urges to harm myself or try to end my life went away because I saw how it affected my family. But now I just want to die. I dont want to be a fat slob and feel so disgusting in my body.

I start college in September which will be all day for 3 days a week so I can fast all day then so I'll definitely lose some weight, and I've come off my medication and I've that I dont wake up fucking starving which is good. But I'm still at home all day every day and I really just want to be at college so I dont have time to eat and it seems like a century away and it's so upsetting. Sorry for ranting I'm just crying and hating myself so much right now and I dont have therapy for another week and I'm upset because my insomnia is so bad after coming off my medication and ugh.

In only a few weeks I lost a ton and it all came back. I hate myself so much. I haven’t been eating. I recovered, and I gained A TON of weight. Still healthy, but it was just so overwhelming I couldn’t handle it. At first I was only working out to get muscle- now I don’t even have the motivation and I’m eating a low calorie thing or two a day. I’m obsessed with the scale. I feel so utterly helpless. I feel terrible. I’m starting to see the weird things again that happen when you’re too small, and I know I am, but when I look in the mirror I can’t see it. I feel like a whale. Taking up space in itself feels detrimental to my happiness. I don’t want to have to deal with this again, but I have no choice, I’m just stuck here. I wanted to “just be fit” but my version of that will always be stick thin. My boyfriend hasn’t noticed, well he has, but he doesn’t seem concerned. “Oh, you’re fasting again? Haha!” For the 294738th time in a week, and he congratulates me heavily on every pound I lose. (I know he prefers me when I’m 40 or so pounds heavier though.) It’s confusing and kind of odd but I’m scared because everybody noticed, they just don’t really care. 

I feel like a skeleton. No matter what I do I’m never my version of “desirable” skinny. It’s too much. It isn’t shaped right. Etc. I don’t think it’ll ever be enough. I’m scared that I might die, I feel helpless, I feel stupid, I feel worthless, I feel heavy (I’m 116 lbs) and I know I’m not but when I grab myself all I feel is squishy fat. If not, it’s hard but I can still GRAB. Grab grab grab, it never ends, I feel like I am dying. I feel like my mind is torturing me. It controls me.

On top of it, my mom is extremely judgmental about it. She works with patients at a hospital and whenever she talks about ones with an ed, she makes fun of them. Says they’re stupid. She laughs at me and just tells me I’m being dramatic and fake and I’m so skinny she’d kill to look like me (so basically, just shut up, with the stare that can kill.) She used to tug on my jeans when they got too big and say nasty things. She’s overweight and I’m not, so she projects it all onto me if I say or do anything related to my weight. It’s like being called fat while like this, but somehow worse. “You don’t deserve to feel like this, look at you, stop, shut up, haha” basically.",1561386978,6/24/2019 9:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/c4oxje/i_relapsed_and_feel_awful/,3

1434,c4k58m,Advice desperately needed!,"Hi everyone, 

I’m need advice on how to help my girlfriend, who is developing what I think is a pretty serious eating disorder. I don’t know how to approach it and it is constantly weighing on me.

Just a bit about her. She has BPD and has suffered from some serious trauma, though this is the first time it has manifested this way. She started losing weight rapidly about two months ago and it took me a while to really catch on (cue stupid comments like ‘where did my favourite butt go?’). We have tried talking about it but it seems off limits and I don’t want to push. I also don’t want keep pushing food onto her at risk of adding bulimia because of it. It got to a point today where on top of not eating she doesn’t want milk in her coffee anymore.  She was very skinny to begin with and I think it’s getting dangerous.

I’m honestly looking for any bit of advice I can get. I know there’s no simple fix but at this point I’m scared of telling her she’s beautiful at risk of validating the weight loss in her mind.

1455,c3jqnj,Am I anorexic? What should I do?,"Hi, Kyo here. This is my first post on the sub. I've added a trigger flare, but I just want to let you know, I don't talk about how I do this, ('ex: I skip (insert meal) by...'), but I do mention my weight and BMI multiple times, I also mention the habits that I have that could be common with eating disorders. This may not be effective, but please don't read this if it'll trigger you. I've been looking for something that could answer my questions, but the more I look around, the more confused I get. I've done a lot of research on anorexia and still can't decide, but it would be great to get a different opinion, even if you don't know for sure.

This started in March, a bit before BMI was taken for school. Before I was overweight (5""3', 136 lbs), and I was just doing this to get a healthy BMI. I started skipping lunch, and lost about 6 pounds in 3-4 weeks. My BMI was healthy (24.7), but only barely. I still wanted to lose weight. I felt so fat, so... disgusting. Every time I snacked, even though it was mainly because I didn't want people to worry about me, I would purge when no one could hear me. I thought (well, still think) snacking makes me weak, and if I can show more self-control, I'll be stronger.

In May, I started to skip breakfast as well as lunch, and noticed more rapid weight loss. People started to notice, but I denied it. I knew if I let on that I was consciously losing weight, they would try to force me to eat more than they already try. They said I was thinner, skinner. I don't believe them. All I see is that fat stomach, my thighs expanding so much when I sit down. I'm now at a healthy weight for my age (13), 5'5"" and 116 pounds.

On good days, I eat less than 600 calories. I don't have much time to exercise, but when I do, I do whenever possible. On bad days, I can eat up to 1200, which makes me feel really bad. My appetite hasn't completely gone, even though it's been reduced a lot. I get tired so much easier, and even every day activities make me want to pass out. I've been counting calories, and I don't know if I can stop. 

I know this is unhealthy, but not sure if it's anorexic. I know I should stop, but I don't want to gain all of the weight back. Also, I never mentioned this, but I'm not ready to tell my parents yet. So anything that involves telling them I will consider, but I may not use it yet.

P.S. The weight I put was my weight as of a few days ago, so I don't know if it changed. I can't weigh myself every day since I don't have a scale of my own, I weigh myself in a family members' room, and they hardly ever leave for long enough.",1561168499,6/21/2019 20:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/c3jqnj/am_i_anorexic_what_should_i_do/,4

I’m obviously very thin. My BMI is 16:underweight. My friends and family have all noticed. My friends know exactly what’s going on. My parents just think it’s work stress or some GI issue like chrons since it runs in my family. They aren’t too concerned cuz I’m not around them so they don’t see what I eat.

That being said. When I look in the mirror I hate my body. I look fat when I see myself. I hate my stomach. I feel like I look pregnant. I wanna see more bones and ribs, and my back. It sounds gross but I feel my most comfortable self when I’m thin. I’m in control. I know I’m basically there but I went on a trip this past week so I ate way more than I normally do (more than double the cals I normally do 500 to 2000+) for like 4 ish days. I tried to restrict as much as I could but it didn’t work when I was at family functions. I came home and I gained 3lbs. I’m normally 86 (used to be 108) and now I’m 89!!! I look so different and I feel like blew all hard work I’ve been doing for like 3 months. I’m so sad now. I want to be at my ugw but I feel like that won’t stop there. The number will just keep getting lower if I’m not please with how I look (body dysmorphia). So how do I over come that? I feel like that would help start some form of recovery...but maybe not idk

When this first started, all I did was skip breakfast and slightly restrict my lunch and eat dinner normally. Now that summer has started, I’m home alone most of the time, and no one noticed my eating habits. Ever since summer started, I’ve skipped breakfast and lunch. I only eat dinner now. A week ago I went to a summer camp and I couldn’t get away with skipping meals, so I had to eat. It made me feel so guilty. I couldn’t purge either, because I didn’t have access to a bathroom until much later, and by then the guilt had gone. When I got home I weighed myself. I weighed 114 lbs. I was so disappointed in myself. Before I left for the trip I was at 108 lbs. I still want to lose more. As of right now, I’m at 109 lbs, and I’m trying to lose more. I do thirty sit-ups every morning and night. I take my dog on three very long walks every day. I also run up and down the stairs when I’m home alone. I also went to my friend’s house over the weekend and stayed for two nights. Her family doesn’t eat very healthily, but I had no choice but to eat it. I managed to purge without being noticed. I just feel so bad about myself and how fat I look. I was swimming in my friend’s pool and I just felt like I looked so fat in my swim suit.

God I fucking hate the way I look. I wish I could just drop it all off. I skip meals all the time I don’t have the guts to throw up a lot although I wish I did. I do sometimes though. 
Gum is helpful. I use it a lot to stop me from being hungry. 
The only person I’ve told about this is my best friend and he thinks it’s concerning. I really don’t think I’m that far in. I think I’m fine. He tells me all the time how little my legs look but I disagree. On the contrary I think they look really big. Especially my stomach thought. I think I have a really prominent muffin top. Of course, my friend denies all this, but he’s probably just being nice. 
I know I shouldn’t do this but I think it’s good for me. I just want to lose weight. This is the fastest way to do it

1508,c6btlm,Has anyone gone through this transition before and am I going down a rabbit hole?,"Not asking for a diagnosis, just wondering if anyone had a transition from eating healthy to, well, developing an ED a similar way.

I was a size 2-4 in the States but coming back to east Asia, I can't even fit into an XL and that made me feel really insecure. I recently began losing weight by eating less and it's been working, so I've been going from eating a little less everyday to aggressively starving. I lie about how little I eat like ""I snacked earlier"", ""had a big breakfast and still full"". I don't talk about it to anyone.

There's a voice telling myself about how this is bad but another voice is telling me that ""I'm not skinny enough/feel shitty enough for it to be a problem"". It's like constant fighting in my head. I get compliments more than concern and it makes me happy and want to starve more even though I know it's unhealthy. Then the ""I'm not skinny enough/feel shitty enough for it to be a problem"" voice comes out and it wins.

I went from being proud of eating really healthy to feeling terrified because I had protein powder, half a bagel and a handful of nuts in a 14 hour span. I felt like I was supposed to stop at protein powder but I felt too hungry. Being somewhat full makes me nauseous and being actually full makes me horrified. 

I keep telling myself that I'll stop when I hit a certain weight but that number I set is getting lower and lower. I'm scared I'll be addicted to starving, but that ""it's not THAT bad"" voice comes out again. 

I've never been like this before and I keep believing that I can just snap my fingers when I reach my ever-decreasing ""goal weight"" and poof all this behavior and feelings will be gone. I know this is bad but I can't completely stop already so I'm starting to be scared of not being able to stop at all when I do this more. 

Can anyone relate? I know it'll take a bit of time to come back and it works differently for everyone, but I don't even know how to slam the brakes.",1561673484,6/27/2019 17:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/c6btlm/has_anyone_gone_through_this_transition_before/,2

1514,cbmi7g,Is treatment my only hope ?,"Hi there , I'm a 21 year old 6'6 man  thats been suffering from an for the past year and a half and I'm really not sure what to do anymore. I moved across the country last year in the hopes of meeting new people, finding a new job , and being surrounded by a new environment, unfortunately I brought my an with me, and although it wasn't ""that bad"" at the time of moving here, it quickly picked up and threw me in a downwards spiral. Within a month of moving here I became unable to leave my own apartment or even socialize with my roommates (who I already knew before moving here) because I thought I was overweight and couldn't deal with the idea of anyone looking at me and inadvertently completely walled myself off from society .  I  got my own apartment 2 months later and have lived here since, but after moving out of my old place I slowly lost contact with the people I lived with and spent the next 4 months without seeing a single person I knew. In those months I wasn't able to find/look for work because I thought that I was so ugly and fat that as soon as I would leave the establishment after dropping off my resume the workers would mock me and talk amongst themselves about how I have no shot working there because of my appearance. So I had no job, no friends, and an eating disorder that was kicking my ass. I was able to find a job mid January this year through a friend from back home at a bar but had to end up quitting after two months because the work environment was filled with straight up disgusting  toxic masculinity, and because of my height and broad shoulders douchey men just assume that I'm a ""bro"" like them and treat me like one of them, which started to take an even bigger toll on me because I was suffering really badly from my an. Fast forward 4 months later to today I still have no friends really, no job, and can feel my an getting worse and worse, I haven't eaten in 2 days and spent 5 hours yesterday in my bathroom in pitch dark going in and out of my steaming hot bathtub trying to sweat out whatever weight  I could squeeze out of my body, and was too scared to open my bathroom door because its facing my kitchen and I didn't want to see the food I had available. I also ran into my old roommate today who knows about my an and lovingly told me I'd started to look like skin'n'bones. I now weigh  about 175-180 pounds and have lost about 70 or 80 pounds since moving here ( I weighed 290 when graduating highschool 3 years ago)  and I don't know what to do anymore, I see a therapist that I really like and have no problems talking about my an to her but at the same time talking about it doesn't really seem to do anything to stop it. I'm running out of hope right now and I'm scared of this taking over my life more than it already is, or even killing me, but at the same time am equally terrified of putting on any weight. There's a free government run mental health institute in my city that apparently has a good Eating Disorder program that I've been thinking about checking myself into but am also extremely hesitant to. For the people that have gone through treatment or have tried to, what have your experiences been like ??

1515,cbjvpj,Greetings from an overweight former anorexic!," I am 19 and a female. 

Shortly saying: I have depression, anxiety and anorexia nervosa. I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember but I never thought it was abnormal. In my third year of high school my depression got worse after some exams.

I was always overweight. In eight grade i weighed 103 kg. Thats alot. I started to look into weight loss and such. At first it was slow and my weight was dropping at a healthy rate for about a year. Then I wanted to lose more and more weight. I never thought I could be sick, I was a whale. Bullying did not help, that happened more in the elementary school and junior high. My weight loss became more rapid after I started running. In the Christmas of 2018 in one week I ran a total of 95 km. Sounds insane right? It was also nothing weird of me at the time. I also worked out at the gym. In the beginning of January 2019 I ended up hospitalized due to bradycardia (low pulse, lowest at 24 at night). After that I was moved to a psychiatric section and stayed there about a month and could come home. I am vegan and have been since I got home (not an annoying one though). I gained weight well and have not relapsed to old habits. I am 169 cm tall and weigh now around 74-77 kg. That is where my body likes to be, I have noticed thinking back. I dont have problems with my weight now, im relatively okay.

I have gained a lot of weight since january, where my lowest weight was around 42 kg. I was in the hospital at the time. Everyone in my family is overweight (even our cat but he is kinda old). I feel like no one would believe me if I told them I ran over 20 km a few times a week  AND went to the gym 3 days a week...... Looking back it feels unreal and insane to think that. Can anyone else relate to thinking back and thinking: ""no way in hell I worked out/ran that much..""? 

Just hoping someone can relate to this. Feel free to ask questions about anything! I'll gladly answer!",1562780772,7/10/2019 12:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cbjvpj/greetings_from_an_overweight_former_anorexic/,17

I've added an eighth rule-- don't ask for a diagnoses, or experiences with vitamins/drugs. Why was this added? Because I think we're all getting a bit tired of people asking if they're anorexic or not. Why can't you ask for others' experiences with drugs/vitamins? Because everyone's body is different. Things will affect us in different ways, and there is no way that we can tell you if xyz will be good for you to take or not. 

I have also added a 9th rule: don't tell users that they can DM you or contact you in any way besides on the subreddit or in the chatrooms. There are a *lot* of creeps in the ED community, and in order to keep them from praying on you, any posts/comments saying that they can DM you, they should DM you, etc., will be removed. 

I will also be moderating more strictly as we are a growing community. 

I'm not currently looking for more moderators. I will however be attempting to engage with the community more.

1527,caoxc0,How I developed anorexia,"Trigger warning ⚠️ 



My mum was very health conscious! She used to lock away treats, sugar, salt, alcohol and other unhealthy things. Treats were scheduled! No treats on weekdays and only a biscuit or a lolly on the weekends! Tv and computer time was limited to 2 hours a day and was used as a punishment. I was often forced to stay outside till dinner time. One Sunday my dad poured me a large bowl of cereal when I was about 8, as I was eating it she shouted at him saying I wouldn't fit through a door by the time I was 10. I was an athletic child and was a dancer and a competitive runner and I also did horse riding. 11 was when I stopped eating treats offered and if I ate them I had to run or cycle for hours to stay skinny (I was 3 stone when I was 10) family members complained I was too skinny but I loved hearing it.
At 15 I stopped eating breakfast and lunch. I used to crush cereal into a bowl and add some milk and leave it in the sink. I dumped my lunch and tried to eat dinner alone so I could dump anything I deemed too unhealthy or fattening. I fainted on a walk home from school and had very low iron! I gradually got a bit better but would never allow my weight to go above 7.5 stone! (I'm 5""6) I constantly relapsed and hit under 6 stone each time before making changes. I went into inpatient treatment at 18 where I was officially diagnosed with anorexia. I am now 22, 5""6 and just under 7 stone...I still won't allow myself to go above 7.5 and still hold the rules of no liquid calories, no cakes or biscuits or sweets in general, trim fat and press grease out of any food with a higher fat content, no food unless I've gone 15 hours without eating from the previous day, no butter in sandwiches, boiling chicken and veg and never adding oil, no eating off others plates, and I typically eat the same thing all the time because I know the calorie content and don't have to search, weigh and worry
I'm slowly trying to break these habits! Last week I had a sugary drink, didn't squeeze out the grease from some sausages, ate some crisps without weighing them, did not weigh myself. A few tears here and there but if I don't break the rules now then I never will and I will always be controlled by food.",1562610790,7/8/2019 13:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/caoxc0/how_i_developed_anorexia/,13

1529,cah6i4,I’m not the only one right?,"For me the myriad of eating disorders goes on through almost a decade so surely I’ve trashed my metabolism. I’ve been basically recovered ish for the past 8 months and in that time I gained back the 30 pounds I lost before when I was eating very little calories each day. Recently I’ve seen a personal trainer and a nutritionist and these past 2 months I’ve only lost 2 POUNDS. We did the body scan and I’m 47% body fat I’m scarily unhealthy and disgusting. And I am so so so so incredibly furious and frustrated... how is it that I’m finally doing everything the “right” way and it’s not working I’m still disgusting I’m still scared to wear fitting clothes and I’m scared to eat in front of others, really back to square one. 

My problem is that I just don’t know how else to drop weight that not eating. Everyone and everything says “calories in calories out” and it’s the only way I know how. I just feel like weight loss methods and diets and healthy living and this crap is so contradictory. Nothing makes sense, I don’t know what is too much what is too little. I don’t know if I’m fucked in the head or just being over dramatic. All I’ve ever known is taking it by the balls and going all out. If I’m going to be in a calorie deficit, make it the largest deficit possible. I don’t really have much else to say, I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this or felt this way before ... 

For me I’m deeply saddened because I really thought I recovered I really thought that I could go on living this normalish life. And I’m so fat my percentage is almost half my body and I feel so unhealthy I can’t help but justify anorexia as a part of my life because maybe it isn’t the worst thing for me",1562565086,7/8/2019 0:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cah6i4/im_not_the_only_one_right/,1

Hi everyone! My name is Maddie, and my sister has/had anorexia (idk if she has fully recovered or not, all I know is that she stopped tracking her food) anyways! I want some advice. So my sister has been dating this guy (I feel like I don’t really know this dude, idk it’s weird) and I’m not 100% certain this has anything to do with her ED, but I heard her crying to my mom and she said something along the lines of “he’s been noticing and idk how to tell him, I don’t really talk about this” do you girls/guys think that there’s anything that I could do to help her as a sister?

1559,c8z7dx,Losing weight- need to lose but afraid it’ll spiral out of control.,"I’ve had an eating disorder of one kind or another most of my life. It varied from over eating, bingeing and purging with laxatives, to restrictionist type eating, to ednos to over exercising to get rid of calories. 

My ex husband was an asshole who seriously triggered my ed. Both over eating at some points and then using lax to purge and then just not eating.  I can’t really say I ever had anorexia because my BMI just never quite got low enough. 

At the tail end of my divorce I was 5’8” and 110 lbs. this is what I was when I met my new husband. I slowly gained and stayed at 128 for several years which was healthy for me. But then I fell and hit my head resulting in a lot of alone time due to concussion and not being able to prepare food and a lot of boredom eating. Then we had several pregnancy losses and I began to stress eat.  By the time I got pregnant with our first child together I was 205 lbs. I was only about 5 lbs laughter when I got pregnant with my second but was so sick I lost ten lbs during the pregnancy. I’ve stayed less than 200 since then (almost two years). I know those numbers sound huge. It’s gross and I hated it. Every second. 

A few mi the ago my weight had creeped up from 170 to 180 again.  So I decided to lose weight. I’ve focused on lean proteins and veggies as a way to quicker loss. And it’s working. I’m down almost 20 lbs. clothes I bought two months ago are too big. Great!  Right?  

Except I’m worried I’ll go too far. I’d like to be around 130 in the end. I hope it’s possible to get there without starving myself. I hope I can do it without falling back into the spiral that is an Ed.  

So / does anyone have any advice on how to do that?  How do I get control over my weight without going too far and falling into that ever so familiar pit?  Or getting discouraged and falling back into over eating again?  Honestly I’d rather live with an active Ed the rest of my life than be fat for the rest of it!",1562221690,7/4/2019 1:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/c8z7dx/losing_weight_need_to_lose_but_afraid_itll_spiral/,2

I have a not so great cycle.  Try to restrict, over eat, contemplate purging far to late for it to do anything, and then wish I could literally just rip out the calories from my entire body.

The reason I *don’t* purge is because if you wait too long your body already has taken up x amount of calories.  And it doesn’t hit until an hour or two after.  So it won’t do anything for me anyways.

I’ve never truly purged either, so I don’t know why my brain hounds me on it.  Go away.

1564,ceg12d,I’m not sure what to do,"Ok. So this might be long 😩 

My mother was constantly criticizing my weight ... putting me on diets, fasts, laxatives... 

I developed an eating disorder at 13, and began a really horrific restricting/binging/purging cycle that turned into a 4 year battle with myself. I was hospitalized for self harm and my eating disorder at 17. I became extremely agoraphobic and dropped out of high school, and stopped leaving my house because of the fear of judgement regarding my weight. I couldn’t go on dates with my boyfriend (whom I eventually married! ❤️) I couldn’t walk during graduation, I couldn’t make or keep friends.... my eating disorder controlled my entire life. 

I did recover and honestly those were the best years of my life!! 

However my husband and I suffered a really traumatic pregnancy loss and I began to binge again. I binged and binged and binged and convinced myself that at least I was eating. 

I became so depressed I couldn’t get out of bed. Nothing helped. Nothing was fun. Nothing was ok. I wanted to die.... I was going to kill myself. 

I told my husband and he sprung into action and got me help. I am on anti anxiety medication and antidepressants now. 

I reached the embarrassingly high number of 283lbs during my depression. 

My medication made me lose my urge to binge .... and I think I am taking advantage of it... I have stopped eating breakfast and lunch. I have switched to low calorie vegan meals for dinner. I get panicked when I feel full and want to purge ... I weigh myself a minimum of 3 times a day. I have lost 20lbs in 2 1/2 weeks... I am scared of food again. 

I can’t find the happy balance between my losing weight for my health (because I need to desperately...) and it spiraling into an eating disorder again. 

I’m seeing my therapist again today and I might mention it... I’m not sure 😕",1563384849,7/17/2019 12:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ceg12d/im_not_sure_what_to_do/,2
1565,cefoeu,I want/need to share me ed story (TW I talk about how my bad behaviour was and how my thoughts were/are),"So all my life I kinda struggled with myself and my body. I always thought I wasn't good enough and fat. I can remember that always in the back of my head this voice kept saying, you need to work out eat health and lose weight. I tried a few times but I never really could do it so I gave up after a few weeks. But this time was different. 


Last November or so something inside me changed. I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't keep living like this ""fat"" person. So I started restricting. My mom always gave me 2 slices of bread to school and I threw them away. I only ate 1 apple and like 10 slices of cucumber during the whole school day (8.30 am - 4.00/5.00 pm) ,if I had a good day I ate a banana or some yoghurt before school, if I had a bad day I would eat less. I always ate dinner and sometimes even a small snack at night. I tried fasting for 12 or more hours (starting at night and trying to go on during the day). I felt terrible every day but I thought it was only for now and I would be happy as soon as I was beautiful. But it only got worse. My ribs were showing and I loved it (now that they barely show I miss it) but it wasn't healthy. 


I needed to change so I started telling my friends. They wanted me to get better so I tried. At first I couldn't so I pretended I was getting better. Then I want on a vacation and there was a lot of food and I had to eat with my parents 3 times a day for like 10 days. This is where my recovery really started. I ate everyday. At first I ate so much because I was starving but then I got sick of it. I wasn't feeling hungry anymore and I felt terrible. Being full sucked. I kept telling myself when I get home I can be empty again. But I couldn't. 



I started a new job in a kitchen. I have to eat there 2/3 times a week and if I don't eat they notice. So now 9 months later I'm healthy again. When I started my job I was on the edge of being underweight. Now I'm heavier than I was before all this started and I'm feeling physically better but mentally worse. Now that I know I'm the heaviest I have ever been I want to restrict again. I made a plan to start restricting again when schools starts. i'm slowly starting to work out again and I know if I'm not careful I fall back into that rabbit hole. I'm afraid, of my past, of my present and of my future. But I know if I keep holding on I will be ok. 



There is a reason I wrote my story down. I wrote this for the people on this site who are currently struggling and are afraid of themselves and recovery. I don't want to force anyone of course but being honest about your problem and trying to find a way to get better is worth it. Yes this will always be a part of my life, I always need to fight this but it will get easier.",1563383241,7/17/2019 12:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cefoeu/i_wantneed_to_share_me_ed_story_tw_i_talk_about/,3

Drinking too much water n coffee is definitely still a problem, just wanna drown n not feel hungry ever again. Especially in recovery cause it feels like im literally hungry 24/7...not ok eating all the time.🥑🤗💪🏼😳🤮😭

”Why did u eat again u fatty”

Relapsing has been  on my mind more and more again. Almost reaching the same weight [67kg] now when i last fell back to my old habbits. Mom got cancer too then which is now gettin better but feel like could still relapse due to all the h8 towards my body rn ew.

My boss was rightfully pissed at me, and I might get fired. I feel as if I don’t deserve food, and I can’t eat because I have ruined someone else’s day, possibly the whole store. I was also working alone, so I had no one to talk to who could verify if it was real. I have been doing good lately with eating enough and not restricting, but this brought it back full force. I feel like I am a stupid, worthless human being who can’t even do a simple minimum wage job right.

I ended up drinking 3 espresso's and a double espresso.
The waiter gave me a croissant for free and I gave it back, together with the milk and sugar for the coffee.

My classmates finally arrived, and afterwards they decided to go with them to a fast food nearby.
I was like ""oh..okay sure, why not""
Haven't had anything to eat there.

Then we went to another pub/club named ""Ego"" and I bought a shot for myself(75% alcohol). I drank it and then I threw up because my stomach was empty.

Afterwards I went home and took a nap cause I had nothing else to do. I woke up 1 hour ago and tried to eat a little and then I purged cause my stomach started to hurt like hell (it wasn't even a binge) and I couldn't take it..after 2 months of being..kinda clean from purging.

I think he's just had enough at this point. Given the immense amount of anxiety he gets about all things, both related and not related to food, it takes tremendous courage and I give him props. The doctors and dietitians are trying to get him to 1200 calories a day, which he has met 3 out of the last 4 days. I know it's a small sample size, but there seems to at least be a profound shift in his approach. Two things he's looking for in an inpatient program are a nice outdoor space and a quiet space for reflection. He's doing the right thing and I'm proud of him.

1591,cdeixg,Insurance ends in 2 weeks and both scared &amp; excited for my planned relapse,"Inpatient, res, php, and now down to iop. 

My insurance coverage ends the end of this month and I’m still trying to figure out what to do about it. But that means instead of staying in iop for another 6 months like my team wants me to, I’ll be leaving only 2 months in. 

I know I’m not ready because I’m already planning a relapse, so says my team, that I don’t feel like is a relapse (losing “just a little weight” aka getting back down to my size before but in a “healthier way” aka by overexercising instead of just restricting food intake). 

Without insurance, I have no support and my body image has just proceeded to get worse and worse. I know I’m going to weigh myself as soon as I get home (partly as a means to fuel my ‘relapse’) and my team just tells me “bUt wHaT iF u DoNt”, like that helps at all. 

I want to move forward in life and be happy and well, but not if I can’t be in the body I want. And I hate that I STILL feel this way. 

I thought treatment was going to cure me but now I’m just fat (“within normal” medically) and sad, when at least before I was skinny and sad. 

If I do this again, I might die but if I don’t do it again, I feel like I can’t live. 

Maybe between now and the 31st I’ll wake up and somehow magically love my body or maybe I’ll get a tapeworm... one can dream...

1598,ccynm2,I just realized im deeper into the “Anorexia hole” than i thought,"It might be mild to some, but ive started to restrict what i eat to under 1000 cal a day starting last monday.

Ive been skimming through posts in this sub to convince myself im not that bad but im worried that i might be deeper than i thought. 

The line that made me realize this was along the lines of “Anorexia is rarely about being thin, its about control.” And that made me realize that today i was trying to make it without eating at all, but as time went on it was less about cutting calories and more about how disciplined i was and how much self-control i had gained since a week ago.

There was also a post that showed what “healthy” people do in situations surrounding food (such as snacking or eating things they weren’t expecting to) and i realized that in most of those cases i was not a “healthy” person. The one that hit me hard was the one that said “healthy people dont drown their hunger with water” which is exactly how ive been restricting myself recently.

We broke up about a year ago and then starting seeing each other again in March. That’s around the time I started loosing weight. Im also wondering why he never noticed that’s when it started happening. Im not sure if it’s directly related to us hanging out again. Normally my eating and cleaning habits are effected when I don’t have control over a situation. He might also just be clueless. 

I’m wondering how someone can still be attracted to someone whose lost so much weight? I feel almost more inclined to gain weight because I’m scared that he’s grossed out by the way I look and I’m so self conscious at times when I’m around him.

1608,cc2gik,How to handle refeeding for willing recoverer?,"One of my kids told us a month or so ago that she was suffering from anorexia. We of course noticed her extreme weight loss but naively thought it was just that her anxiety and depression at the end of the school year had caused her to lose her appetite.

Fortunately, she came to us for help. We're trying to meet with a nutritionist to help us, but in the meantime we're planning all of her meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner plus snacks after each meal.) This was based on the feedback of her therapist who is knowledgeable about eating disorders but not a specialist.

Most of the advice I've read online talks about how to handle refeeding for someone who doesn't really want to cooperate. Things like don't use napkins since they may hide food in them, or don't get up from the table until they're done eating, etc.

In a way, we have the opposite problem. She's incredibly hungry all the time, and she eats everything we give her. Unfortunately the weight gain is making her depressed as is the fact that even after she has a big meal and 3 largish snacks, she's *still* hungry all the time.

I think she's mostly returned to her old weight. My question is, should we actually reduce the portions we're giving her? Or should we encourage her to eat until she's full? Also as a bonus, anyone know how long that period lasts where the body is still recovering from starvation mode and is trying to get you to eat as much as you can when you can?",1562884736,7/11/2019 17:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cc2gik/how_to_handle_refeeding_for_willing_recoverer/,7

This has been an issue for about 4/5 years now. I was a very thin teenager and a lot of my peers would tell me how jealous they were of my body. I think maybe I want to experience that again, for people to tell me they wish they looked like me.

Most of the time I'm fine, my eating patterns are ok, my weight is healthy, and my self image is I think normal but when I get sad, or depressed, or anxious, everything gets a bit messed up.

Right now I hate my body. Logically I know I am quite thin, and that my weight is pretty healthy, but I can't help but look at my thighs and my stomach and my arms and my neck and think wow I wish all this was smaller.

I'll stop eating as much as I feel able, it usually starts with just eating like twice a day but I've gone up to 3 hours without eating anything. It feels almost good to be hungry. I know it really will not help my depressed mood but it makes me feel good when I lose a few pounds.

I'm scared this will grow to become something worse if I don't do something about it, but I don't think it's bad enough to get help.

I try to take better care of myself now, but I really want to loose like 30 lbs as fast as possible. Everyone tells me “I support your weight loss as long as it’s in a healthy way!” Which is so upsetting because that means everyone else thinks I’d look better 30 lbs less too. But, calorie counting drives me insane (literally), and I don’t know how to drop the weight without losing myself in the process.

It’s so easy to eat nothing, it’s so easy to eat it all and purge it after. Feels like hell, but more than doable. What’s really difficult is finding balance and knowing what’s not enough, what’s too much, and what’s right.

We have both had long conversation about our separate mental illnesses and have both agreed that we find edgy jokes about our respective eating disorders hilarious. We just feel comfortable enough around each other. And if one of us ever went too far we’d let the other person know. how ever we can’t make these jokes around her bf bc like i said he’s protective and hates them. which also makes me hyper aware. is there anything i can do? her bf and i used to be pretty close but don’t get along super well recently and he can tend to be stubborn and unable to admit when he’s wrong. but in the same boat he’s like my brother and i don’t want to push him away completely bc of what it would do for his gf (my bestfriend) and we both really love her and want her to be happy.

Because of that, I haven’t been able to pursue anything because I’m waiting on something without any real idea of when it will be coming. So i registered for school. I feel at ease with my choice and excited to be starting to work towards my career goals, But it’s an intensive program and i am absolutely terrified that my illness will hold me back or cause me to fail. 
Does anybody who’s gone through the motions have any advice on how to manage school (and succeed) while simultaneously living with a very active ed? I will continue therapy &amp; outpatient groups which i know might help, and this is a loaded question but any tips on how to not let your disorder take the front seat in your life while trying to prioritize something more important would be appreciated.

I started a relationship my sophmore year with a senior. Honestly, looking back there were a lot of red flags. Every time we’d do something sexual, he would show me porn after of very, VERY thin women as if it were an example for me. I don’t want to blame him, because he’s been very supportive in trying to get me to eat again, but I can’t bring myself to forgive him. 
It’s been a year and some months later since we began dating. I lost 20 lbs over the duration of my junior year, weighing roughly 116 lbs. that brings me to today, where I have lost another 5 lbs and I am trying to get below 100. I want to hit 80 someday. I’m 5’3”, so it isn’t out of the realm of possibility. 

My boyfriend also would talk about his exes bodies a lot early on. He would tell me everything he liked about them. He even showed me pictures he kept. He sometimes made offhand comments about my body, such as how in a photo I “look like a fat girl trying to hide the fact that she’s fat” or “your boobs are getting smaller.” 

I try to bring this stuff up now– since I didn’t realize how manipulative it was at the time– but he accuses me of dwelling on the past, and that if I can’t forgive and accept what he did, he’ll break up with me. 

My inability to talk about it has lead me to some obsessive tendencies, such as stalking pornstars that I remember him showing me as thinspo. I don’t get off to it, I just stare at it and cry sometimes that he would like me to look like that and I don’t.",1563863015,7/23/2019 1:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cgox8e/how_my_relationships_have_influenced_my_ed_rant/,7

1645,cgoh31,I thought I was in recovery but I’m not so sure anymore,"I added a trigger warning just in case because I wanted to talk about my body size. Also I may have posted something similar to this before but my ED has been really bad lately and I’m kind of a mess.

A couple years ago I was studying abroad (despite being hella poor) shortly after a severe allergic reaction that landed me in the hospital; these things combined meant I ate less than a thousand calories like in a weekend and averaged a walking/hiking distance of 15-20 miles. Like I lived off of bread, Nutella, fruit, and maybe one hot meal if I could afford in for 3-4 days out of the week. I loved it. I weighed less than I ever had and all my clothes practically fell off me.

Two years later and I’ve been back in the stages for a while and got myself into recovery. My loved ones were super supportive and I felt great for a little while. I think I’ve regressed though.

I started counting my calories again but I told myself it was to “make sure I was eating enough.” I constantly examine my body and hate to be naked for any period of time because then I can’t hide from myself.

When I was at my smallest my size was why most people consider normal or “healthy.” I have an auto immune disease that makes it hard to lose/not gain weight so now that I’m back to my original weight I’m considered overweight. I can feel people giving me disgusted looks again, I know they’re judging me but I can’t help it. I eat right, I exercise regularly, I love healthy but I can’t get back to where I was when I restricted.

I feel lost, I don’t know where to go or what to do. I’m going back to therapy on Friday but I crave that restriction again so horribly. People don’t tell me I “look great” anymore.",1563859890,7/23/2019 0:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cgoh31/i_thought_i_was_in_recovery_but_im_not_so_sure/,1

My best friend requested I seek help for ED behaviors so I did. Now I'm here. I can't bring myself to admit a problem even though I was diagnosed with AN. I just don't see one, this is how I've been around food on and off for 5 years now so maybe I'm just used to it. My therapist was also questioning previous diagnosis of anxiety and psychotic depression and wondering why I wasn't diagnosed with schizophrenia instead. It just feels like everything I've known about my mental health has been upended. It scares me. I'm scared of going back to inpatient, scared of having even a slight chance of being re-diagnosed. I know I'm dumb for googling stuff, I just have so many questions floating around like if this is even the right place to be venting.

1648,cglrg0,I found out my weight,"(TW there will be numbers) 

So yesterday I went to urgent care for a painful lump (I found out it was a swollen lymph node, so I’m doing ok) and they weighed me. I decided to look at my weight, and found that I gained roughly 34lb while in treatment. When I first developed my ED I weighed 304lb. Over a year or so I dropped to 232. I now weigh 266, which upsets me because I still don’t consider myself healthy. The professionals who monitor my weight tell me that gaining weight is normal after restricting for so long, and I believe them but I didn’t think it was THIS much weight. I’m just trying to accept the fact that my weight is where it is, and that as long as I’m eating good and exercising normally my body will eventually even out. And obviously if the weight gain wasn’t normal, they would have told me and taken action to fix it right? I’ve been maintaining for the past few months I’ve been out of treatment (up until now I had no clue what the number is, but they would tell me if I had gained or lost weight) so at least I know I’m not overeating I guess. I just have a jumble of emotions in my mind right now, and just needed to vent.

Also I added a trigger warning because I used a number that wasn’t time, just to be sure. Stay safe everyone and I hope you had a good day today!

My mom booked me for my first therapy session, with a 65 year old women who specializes in veteran and cancer affairs (along with grief, ptsd, and life-changes). I’m a nineteen year old who calculates her tdee every five minutes. She didn’t know what anything meant and I don’t think she picked up on some of my ticks, but she was super kind. And that made it a lil easier. I don’t think she and I will work but I promised my mom I’d go for one more session before school starts. The therapist and I didn’t get to divulge much into my ed but I talked to her a lot about how my mom is a huge trigger and I get overwhelmed by her easily, but I could never tell my mom that because then my mom lashes out and victimizes herself. That was nice to say out loud though. So it was okay. I didn’t cry from being overwhelmed so that’s good I guess. 

However. I came home and my mom made a huge dinner as a celebration for going to therapy (Mac and cheese, stuff with cream cheese, vegetables with oiLLLLL, and fried tofu) and I just ran up to my room and cried. I’m never gonna get better until I can go back to college god help me

1653,cgjim1,I need to vent.,"English is not my first language, so i will make some stupid mistakes and I'm sorry. Also, I don't know if this needs a TW ? probably not ? I will put one to be sure.

Okay, so I knew about Anorexia for a long time, I know what it is, I know the effects on your body, on your mental health... I was really interested on the subjects, and did some research... and one of my closest friend is recovering from it (and she is doing great, like she can eat cookies and food like that, i'm so happy for her) so I really thought that i was the last person who would end up in the situation i'm in now.

Nothing to worry about, i think, but still...
I don't like my body, I'm 16, no one likes its body during adolescence. I want to lose weight, I don't like sport. I don't know how,  i ended up thinking ""yeaaah, starving is not a good diet, it's just the easiest way to end up being trapped in Anorexia, and struggling with it for years, with sometimes no hope for recovery, but... I want to look good for when i come back to school in september !""
I don't want to look too skinny though. Like, not being like a squeleton, just have a flat stomach and thin hands.   

I counted my calories for like, five days, but when I started to be supper upset when I ate more than 900 calories a day I was like ""Okay, it's NOT looking good, I need to stop"". I think I lost like one kilogram or something in five days. I'm not sure, my scale is weird.

I'm forced to eat every day, i live with my parents, and my mom is really careful with that kind of stuff. Like, she notice really easily when I don't eat a lot. I have great parents, I really do. And I enjoy eating, but then after, I'm alone in my room, and I feel all the food in my stomach, and i feel really bad.

I purged a bit also. I don't like it. I know all the side effects, I know how dangerous it is, I know that it's not really efficient. but i still do it sometimes. Less than before (a few weeks ago, I would go into the bathroom with food that I liked when I was sure my parents were in another part of the apartment, i would eat it very fast with a lot of water, and purge in the bathtub. gross. but it felt good :""(   )

I feel bad when I eat a lot, I started to do a bit of sports. I don't count my calories, but I like to do an approximation of my daily intakes. I tried to stay under 1000, though I don't think that I'm good at it. 
I like food ! but I don't like how I have no control when it comes to it. I don't really binge ? Eating a lot because I have a family thing like birthdays and stuff, yes but I don't' have this sort of ""crisis"", eating a lot on the bathroom to purge after it yes, but I stay conscious, I know what I'm doing sort of. 
Yeah it's messy sorry.

I have a bad relationship with eating and with my body, that's for sure.
But I also feel like i'm doing all this on purpose, to make myself interesting. 
Faking an eating disorder kind of stuff. But that's messed up, why would I do this ???? I talked to no one about my ""problems"". (well, expect this post)

So yeah. My parents will be away for two weeks. I will use this time alone to eat as little as I can. I know I shouldn't. But I want to starve. I'm a terrible person. What kind of monster wants to starve ? 

 I want to have a eating disorder to lose weight. Worst idea ever. I don't want to stop, but I should.
Recovery takes years, my hairs will fall, I will have struggles doing the tiniest effort, my grades will drop, I will end up alone, my family will be worried, i will destroy my life, but I want to be skinny !

sorry, this was way too long, way too dramatic, and my presentation is terrible, but I needed this.",1563831911,7/22/2019 16:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cgjim1/i_need_to_vent/,0

I’m not in a position where i can freely present but bind anyway for myself to feel comfortable (im non-binary, wanting to appear more masc). My thighs and chest triggers my body dysmorphia the most as I hate the parts of myself that make me ‘feminine’, i always wish my fat distribution was similar to male bodies and if i was like that i know i wouldnt be so hell bent on restricting myself constantly. 

anyone else with similar struggles? 

i also have the same issues with having control many others have, so i cant say its solely due to my self-loathing of my feminine body, just one of the factors why i keep trying so hard.

1687,cewwxq,Anorexia was misperceived as a cocaine addiction.,"Hello, I am a 20 year old male who recently started recovering from an intense bout of anorexia thought I'd share my story here.

This isn’t the first bout I dealt with as I experienced it a few times as a teenager, but this winter it returned and got worse than it’s ever been before. I wasn’t in the best place leading up to winter and around November I started losing weight.  I live in northeast and winters can be pretty brutal up here. I also work at a busy restaurant in a ski town where we are very short staffed. I am one of two busers that work there, and my coworker/buser is very lazy and would show up intoxicated most shifts and would generally do very little, leaving me to bus almost the whole restaurant on my own. I had already started to lose weight around November and by the time mid January arrived I had gotten really skinny. Around this time business really started to pick up as we entered busy season. I was stretched so thin at work that all shift I'd pretty much have to run around and do damage control. So on top of my eating disorder I was dealing with a lot of stress from work. And all my coworkers noticed. However, none of them thought I had an eating disorder and all of them thought I had a coke problem. They talked about it a lot behind my back. I’m have Bipolar, which I had been off my meds for, and paired with my lack of eating, had greatly thrown off my mood. My coworkers noticed this as well and wrongly attributed it to cocaine. It progressively got worse until mid march where business slowly down and I moved into a new apartment. I was less stressed out and I began eating more. My coworkers then started to show me more support and would often ask about how I was doing with the new apartment. That was nice to receive but it still hurt a lot to have everyone think I was addicted to coke when I was struggling with anorexia. People judged me, lost respect for me, and spread rumors about me. I don’t like playing the victim card but I honestly feel a little betrayed and thought my coworkers would have had more respect for me than that. What gets me is that those two things are very different and if someone would have reached out to me they might have discovered what was up, but instead of reaching out to me they all just talked about it behind my back. I don’t know who to share this with so I just thought I’d share it here. Thank you to all who will read this, it does help.",1563477599,7/18/2019 14:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cewwxq/anorexia_was_misperceived_as_a_cocaine_addiction/,8

1711,cjrrmu,Gaining weight outpatient,"So my therapist brought up the most terrifying words in my mind yesterday -- higher level of care. I have been seeing my therapist since January and I haven't gained any weight yet. I've gained a few pounds, but was never able to keep the weight on. I have had anorexia for 11 years and I've been in therapy for the majority of that time and I've also been inpatient twice.

I have about 10 pounds to gain to not be underweight and I just feel like I can't go through inpatient again at this point. I was in a mentally dark place both times I was inpatient and I was crying nonstop. Plus, the rate of weight gain is so quick in the inpatient program I would return to (it's in one of the best hospitals in the U.S.) and I remember having a mental breakdown over how quickly I was putting on weight each morning before I got weighed. In addition, the goal weight they have set for me means that I have to gain almost 17 pounds, which is so inconceivable for me right now. I don't really want to gain weight, but I know that I have to and I'm trying to trust my therapist because I really like her and I know she has my best interests in mind.

**Anyway, for anyone that managed to gain weight on an outpatient basis, how did you do it and handle the anxiety and stress that came along with it?** I am able to see my weight when my therapist weighs me and seeing the number go up (even though I know it has to) makes me scared to keep eating so much. I honestly am eating more than I ever have on my own (I'm 26) and I have never been this motivated to keep trying. I'm currently eating 3 meals and 3 snacks a day and my metabolism has always been really high, so putting on weight is impossible (I was put on 4,000 calories both times due to inadequate weight gain when I was inpatient, which wasn't that common). I feel like I'm constantly eating and my body isn't responding.",1564493286,7/30/2019 8:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cjrrmu/gaining_weight_outpatient/,1

My brain just tells me its not even worth trying to eat and i know i need to. But then i do and i just feel sick and think about how i shouldn't have. I hate this. I feel like im stuck back where i dont need to be. And to top it off today i was informed by my doctor i was skating by being underweight. I just want to stay recovered... so its 5 am and im just crying because its crazy how fast this takes over my life again..,1564478307,7/30/2019 4:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cjp81z/this_is_already_hard_enough/,0

1716,cjlcjw,Is it still anorexia?,"I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and anorexia nervosa. I took a year off law school and went through 3 AN treatment facilities and am in recovery now, but I can’t eat and It doesn’t feel the same as AN. I like being underweight, but for the first time it scares me bc I CANT EAT. I’m never hungry and when i am putting food in my mouth, it disgusts me ( i get shivers and gaggy) and the interest in eating goes away. I have dreams about eating and I can eat normally in my dreams, but in real life i have such an aversion to food. 

I’ve been fainting or having seizures. My mom witnessed one and swears it was a seizure, but the ER doc who put staples in my head thinks I just fainted, and i somewhat agree. I get very dizzy upon standing and have 0 energy to do anything. I shake uncontrollably. 

When I was in my ED I still had an appetite, and wanted to eat more, but now I don’t. It just feels very different from anorexia nervosa and if something doesn’t change I’m afraid I might actually die this time. Idk what to do. Everybody blames everything on the eating disorder and it just feels so different this time that I think there might be something more but I have no idea what that could be. 

My BMI is in the 14’s and I really feel like I’m just completely unable to eat enough calories to sustain my life and I’m afraid because it really, really might kill me this time and I don’t feel like I have any control over it, like i did in the past. I’m also afraid that all my symptoms are so easily blamed on the anorexia and depression diagnosis that something more might be at play and it would just go completely unnoticed by medical professionals. 

Everyday tasks are so difficult, they’re insurmountable. I don’t know how to tell this to anybody because it’s so easily explained by anorexia nervosa and depression. 

Maybe it’s just me wanting it to not be a mental illness, but a physical one that has me convinced that it must be something different. 

I don’t know what to do at this point I feel like I’ve exhausted all my options. 

What do i do?",1564453604,7/29/2019 21:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cjlcjw/is_it_still_anorexia/,5
1717,cjklex,I just went through my old posts of when I fell deepest into anorexia,"I feel so heartbroken. heartbroken for myself. seeing how little I valued myself because of my weight, despite being so severely underweight already. I saw myself shrink both physically and in self-love in a span of 5 years. my clothes got looser and so did my grip to reality. and as I scrolled through each post that pushed me to dive deeper into my ED, each body check and wistful update, it just broke my heart to see how I talked to myself back then. I wish I knew that I didn't deserve any of what this mental battle made me believe. that it's a distorted reality of control. that it's not worth it. all those hours slumped over the edge of the toilet bowl vomiting until nothing but blood and bile comes up, it's not worth it. going for days on nothing but water and tea to nearly pass out, it’s not worth it. watching your friends disappear and hang out without you because you're too afraid of going out to eat, it's not worth it. the countless heart palpitations, hair loss, dizziness, and numbing fatigue, none of it is worth it. my 14 year old self deserved better. my 16 year old self deserved better. and I still deserve better. the girl I see in the mirror is worth more than what the glass reflects.

I continued with purging or not eating and gained weight that I really didn’t want. It all started when a boy I liked told me I was fat so even if he did like me, he would rather be with someone else. Fast forward to college, I went away so that I could have more freedom, but instead my anorexic tendencies got worse. I didn’t eat for days at a time and when I did eat I ate very little. I guess you could say I ran on adrenaline. I lost xx lbs through my first semester and I was very proud of myself. Then I met a guy, someone who is very caring and he saw me writing in my food journal. I remember he didn’t like it and he wanted me to change. He helped a lot. We had just started dating. I wanted to change for me and him. We broke up last night. All today I didn’t have an appetite, yesterday I didn’t eat dinner. I’m scared of falling back into my old routine. I don’t know what to do. I don’t notice not eating for days at a time and he always reminded me that I had to eat. When I got sick he would buy me food and have me eat so I could have energy to get better. But now thats over and I’m starting to feel like I used to. I should probably also add that I use food as a punishment. When I’m unsatisfied or upset, I don’t eat. My depression helped fuel my anorexic and bulimic tendencies so now I’m really scared. I don’t want to disappoint anyone but today looking in the mirror I couldn’t help but think how much more unsatisfied I was with my body and the way I looked and the numbers on the scale.

I truly feel like my life is unpredictable and crazy, and messed up. And there's so many things I don't have any say whatsoever in, except for my body and food intake.

I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa a year ago. I've been in recovery for half a year after I got out od inpatient,and gained a lot of weight,more or less fine with it,learning to cope.

However,for a few months now I've been living at my host-family's place,and I'm really concerned about this man I'm living with. They don't know about my history with eds,but they've noticed I tend to have an unusual eating pattern. Only this guy asked me numerous times,if he should be concerned,if everything's okay,and stuff. He definitely suspects it.
I can easily tell that he does have disordered eating,he barely eats,and only eats low cal stuff,and definitely is skinny. I understand the real meaning behind his sentences whenever he talks about ""dieting"". 

I think he is in the state of denial, and I would like him to talk to a therapist,but have no idea how to initiate that talk. Maybe I should talk to him about my past? Make him believe that we understand eachother? Even if I share these experiences with him,how in the hell do I talk about this when I'm only a guest,and even though we have a friendly relationship it's pretty formal,but him and his family are basically mine's best friend and he's 25 years older than me?

1763,chxe2k,Struggling with eating quick meals,"This is my first time posting, so hi everyone. Also this is more of a vent, but I felt that the trigger warning flair was more important to add. 

Anyways at the worst of my eating disorder I went vegan, with a whole bunch of restrictions on top of being plant-based. Since then I’ve stuck with being vegan, but for the animals and not for restriction. I guess you could say my relationship with food is better now. Since I’ve started my recovery I’m more comfortable eating foods that have oils and are processed when in the past I wouldn’t. However, I still struggle a bit every now and then, and I guess right now I am struggling. 

As of late things have been pretty bad. At the beginning of summer I started counting calories again, but since a month ago I have stopped. I’m currently in a situation where I don’t buy veggie “meats” very often and I feel that that has improved my relationship with food because I find myself more inspired to cook. In addition, it has been good on my wallet too, because I find myself using up a lot of the groceries I buy. However, my lack of buying these pre-made, quick and easy veggie “meats” has in some way warped my relationship with food, yet again. Just recently I bought a pack of veggie nuggets, and I’ve eaten them all within a day, because they are there and they are easy to make. But after I eat them I find myself feeling guilty for eating these processed foods. Even though I know they are not high in calories and that calories don’t matter I still feel ashamed and feel like i need to compensate with “healthier” and “cleaner” foods to eat. 

It just sucks to feel this way. I feel like it will never end. Even when I think my relationship with food is better my ed still finds its way back into my life. I feel like I can’t even think about food sometimes without triggering myself and falling back into disordered eating.",1564109937,7/25/2019 21:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/chxe2k/struggling_with_eating_quick_meals/,0

1777,cncpvd,Lady at store humiliating her daughter and using me as a “good” example of what a healthy girl should look like,Honestly this was awful. Because I was just shopping around for some shirts and my style is that I buy some shirts bigger on purpose because I like a more looser baggier fit sometimes. So I was just shopping around and this women was next to me making small talk kind of like asking me what grade I was in and whatever. And so I was just saying I was shopping for some more shirts and she sorta ask what size? And I thought that was sorta weird because she also asked my grade and age and not being rude I just told her and I told her because I thought she might be like those shirts are too big for you or whatever I mean she was nice but also a little I don’t know. So I told her and she scoff and said that she was looking for clothes for her daughter (younger than me) and couldn’t find anything nice because of how big she was. And she pointed over to her. And I could tell this lady was just being a bitch because her daughter yes was a tad overweight maybe 10-15 pounds but not drastic. And so her daughter comes over and is saying she found something that she liked blah blah blah. And this lady starts going off to her like “well you would have found more if you would just loose some weight. This nice girl here is older than you and is smaller” and she just kept pointing over at me using me as a good example of what a nice pretty girl should look like. And I was just standing their awkwardly and sorta trying to walk away. I now wish I said something but I didn’t I just felt bad for this girl. And I’m not healthy and it just made me so mad to see that because that’s the type of stuff that made me start to self harm then start to skip meals and eat less than I should and to at a young age throw away my whole basket of Easter candy and goodies then say I couldn’t find it. Just because I was worried I would get fat or that I was already fat. And my habit of since like I don’t even remember or throwing away most and sometimes all of my lunch at school that my dad packs for me. No one should ever compare that girl to anyone else like that. Yes being overweight can be unhealthy but exercise and a healthy diet is the answer not making her feel bad and telling her she is not as good as someone else. Also what was annoying about this is that the mother said that i am what her daughters body should look like to be healthy since I’m actually not healthy and I’m not what her daughter should look like. I admit its nice to walk into a store and put on the smallest sizes and have them fit but I’m sick not healthy and I can see that but it took me getting here to see that to a point that’s it a addiction and a mindset that’s hard to get rid of and I don’t wish on my worse enemy much less a sweet girl.,1565217021,8/7/2019 17:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cncpvd/lady_at_store_humiliating_her_daughter_and_using/,12

Now my ED and my addiction go hand in hand. I can't get sober because the weight gain makes me relapse. I can't recover from my ED because losing weight from just using will trigger me to restrict as much as possible.

Recently my best friend lost an insane amount of weight in only a few months. At first she said it was because she just started cooking at home. And I honestly believe this is what started it because before she literally ate fast food every single night and I am not exaggerating. She lost a little weight and maintained it for awhile. She looked good and healthy but then she lost a ton of weight really fast. 
And today she told me she was Anorexic because she went to the dr and got diagnosed after noticing hair falling out due to malnutrition. 
I felt like something might’ve been wrong with her because she lost so much weight so quickly and would constantly talk about how she couldn’t eat much because she was getting so nauseated and having stomach issues. I kind of wrote that off though because every time I was actually with her and we went out to eat she ate just as much if not more than me. 
I’m not sure how I can help her feel like herself again? What are some ways I can support her without being a pushy drag to the point where she doesn’t even want to see me? For those in recovery what are things that have really helped?

1843,cq0kd5,Relapsing and I don't know what to do,"Couldn't decide between vent and trigger warning so I went with the latter.

So the first time I became anorexic I was 13. A friend of mine had gotten into diets and tracking calories and showed me an app for it when we were casually talking about it. Out of pure curiosity I tried it out - and 2 weeks later I was faced with a full grown Eating Disorder. I was only 2 months anorexic, my prime time was 1 month. But boy was it hard. I never let myself become too underweight but I was underweight when I was at my worst. And then I decided that that wasn't worth the pain so I got out of it. Kinda.

I've had tendencies ever since but for the most part, my relationship with food was healthy. And right now I'm relapsing.

I don't really know what triggered it. I'm not fat, I'm struggling a bit with lower belly fat and my tighs could be slimmer, but I'm at a healthy weight. I've been getting into the anorexic mindset for weeks now but could ignore it and move on. But on Friday, I heard someone in P.E. say ""Wow, you're fat."" That person was standing behind me, I don't know if he meant me or anyone else   and even if, he says a lot of things he doesen't mean. But that did it for me. And since Friday I've been counting calories, thinking about food non-stop and restricting myself.

And it sucks. And you know what sucks more? My non existent discipline. One minute I'm starving myself, the next I'm being okay with my body and eating casually. Then an hour passes and I feel guilty and wanna starve myself again. And then the cycle repeats itself. It's just so tiring and I don't feel like I'm at a dangerous point rn but I'm not far away from it. I wanna be underweight and skinny and I wanna starve myself. But I also wanna be healthy and enjoy eating. I just can't bring myself to do either of this. One minute I have a good relationship with food, the next I don't. Anyone else out there?

1849,cppc0d,A camping trip made me relapse.,"(Long but please read. I put a TW because the first paragrapgh could be interpeted as thinspo.)


I used to struggle hard with anorexia. Growing up I always got comments telling me how skinny and pretty I was. I recall my mom telling me that ""It's a good thing you're thin. Fat girls don't look good in your style."" I confused thin with beauty and when I started to gain weight during puberty, my world fell apart. The most of 7th grade year was me dealing with my disorder and giving into it. Eventually I was able to break free. I managed to beat anorexia on my own but it's coming back and I'm scared.


Every year my family goes on a camping trip, 3 days, in the deep forest with no signal. This year they brought along 2 other families that I didn't really know. I suffer from massive anxiety as well, and part of that anxiety makes it so that I can't eat in front of people unless I'm 100% comfortable with everyone. The first night was a potluck. Everyone is expected to eat together, so I made the excuse that I was tired and went to bed. In the morning I ""slept in"" to avoid breakfast and went on a small hike right before lunch was announced. I avoided every meal announcement. The entire trip was like that. At the end of those three days I had eaten only an apple and half a bag of chips. But what felt worse then the hunger was me realizing how good it felt to be hungry. I missed everything about anorexia and I still do. I'm scared. I don't want to relapse. I don't want to go back.",1565678686,8/13/2019 1:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cppc0d/a_camping_trip_made_me_relapse/,2

Hi!

When she was first diagnosed I was able to be around for her more since it was the semester before nursing school started and I was only taking 2 classes that semester, so I had a ton of free time. I’m honestly barely home during the school year, always studying or going to class. My first semester of NS (Fall 2018) my sister was like “she’s barely ever home..” I’m not totally sure if she meant that in a good way or a bad way though, but yeah.

1868,cp1tgm,Just over one week into treatment and here's my little win...,"I've just come the end of my second weekend (first week) in a residential programme.

Here I am as another Sunday rolls around. It's kinda hard to understand that I've been in this centre for just over a week now. I came in here under a huge amount of distress, having been admitted to A&amp;E the day before for suicidal ideation and hyper anxiety due to the lack of access to the support I've needed for months.

I truly don't know where the last week went; I can't remember much of it. I've learnt that loss of short term memory is part of what happens when the body goes through trauma and shuts down non-necessary functions in order to survive. Without knowing it my brain has turned into cave man mode. The science behind all of this is incredible.

It's been a really tough week; lots of deep therapy dives into my brain, while being under some heavy doses of meds to keep me from going crazy. And as a 36yr old male, living in a house of women is a bit difficult too. I'm sure you can imagine why (and I honestly don't mean that in any sexist way). It's a difficult thing to accept that the eating disorder part of my issues is so stigmatised and even more so when you are an older male.

So here's where I get to my little win for the week. One of the girls here is 18; a big age difference mentally and in maturity between us. During a group therapy session we were asked to deliver positive affirmations to each other. She told me in very simple terms that ""I was kicking stigma in the stones"". That has stuck with me. It has given me hope that she could see that in me.

This week I will be focussing on beginning to learn more about the deeper causes of all this. It will be difficult. It's likely it will bring up things I've hidden or run from, or simply didn't realise.

Please keep me in your thoughts, and send positive vibes if/when you can. I really do appreciate it, and come back to these messages very often.

Stay well, and mind yourselves. There's no-one more important in your life than you.",1565554913,8/11/2019 15:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cp1tgm/just_over_one_week_into_treatment_and_heres_my/,4

I'm an ftm guy, who struggled with anorexia like 4 ish years ago? I didn't ever get hospitalized but I did lose a significant amount of weight. Most of it has been gained back, as I've been on an uphill recovery climb after a couple years of struggling. However the thoughts of losing that much weight again never really go away. 

I've recently started Hrt and have been wanting to gain muscle, and get in shape in a healthy way. It's been hard though, since every time I start to get on track with my eating and exercise, the thoughts of ""What if i did this and wasnt healthy about it"" start to come back and I basically have to take a step back and stop so I don't start starving myself again. The side of my brain that never really recovered from my ED cant seem to comprehend that I have to gain weight to gain muscle.

Everytime I think I’ve made progress, bam. I break a rule and weigh myself. While I’m at more functional weight, I can’t seem to stop fasting or restricting. I swear I’m not doing this intentionally. I managed to gain about twenty pounds since January, but in the last two weeks I lost ten pounds. Eight months of progress and I’m losing it quickly. Boyfriend is starting to notice and I don’t know what to tell him. 

I keep giving away all the food I make. I’ll spend an hour cutting vegetables and cooking with the intention to eat it, but I just end up feeding friends and family. I feel like I need someone to make sure I actually eat. Being an adult with mental illness is rough. I might need to commit myself to an institution before I’m forced into it again. I’ve been to the psych ward far too many times in the last three years. 

I’m wasting money on fruits and vegetables because I can’t bring myself to eat. I don’t know what sparked this recent weight loss. The last couple days I’ve been bloated, and it’s just making things worse. I can’t help but feeling a sense of joy when I see that lower number on the scale. I’m sorry, I don’t really know how the close this rant.

1872,cozua2,My mom knows and I hate it,"Ever since my mom found out I stopped eating, she's been so insufferable. Constantly nagging, yelling, just being an overall bitch to me about it in general. She often goes on about a ""deal"" we supposedly made about me eating (probably when I said I was trying my hardest to eat and she just said try harder), and gets really mad at me when I don't. 

I hate it, I fucking hate everything she's doing but I dont know how to break it to her that she's making my mental health a lot worse than it was when no one knew.

I get that she cares, but I just need to step off and let me deal with this myself. People always say you can't heal in the same environment in which you were harmed, and as long as I live with my family I know I can't recover.

Sorry for ranting, but I just needed to get this off my chest. Anyone with similar experiences, or advice?",1565545736,8/11/2019 12:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cozua2/my_mom_knows_and_i_hate_it/,5

I've been in my recovery process for about 4 months. My history with anorexia has been tough and every time I attempt to recover it was because of bodybuilders. I loved the way they looked. I wanted to be strong. This time around my relationship with food is much better. I lift weights and I've gained a good amount of muscle mass. I eat a caloric surplus and most days I'm ok. I decided to watch the movie 'to the bone' today and I really come to realize that those thoughts are always on the back of my mind. I always have them there but the only thing I love more then this sickness is being strong and when I can't workout, or eat the healthy foods I want I start remembering all of it. I still feel guilty for skipping workouts. From on obsession to another. I hate that sometimes I miss being hungry, or playing the ""how long can I go without food"" game. I like the way it feels to wrap my hands around my legs and be able to touch my fingers together. It never fucking gets out of my head. I'll always think about it when people comment on how much food I eat.

1882,cobc7x,I need some advice!,"This is hard to admit, but I guess I should talk about it. I feel like such a bad human being for it, but it's also destroying me inside.

So I've had a bad  relationship with food for about 10 years now, but never really got diagnosed with an ED by a professional. I just know that I am very unhealthy when it comes to food and eating. I'm trying to see a therapist this years aswell, but that takes time since they don't have any free slots for new patients atm. 

So.. I don't know when that first happened, but I just can't deal with people who'te dieting, talks  about calories and stuff like that. Why? I don't know. Because I am afraid that they'll slip into an ED? Because I am afraid i'm not the skinniest anymore cause that's all I have and that's what defines me? Because I feel bad cause I am not 'starving' myself atm and trying to be healthy while they are allowed to do that? I really don't know. I just know that it really bugs me.

My brother is overweight and I think he's on a diet now, which is good cause his weight is unhealthy. He didn't tell me about his diet, but I noticed healthier food in the house and he doesn't sewm to eat much tbh. He also weighs himself everyday. I also have to say that he is depressed so... I don't know. 

All I can think about is him losing weight and what a failure I am. I KNOW that he has to lose weight to be healthy, but it scares me that he's weighing hinself everyday and that he doesn't seem to eat. I can't talk to him about that; I've tried but we just don't get along and rarely talk to begin with.

What can I do? Am I a bad person?


Tldr:

My overweight brother is trying to lose weight, but I noticed that he's barely eating and that he's weighing himself everyday. I don't know if I'm worried about him or if I just don't want anyone to get thinner because I see that as conpetition.",1565398834,8/9/2019 20:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cobc7x/i_need_some_advice/,5

I told her to keep being real, that she is strong enough to fight this, even though it’s so hard, and that she has so many people who love her, and she doesn’t have to fight this alone.

I was sitting down at a table, when this other girl comes over and sits beside me. We made small talk when she noticed I was on my phone instead of eating. 

""Are you just gonna be on your phone this entire time?"" It was an innocent question, so I just said yeah, and tried to continue with what we were talking about earlier.

She must've been really curious, because she asked why I was eating, and I just said ""I'm not really hungry, and it would feel weird."" (This is my cookie cutter response.) She wasn't satisfied, so she hit me with ""What? Are you depressed or something?"" I was absolutely shocked at how casual she was, saying it. 

I haven't been able to stop thinking abou it since, and I'm really scared people can tell. The last thing I need is people to know that I had a problem in the first place, let alone relapsed.

1892,cnx0av,My dream is to my own my bakery or at least it was,"Now I don’t know I sorta just had it all in my head mapped out because I love baking. When I bake I do in fact taste test while I’m baking I usually don’t actually eat a portion of the finished product sometimes I do but usually I don’t and days when I bake those little taste test is all I eat because they make me feel disgusting. I love making them and how much other enjoy them. But at school in English class we were sorta just talking about our dream future careers at my table. And I said that I wanted to own my own bakery one day. And they sorta just laughed and said but all you eat is paper you don’t eat real food. And see the background to this is from a few months prior to that day we were talking about our favorite foods and I go from eating more to eating less to days when I just completely despise food so I was despising food that day so they were like “do you like bagels” and I just kept saying no to everything saying it all tasted disgusting. So they were like “well what do you eat so you don’t die then since you hate everything?” They were just joking but me being a awkward person something I do is just act like a total idiot to get out of the situation. So I tore a piece of paper and shoved it in my mouth and said “Me love paper” “paper yummy in my tummy” and they started laughing their heads of and I actually chewed the paper then swallowed it. (Does anyone know what happens when you eat paper I mean it was a tiny piece but still is it bad to do I mean I don’t actually eat paper just that one time) So they were laughing their heads off thus me only eating paper came in to play. Anyway all this laughing on how I would own my own bakery and not eat anything. Made me think of how it was a stupid idea. Why do I even bake or cook? I remember being little and getting up early to make pancakes then just not them at that age I didn’t even know what I was doing it was just I like making them since it’s fun but I don’t want to eat them. It’s stupid. I mean I made a chocolate and coconut cake a few weeks ago and I didn’t even test taste it while baking and I didn’t have a slice either I just made it, put it on a cake stand and watched the days go by of it getting eaten by my family members and I didn’t even feel like it was weird.

1906,ctb0fv,I’m starting to think my mom is an enabler,"I’ve recently been coming to terms with the fact that my eating habits are unhealthy and there’s a reason I’m underweight. With that I’ve noticed that my mom was a big reason I’ve been in denial for so long. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for about 5 years now for other mental health reasons and he’s always mentioned he’s been worried about my weight. I just turned 18 a little bit ago so my mom was in the room for most of our appointments before  recently. Whenever he’d bring up his concern my mom would jump in and say that my dad was just skinny and I take after my dad. At one point my dr asked me what I ate in a typical day and I was having trouble thinking of an answer, my mom piped in and started telling him how I was a picky eater and pretty much just ate ramen all the time. It sounded true enough, when I ate I did mostly eat ramen but she piped in so quick it was like she didn’t want me to think about how little I eat  in a day. A couple years ago I was hospitalized for 3 days because my dr thought I was under a lot of stress and a suicide risk. Within that time the drs often told me I needed to eat more or they’d have to put in a feeding tube. I got myself to eat enough for the few days so they’d let me go home and not have to use the tube. On the way home from the hospital my mom started to tell me how the drs took her aside at one point and told her they were worried because I wasn’t eating. She said she told them it was just because I was picky and didn’t want hospital food but even then I thought to myself “No, I just wasn’t hungry.” My moms never shown much concern for my eating besides pointing out when I’ve been eating a lot in a day and I’m starting to wonder if there may be a reason for that. One of my clearest memories with her was once when they took my weight at the drs I was about 115 lbs (which is the most I’ve ever weighed and the last time my BMI was in the normal range) and my mom shouted “Wow, you’re getting fat.”. More than that I remember the look of shock on the nurse’s face as she said “No no no, just growing.” I don’t see why she’d want me not eating or why she’d want me so skinny but as I’m becoming more self aware her lack of concern doesn’t make sense. Everywhere else I go people tell me I need to eat more + gain weight.

That friend however told me 2 weeks ago she needed some space and didn’t want to associate with me anymore for a while. The reason being that i had a relapse into drug abuse (amphetamine and ketamine) and she couldn’t deal with the pain and effort of helping me again. Her message made me quit the drugs again entirely since she is way more important to me then some stupid powder, however she didn’t feel like making up yet, still stating she needed space. I completely understand where she is coming from, i just feel so alone and unsupported without her. I had a relapse into my ED again this week again because of that, i have been starting counting calories and now i starved myself for 2 days. I don’t want to tell her because i don’t want to guilt trip her, on the other hand i really need her.

1920,csbmrw,Need advice on restrictive eating and journey to recovery,"I’ve been dealing with eating disorder for over a year never admitted it to myself it’s just something I did to maintain my weight after doing keto (lost 50 pounds) for me being overweight was the visual embodiment of the pain I was dealing with at the time. I was reclusive and spent all day sleeping and binging at night. I decided I would lose the weight by doing keto and keeping fit, I achieved my goal and from there my eating disorder started I would track my calories everyday and if I went over I would just puke up just enough for me to assume I’m on my daily calorie intake.

This past year I went through a stressful period and developed IBD ( still awaiting  for diagnosis had my blood test) maintaining this routine has been a nightmare. 6 weeks ago I noticed I had gained over 15 pounds in just few weeks of not tracking calories. I decided to restrict myself to 1900 calories, and would just snack throughout the day and eat a meal before bed. I’ve realised I overestimate my meals so that number is inaccurate I was probably consuming 1500-1700 a day. My digestive problems during this period improved and I was also losing weight. Few days ago I realised I started experiencing dizziness and feeling cold all the time pain in my bones. I checked the scale and in 6 weeks I lost 33 pounds. I look anorexic and I went into panic mode and decided I would start eating again.

I’m currently on day 4 of eating normally again, first day I consumed 2300 then 3500 second day,  4200  third day and today I only consumed 2200. I’m concerned after reading online about refeeding syndrome and how it’s fatal would I be at risk? During the last 6 weeks I had cheat days where I consumed over 3000-4000 calories (birthday meal family gathering and holidays) i would assume since I still did have cheat days this would not apply to me?  (I didn’t eat less than a 1000 calories), It’s been 4 days since I’ve been eating normal and I’m having a panic attack that I may be at risk

Lately the past year since losing my brother to gang kidnapping and murder, I've been unmotivated to eat and take care myself. Currently I don't like the living situation I'm in, I get extremely irritated daily with everyone, I view the poeple in my town as rude overweight savages who only want to see others in pain. Before he passed, I was focused on bulking, skateboarding, and didn't really have any negativity in my life. Currently I have to force my self to get up and cook, my normal appetite is gone and I have gotten used to having an empty stomach daily. I want to get better but theres many things that get me so angry on a daily basis, I lost the motivation to care for myself and be positive. It is a factor of lots of things including losing my brother, I live by myself  and don't have anyone to rely on. I know its seems I need to vent to poeple about my situation and chat with a therapist but I lost hope in humanity and being positive. I even told a consoler about my anger and frustrations about my brothers case but ended up getting angry at the dumb consoler. Having a speech impediment its difficult to talk to someone that's not jerk and expressing my feelings. Being a 5'07 Male, I went from 135lbs to 105lbs, I feel more tired each day and don't know what to do from here.",1566163338,8/18/2019 16:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cs7awj/not_sure_where_to_start/,6

1938,crhdd9,I want to try out for basketball,"(TW numbers) 

I’m currently a senior in High school and I want to try out for basketball. A little backstory: I have had a restrictive type eating disorder (I don’t really want to call it anorexia, because I weigh 266lb at 5’7 so I’m not underweight) and I’ve had a rough past few years. I developed my eating disorder over a year ago, and I originally was at 304lb. I dropped down to 230 and then I was put into treatment. Now I’m at 266. I am struggling with the weight gain during treatment and I am very self conscious. Anyways, I told my dad that I wanted to try out, and he said “I mean you can try...” in a very unenthusiastic way. I asked him if he thinks I would make the team and he said “well you might. But you have to get in shape.” This has fucked me up pretty bad. I’ve already started to relapse on the first week of school, and here’s my dad (who knows I have an eating disorder) telling me that I’m out of shape and probably wouldn’t make the basketball team. I am tempted to go into a full on relapse just to prove that I can lose the weight, and that I didn’t just randomly gain 36lb. I feel ashamed and put down by what he said, and I no longer want to try out because I feel like no matter how good I am at basketball, they won’t accept me because I’m fat and I look unappealing. I also wanted to try out for volleyball, but that’s a whole other beast. 

TLDR: I want to try out for basketball but my dad essentially told me I wouldn’t make it because I’m fat.",1566015152,8/16/2019 23:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/crhdd9/i_want_to_try_out_for_basketball/,0
1939,crh6kk,worried that i’m becoming anorexic or developing an eating disorder.,"the past two weeks i’ve had absolutely no appetite. this is coming from someone who would eat four HEAVY meals a day and constantly think about food and eating food. now, it’s the opposite. i used to have the biggest appetite, even three weeks ago i was eating a burger, fries, drink, my siblings leftover burger and fries and being able to eat again 45 minutes later. now, i’m not hungry ever, i don’t eat lunch when i’m at school, i usually give it away so i don’t have to eat it, i can’t even finish one burger without stopping halfway and spitting it out and leaving it in the trash. i get random moments where i get really hungry, once a day, can hold my appetite through ONE meal only and other than that that’s all i’m eating. one meal a day MAYBE. i’ve never been focused on losing weight really, i’ve always had good metabolism so i haven’t worried about weight or needing to purge. i just can’t eat anymore, my appetite goes away the second i put food in my mouth, i have to spit it up, i refuse food, i give it away, i stay out of the kitchen now because food grosses me out now. i have been exercising a lot because it is just something to do but it isn’t because of my weight. my friends have asked me if anything is wrong but i don’t think there is. my life is going pretty good. 

i got a job three days ago, i’m back in school, got lots of new friends, my home life is good and everything. i don’t know how it would be stress related either. i’m just tired of food and don’t want to eat anymore. when i do eat i’m disgusted by it and spit it out. i’ve eaten one, ONE french fry and have a cookie in the past three days. ima tasting hydrated and drinking water but other than that i’m not taking in much. i’m worried because idk what’s causing this or how to get my appetite back. i’m not asking for medics help i’m just wondering if any one has ever had this happen and what you possibly did to help. thank you all ❤️❤️❤️",1566014066,8/16/2019 22:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/crh6kk/worried_that_im_becoming_anorexic_or_developing/,5

I got really nervous when I realized that there were no sizes below a size 0 and I wouldn't be able to find clothes that fit me. That is where I am at now and the size 0 is getting loose. I am trying everything in my power to eat, but it's so hard.

I realized that I would go days without eating. I am almost 34. Thinking about it, I realized that this behavior started about two years ago.How could this happen? I have never been really too concerned with my appearance and weight -- maybe that is why I have been so out of touch with it?

Please help me. I really need some advice.  


Edit: In response to some comments and to clarify. I find that I DO fear gaining the weight back. Even though I look at pictures of myself with 5 lbs more and I think I look better, I can't help but feel a great deal of satisfaction and congratulatory accomplishment at my willpower.   
While I wasn't fully conscious of it up to the point of size two, over the past 2 months I have come to note that my mental process enjoys the feeling of hunger, I find myself ignoring my hunger pains, and I find that my desire to eat goes away severely the more stress and discomfort I feel.",1565997197,8/16/2019 18:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cre3nb/developing_an_without_realizing_it/,24

1944,cr8uz4,Does anyone have any kind of health problems that make eating difficult?,"I don't have a diagnosis yet and whatever is wrong with me was more likely than not caused by restricting, but basically eating food is painful for me and my body often doesn't even process food properly which leaves me feeling tired no matter how much I eat. The more I eat the more pain I end up in and the less likely I am to actually absorb whatever food I consumed. I was pretty dedicated to getting back to a healthy weight earlier this year because I thought that I would feel better after, but it was really hard. I tried doing it very quickly at first by eating tons of calorie dense food and then I didn't gain anything. Eating slightly above maintenance worked for me and I eventually did gain the weight I wanted to. Unfortunately that didn't actually help me feel better and it was still enough food to cause pain. I was wondering if this is a common experience. At least something similar if not the exact same.

I've been kind of struggling with eating again since maintaining a healthy weight didn't fix my problems. I feel like it's way too easy to restrict now since I have a valid excuse to not eat as much. The AN mindset is kind of setting in again though which really sucks because I had other reasons to want to be at a healthy weight again, but they're not exactly present reasons. I feel really bad that I want to lose weight again. When I first started struggling with anorexia my goal weight was around where I am now which is barely underweight for someone of my height, but I didn't even know that it was underweight then. Now I just feel worse and I kind of want to go lower than I was when I decided to start working toward getting better. The only reason I decided to recover was because I hit my second goal weight and then immediately wanted to lose more which scared me because it made me realize I would just be stuck in a cycle if I never stopped. I was borderline ""severely thin"" then. Now I kind of have an excuse to keep going and I'm not really sure what to do. Some days I still feel like I should try to eat more to be healthy, but then I just get sick. If I keep eating less and less the way I have been I'll eventually be way too thin and it will make my health problems even worse. I don't know how to manage this.",1565973316,8/16/2019 11:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cr8uz4/does_anyone_have_any_kind_of_health_problems_that/,24

1948,cqxqrz,just needed to get this out...i'm sorry about the length,"(throwaway account because people in my life know my real username)

hey guys so it's my first time posting here but I really just need to vent to people who understand. I know I have a disordered relationship with food, but I'm not entirely sure that it's full blown anorexia as bad as some of the people on here and I've never seen a doctor for it. I just feel like absolute **trash** when I eat anything and I mostly hate eating around other people. School just started for me (I'm in my last year of high school) and it is really messing up my eating even more. 

I guess this all started about a year and a half ago when I was always nauseous due to most likely being depressed though never seeing a doctor about it (get ready that's going to be a common theme throughout this). I already had a low enough appetite, but I began to crave being hungry to get away from the constant nausea, and that led to me eating less and less and less. It then spiraled into me feeling like a slob after eating, but I could just ignore it for the most part. Slowly it's gotten worse and wrose, and it's particularly bad when I'm in sports. 

I run cross country for my school, and during those seasons I tend to eat less so that I can feel ""lighter"" and like a better runner, because all of the fast ones seem to be skinny and graceful and light. This causes me to get injured quite a lot, and I in fact just had a scare where I thought I had a second stress fracture in 3 years. I also wrestle. If anyone has any kind of background with this sport, you know that cutting weight is a big way to stay in a competitive weight class all season. At the beginning of wrestling, I was actually gaining weight because I was coming home exhausted and starving, causing me to eat and actually gain muscle. I was in the best shape of my life. However, as the end of the season rolled around and I was expected to wrestle in the lightweight bracket at sectionals and state, so I had to cut a bit of weight to do so. I don't even know if I need to explain the effects of that to a bunch of people who know probably exactly what I'm talking about. Obviously, I suddenly went all out starving myself and I was back to square one. 

My boyfriend knows about this whole problem and has been nothing but amazing about it but I feel horrible ranting to him about it all the time because he gets really concerned. The same goes with my friends. Most (all but one) of them don't know the full extent of the problem but know I don't eat enough and get genuinely concerned as well. I hate when this attracts attention, too. I just want to be able to eat lunch at school and snack when I want to without feeling like I'm the fattest person alive all the freaking time. 

If you're still reading at this point, I went to this subreddit specifically because of some things that happened today that really caused me to stop and think. I went out to breakfast this morning with my friends before school (we had late start today) and I ate a plate of hash browns and had a cup of coffee. I have had some problems with coffee in the past, but I still consistently use it as an appetite suppressor because drinking my calories is a lot better for me mentally than eating them. Anyway, about an hour after breakfast, I started to ""get the caffeine shits,"" as I like to say, and I felt nauseous and just generally not good. I usually don't eat at school, but I definitely did not want to eat today. I was joking around about ""the shits"" with my boyfriend and how I didn't feel good and he got all worried about me. I felt horrible because we are actually so close but I don't want to make him my personal therapist because he just simply doesn't deserve that. He knows how badly I react to caffeine and was just a little worried. That was the first strike for me today. The second came while I was riding an excersie bike with my friend at cross country practice (you guessed it... I'm injured) and I remarked that I was dizzy, not thinking too much about it. She asked what I had ate and I told her. She kind of seemed horrified. I guess I always downplay it in my mind because I've done worse in the past so I didn't see the big deal. These events just got me to thinking how bad I've gotten again and how angry I am at myself for uneededly worrying those around me. I'm kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place because I don't think I am bad enough to need help but I don't want to get any worse. Can anyone help me?

1971,cwch2o,Is this similar to any of your experiences with an ED?,"Tw/vent abt ED and PTSD


So I have an ED and I think it got worse after I developed severe PTSD. My abuser was/is very obese. That influenced my ED greatly I feel like. A solid amount of my ED stems around the idea of being the complete opposite of him as much as possible. My biggest fear is being even slightly like him so I don’t eat and when I do most of the time I will purge it. I was recovering and after I left the treatment facility I gained weight rapidly from binging and I’ve relapsed pretty badly into my old habits because I saw my weight go up about 100 lbs more than when I started treatment. I wish I were joking when I say I gained 100 lbs but it sadly is true. I’ve now lost almost 30 lbs since two or three months ago and I keep seeing the weight shed off but I still feel like being at my weight makes me closer to him and it terrifies me because I would never want to be like him at all or hurt anyone like he hurt me and i feel like if I do become the size he is I’ll be like him. I’m just so so so scared I might be anything like him at all. I dress the opposite of how he would dress i made my hair as different as possible to not have the same hair I had then or the same hair as him. I don’t wear the clothes I used to because if both weight and even seeing them causes great flashbacks. So I feel like my PTSD really influences my eating disorder greatly causing me to avoid eating as much as possible and only consuming calories when needed from liquids as to never gain food weight. None of my friends or family know I’m relapsing and I don’t want to tell them and worry them so I’ve kept up my recovery blog but it’s full of lies. I’m just wondering, do any of you with PTSD and ED’s together feel your PTSD feeds into your ED?

1984,cvo45s,Can I even recover???,"Hi! Okay so I have been struggling with eating (restricting &amp; purging) for 6 years. &amp; I must suck at it because I just became medically underweight this year. I’ve always been right at the “healthy” line. So basically I restrict for like six months. Then binge for two. Gain weight. Restrict again. &amp; cycle through. Every time I restrict I hit a new lowest weight &amp; it gets worse &amp; I get better at it. &amp; I love it... until I start to feel my brain deteriorating &amp; I get anxiety 24/7 &amp; I can’t do simple tasks like count money or have a conversation. I can’t even push a shopping cart without both hands because it’s too heavy. Lol. 

Anyways.. I’m at the point (yet again) where I’m sick of the all the fucking side effects that “starving” comes with. 
Well here’s the catch.. I don’t feel hunger anymore. I havnt had a healthy relationship with the feeling in years. I eat yogurt or 3 crackers &amp; feel sick all day long. But if I don’t eat I feel like I’ve been poisoned. I want to be happy. I think I can just eat 700-900 calories a day &amp; call myself recovered. I ate around 800 for the first time in a while yesterday &amp; I just feel so sick. At this point I feel more guilty for starving myself. But it’s like it’s the only option. &amp; to me it’s not even starving. I don’t even know what starving means.. 
but I do know it’s worse then ever. &amp; I know it will always progress &amp; get worse &amp; worse. But I still see fat. Food still makes me ill. It’s a catch 22 &amp; logically I know it will be okay but I can’t convince myself of that. I see girls that I know I’m way skinnier then but I somehow think I’m fatter then?? It’s so fucked. I don’t know what I look like. I don’t know where to start. I don’t know what to do.

1986,cvlzqz,Guilt,"I didn't know where else to post this, so sorry if it doesn't belong.

 I don't have an eating disorder or any history of disordered eating. A little backstory, I am a 21F and I have bipolar type 1, and I was put on a medication two years ago that made me gain 64 pounds in 2 months. I am 5'2, and normally around 105 to 110, and my self image was shattered. I recently went off this medication and I have already lost 12 pounds just by being off of it. 

I have really been struggling with guilt after eating. I don't eat a whole lot. I start feeling terrible about myself, and get paranoid I am going to gain all of my weight back. I begin thinking of ways I can compensate, like ""maybe tomorrow I won't eat as much to make up for today"", or ""maybe I will exercise more to burn all of the calories I just ate"". I start to hate myself and feel like a terrible person just for eating normally and it starts this cycle of self loathing of feeling fat. I don't overeat at all. Which is why I am so confused over the guilt.

I LOVE food, but recently I've been scared of eating because I hate feeling bad afterwards. I have a therapist who I love, and I go to DBT every week, but I'm scared to bring it up with my therapist. I'm the happiest I have been in years. I just started a job I love, and I'm finally making plans. I just don't want my therapist to think ""oh, there is ALWAYS something wrong going on."" I really am doing good, I'm just trying to understand this guilt I am feeling, and the compulsive need to not eat or exercise to avoid that feeling. 

I was just wondering if anyone had any insight.",1566813819,8/26/2019 5:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cvlzqz/guilt/,1
1987,cvjxc7,Do you avoid having mirrors in your house?,"Hi everyone, 

(Posted with mod approval).

I'm writing an article for the Guardian newspaper which is about people who live without mirrors in their houses - perhaps because they have BDD, are in recovery for an eating disorder, or have other anxiety disorders. 

I'm looking to speak with UK based case studies predominantly about what this is like: whether it is beneficial or damaging for your mental health, and what the consequences may be for your interpersonal relationships. 

Happy to provide evidence of my press credentials (if you'd like to Google me, my name is Sirin Kale.) I have form in reporting sensitive issues in an educational and compassionate way, without sensationalism.

Thanks Sirin",1566798339,8/26/2019 0:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cvjxc7/do_you_avoid_having_mirrors_in_your_house/,1
1988,cvjowi,Why Am I Like This?,"Were there early signs? Behaviors that predicted a future toxic relationship with food? Is it a genetic predisposition? Can I blame someone? Is it a coping mechanism to try to control the anxiety? My mom has bpd and bipolar as well as OCD...she was/is very emotionally and physically abusive. Maybe my traumatic childhood caused this. Is the ED just a side effect from the abuse?

My sister and mom would call me ""gentle giant"" because I used to be in fencing, gymnastics, and rock climbing (sports that bulked up my muscles). Have you guys seen ""That Regular Show""? Its a cartoon. Do you know who Muscle Man is? They would call me Muscle Man. One time, I was sitting on the floor, in a child's pose, doing my homework and my sister for no reason at all came up behind me and picked me up by my love handles--side fat. It hurt so bad.

My dad used to make \*moo\*-ing noises every time I opened the fridge and would give me shit for eating whatever I wanted. Ironically he still gives me shit butt now for not eating anything. I'm never going to be enough. I'm nothing so I should eat nothing... it never really is enough. I get perfect grades...straight A's, full IB, honor roll, but it's still not enough. I'm still a disappointment. My mom has told me to kill myself and that I'm a fucking waste of space and someone else's resources. If I kill myself make sure I actually do i because attempts are for attention seekers is what she tells me.

My aunt who is a Dr is anorexic. She said if you want to lose weight just shut your mouth. Over the summer of Jr year of high school (three years ago), before my ED, she would tell me things like I was fat. She and her husband are divorced and saying it was toxic relationship is an understatement. Apparently, she had found his porn stash and she was mad that she didn't do it for him... When she was explaining it she said that he had a DVD of cheerleaders, young girls like me, on it doing inappropriate sexual things. My cousin screams ""Ewww no! NOT LIKE HER!! She's fat!!"" and just started laughing hysterically. His mom started laughing too and was like ""I meant not like her but I meant around the same age. Girls who are skinnier."" They bullied me the entire summer and the next one as well. I thought it didn't get to me...at one point it was like a middle finger to them both like I'll show you...the next time you see me I'll be a toothpick...and then the next summer I'll be dead. It's your fault.

Is it because of my ADHD? I take 54mg of Ritalin which is the highest dosage. I've always been on it though since elementary school and haven't had a real problem. I did have problems eating in front of people but that was an anxiety thing and fear of judgement. I also just found chewing to be gross and the sounds of it. I think chewing is gross and I judge people when they eat so I just assumed people thought I was gross too when I atet so I never ate at school, but I would still eat. I just waited till I got home to eat lunch. I remember being hungry, I remember what it was like to feel satisfied after a meal and liking and enjoying the taste of food was like, I used to be adventurous with food, and it excited me, but now I just hate food and trying new things. When I do eat I just hate it...I get nothing out of it, nothing from it. I'm going through the motions of eating, but not experiencing it. To me, food is like if I was chewing on cardboard for a couple hours, just pointless and meh. Doesn't taste bad but its not good. I over work out because I need to be constantly stimulated and my serotonin levels are so low that when I do run for like 14miles on empty it gives me this serotonin high. That has messed me up so much though, because the only true happiness I get (besides cuddling my puppies) is from starving and over exerting. Can my indifference and lack of feeling be due to my depression? I'm on prozac now which has helped with suicide but it hasn't made me any happier.

I don't know who I am. The more I keep trying to dive for answers the more I keep getting lost. My therapist keeps opening old scars and replaying horrific child hood traumas.  I'm trying to forgive my mom and dad and myself as well but I'm finding it difficult when I have to see and live with my abusers every day. It's like being in cycle of beginning to  heal but just as I'm feeling mildly better I get triggered again and again and again. If I had dealt with my emotions earlier...instead of surprising them because I was raised in an environment where feelings and emotions weren't allows to be expressed. Home wasn't a safe place. If I had actually admitted to the abuse and tried to talk about all these suppressed emotions and memories...would I still have an ED? The more I try to get better...the more mental health similarities I'm finding with my mom. My ultimate fear that I've always had was being like my mom--a monster, being out of control of my actions due to chemical imbalances. Maybe this is who I am and its in my genetics to be fucked up. Maybe its inevitable.

My grandma whom I was very close to died of acute leukemia. I found out my senior year of high school and thats when my ED kicked into overdrive. I didn't feel a sense of lose...just that I had to burn off cals. I hated myself even more because here I was burning negative cals at the gym when my grandma was in agony. I never got to say goodbye. She died two months after we found out. I had the chance to call her while she was in the hospital but I couldn't bring myself to do it. The day she died was when I was at my ex boyfriends house trying to lose my virginity. Did I cause her death? Because I wasn't praying for her instead I was trying to get fucked? I still can't believe she's gone and when I was at my lowest...I was forced to recover. Without my coping mechanism...without that something to obsess on..I was forced to feel and I can't feel I don't want to feel. I need to be empty! I need to be numb and to feel nothing or I will feel everything--all the emotions I've held back all at once.

Does it really get better?

I don't have anyone to blame but myself. I did this to myself...no one else.",1566796680,8/26/2019 0:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cvjowi/why_am_i_like_this/,0

1992,cvj25r,Calorie Counting Gave Me Brain Damage!,"For the past few months I've been faking recovery. Reporting what I eat on a sheet to my parents, one that does not have cals or nutrition facts but is purely for accountability and making sure I'm eating three times a day. I naturally bull shit everything on it and I keep a secret log of my actual intake. 

My parents have been getting really emotionally dicy. Somedays they will try to be understanding and sensitive, but most days they victim blame me and blame my ED on why our family is so dysfunctional. This particular incident, my Dr yelled at my dad for being a prick and so he felt guilt about it i guess. So we went on a spontaneous three day vacation to California. I dictated the destinations and what we were going to do. I was indifferent about the whole thing so they suggested Six Flags because once upon a time, a whole ED light yr ago, that place made me ""happy."" The whole trip was a wash. I knew going into it that I was going to get shit for not eating...I tried to tell my mom that I didn't want to go because dad was going to be rude and insensitive/triggering but to no avail. 

Long story short, he found my journal and was upset. Especially since I was logging in an average of 0-96cals a day. He yelled at me how like I need to eat more and what I'm eating is't enough and I had to explain like to him that it's not a lot for him but to me a person with an ED it is very hard and a lot of food for me. I'm at least trying. He's like you're not even eating enough to maintain, at this rate your weight will keep going down and down. I'm not a grown man in my 40's I don't need to eat 2,000+ cals a day like chill. Plus he's not my Dr. he's not my nutritionist like he needs to stop forcing me to eat and triggering me. 

Sometime I will order like a salad and he pressures me to order something else with it because its ""not enough."" Or I get an appetizer and he's demands I get a normal portion as if I'm not just going ""save it for later."" 

Anyways, on the trip, he convinced me to try this Vegan and gluten free dessert place. I let him get inside my head. I ate a bite size vanilla bean cupcake with pink frosting, 1/5th of a matcha chocolate square, and 1/3 of a cashew caramel bar....there weren't any nutrition facts for it anywhere....and I was pisssssed, beyond livid. 

This quickly escalates around dinner time. This meltdown thats mentioned from the title of this post happened towards the end of our trip and I was so mad that I didn't want to get crab legs anymore. I was screaming I'm not hungry I'll just eat at the airport or whatever. When we got there I  ordered veggie rolls at this asian place thinking it was a spring roll--nope. It was an egg roll covered in grease like I mean more grease than pizza...the grease was legitimately soaking through the . box. I flipped out and refused to eat it and . so I opted for a salad that basically had spinach, iceberg, red . quinoa, tomatoes, and black olives....I started hyper ventilating because my dad made me eat all of it. It was prepackaged and so I thought there was nutrition on facts on the bottom of the container but there were not. I made my dad help me look up salads that were close in calories and he was getting hella annoyed. 

He found this one salad that had parmesan cheese added to the cals as well as croutons and dressing which upped the values, but a this point its been hours so I'm like whatever its fine. Then my dad is like no its not fine, this is a gross overestimate of what you ate and it wouldn't be accurate. Then I flipped out and went nutzo. I snapped. I was like this entire journal is inaccurate because of you! For the past three days I've been estimating because I just don't know! I don't know how much cals I've eaten or carbs are anything! I don't know anything! I only eat foods that I definitely know the caloric values of.

He told me to calm down as if I was causing a scene...as if I was just being another hysterical woman and that he can slap me down into submission. 

Then he told me that i cant expect . everyone to cater to me and blah blah and how I shouldn't let this prevent me from living and eating what I want and blah about how even though I don't know the exact cal amount I can find a pretty close food item that is similar. But like....if I don't track cals  i can't have accountability. I can't track in my head...visually three potatoes seems not that much and sounds heavenly but if I sat down and wrote out the carbs in it and all the cals...its bad bad news.

2004,cv0hfq,Question about mukbangs,"i'm not shore if this needs a TW but i'm putting one anyway just to be safe.

&amp;#x200B;

context about me. i used to overeat, a lot, but i started changing that when i was younger  (unfortunately i was pro ana when i was younger), now its gotten to the point i am developing another eating disorder similar to ana, but im still overweight, so im in an area where i need to louse weight, and not further develop my ed.

&amp;#x200B;

I've herd that mukbangs can both help people who don't eat enough, and help people who eat too much, so i want to know what people with eds think, because if they do have a bad effect on people with eds i want everyone to be aware so they don't go down a similar path.

&amp;#x200B;

do you find muckbangs trigger you to eat, or help you not eat?

also do you watch them regulatory for recovery, or do you watch them because they trigger your ED?

I don’t like myself. I am absolutely convinced that I am fat despite the fact that people are telling me I am thin. 

I started regretting every single bite and that’s why I just stopped eating. Hunger makes me feel beautiful. I am obsessed with losing weight. I am thinking about this every minute.

I don’t want it to be like this but I like seeing myself getting skinnier. It’s so confused. I just can’t eat. Like literally. One bite and everything gets worse. I even feel that I should vomit. 

I saw my friends eating a cake and I started crying because of the food. It disgusts me. I feel dizzy all the time. I got some spots on the skin. I like seeing my bones coming out. 

What is happening with my mind? My friends are telling me that something is wrong and I don’t want to tell my doctors cuz they will make me eat. Something that I hate.

Thank you in advance.",1567623966,9/4/2019 14:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/czp9xq/eating_problem/,10
2044,czp0jl,Booked a Doctors Appointment - Advice please ;_;,"Hi! So after months of feeling scared to I will be opening up to my doctor about my eating issues  behind my parents back - hopefully they will keep it all confidential. But i’m scared, what if he thinks i’m not sick enough?

I wanted to ask you guys:
How did your first appointments go, as in when you first mentioned to your doc that you have disordered eating? 

and more importantly - how did they diagnose you? was it a long process? did it take several appointments?

Especially interested if you live in the UK like me as we have the same health care system but anyones experiences are welcome! im curious!",1567622819,9/4/2019 13:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/czp0jl/booked_a_doctors_appointment_advice_please/,9
2045,cziea1,Possible TW- can’t seem to end this binge eating starve cycle,"I’ve been struggling with the binge eat, gain weight, then starve and lose it all cycle for years and years. I starve and become too thin and people worry, and then suddenly I spend one night binging and it’s all I do for the next 3 weeks, or months. I don’t understand how no one has noticed this cycle of me being thin and then a little chubby over and over. My eating habits have been severely disordered since I was 14, I am almost 21 now. When I was 13 I was put into a residential treatment center for a year which is where my disorder really developed. I don’t think the staff there were fully equipped to know how to deal with this and it just got worse when I left. There response was just to force me to eat 100% of every meal and they were often very large. I heavily abused laxatives from 15-16, was always a little underweight as a teen and the past 2 years have just been an endless cycle of binge then starve. I feel so lost in this, I’ll binge and binge until my stomach literally looks 6 months pregnant and I cannot move. I don’t know how to reach out and let people know this is bigger than it may appear. I’m suffering so much and I know my body is too, constantly going from one extreme to the other. I also deal with Irritable bowel syndrome so when I force my body to take in mass amounts of foods it doesn’t like I become very sick, but that doesn’t stop me. 

I’ve also had two serious boyfriends who also dealt with eating disorders(bulimia) and I can’t imagine that has helped me.  I never feel happy with my body either way. I finally told my mom a few months ago how bad this was when I had lost a large amount of weight after a painful breakup, and I’m on a waitlist at a treatment facility for outpatient therapy, but I don’t know if I can wait. I’ve since gained the weight back and probably plus some. I’m currently in the binge part of the cycle but I know soon I’ll break down and the starving will return. I feel hopeless in this ☹️ Anyone been able to successfully get out of this? What has worked best for you?",1567588432,9/4/2019 4:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cziea1/possible_tw_cant_seem_to_end_this_binge_eating/,1
2046,czfd8t,My friend told someone,"So I have known my friend, A for a little over a year. She's my best friend. I've told her pretty much everything. I haven't said anything to my parents, but I believe I am anorexic. A is too, and she kind of nudged me to tell her after about 6-8 months of friendship. She could tell the weird eating patterns etc .

I haven't said this, but A makes my ED worse. She triggers me and idek. That's not really important. But she's trying to recover and I'm not.

Anyway, the new school year started for us, and I don't have many classes so I'm not at school very often. A met someone new, C. She's in the grade below us and A found out that C also has AN. She was in inpatient for 8 months etc. etc. But A told C about me too.

I'm really freaking mad about it, like A knows that she's the only one I've told. And she knows it took me over half of our friendship before I told her. And I didn't want to tell her in the first place, she kinda forced me to. It was my problem to tell, and she told someone I've never met. Idk

Would I be in the wrong to say something to A? I feel like it's pointless bc C already knows. It's not really helping. I'm just really hurt I guess. And A has all sorts of mental health issues and I don't want to make anything worse for her.",1567567332,9/3/2019 22:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/czfd8t/my_friend_told_someone/,4

2049,cz9pi6,I never want wear a shirt ever again,I’ve been ashamed of showing my body off and on my entire life. It’s been seven years since I’ve been shirtless around anyone. I truly love swimming it’s always been a passion of mine. I haven’t swam in seven years. It got so bad that even wearing a rash guard to the pool wasn’t enough. The thought of the rash guard briefly riding up and exposing any part of me frightened me so acutely that I simply never did it again. Every time I look in the mirror I it causes me  such emotional trauma that it almost hurts physically. I hate my body so much the only time I take my shirt off is the shower and it’s the worst. I’m 6 foot tall guy and I’m 10 pounds away from my goal weight 140. The worst part about it is I know i’ll still be miserable when I get to it. I actually don’t know how much weight I would have to lose to be actually happy. I know I’d be drastically underweight before I could  even look at the person in the mirror let alone be happy and I’ve given given up even romancing the idea of ever viewing myself as being handsome. Recently I met a girl online I could tell she was really into me. The first time I took my shirt off in front of her I immediately put her hands and the places I knew it would hurt the most for her to touch. She laughed when I told her how bad it made me feel. She pinched the area I felt most vulnerable and said it was just skin. I knew in my head technically she was wrong that there was in fat that there. I viewed what she said as lie but I desperately wanted to believe it. for a long time after that I still felt God awful having my shirt off around her. It still hurts so much to look down. It felt even worse when I felt my skin roll up in touch. The times I was shirtless with her I accidentally looked down a several times I saw what I call my fat sag bunch up it was sickening and it hurt me every time. I got to the point where I was ok around her shirtless but only while standing. I was still uncomfortable but I could manage it. Leaning over is still too much to bear. Specialty looking down in a compromised position. One day I was undressing for a shower and after I did I realized I’d left something in the other room. So I got dressed but as I was holding my shirt in my hands I had a lazy hesitation pausing I think if I really cared enough to get what was in the other room. I decided I needed to get it In that time I flirted with the idea going out shirtless and  not putting the shirt over my head. I did it I walked through my house got what I needed without being seen. Strangely I was very disappointed no one saw. I walking back my grandma saw me she spoke to me and stopped to talk to her. I was happy and felt lucky that someone had noticed me shirtless it made me feel excited. I realized just how powerful being shirtless around people makes me feel. Mockingly crushing my greatest fear almost made me feel godly. I wish it was more normal to be shirtless in public. I’m by no means athletically built but I recognize now that I’m attractive even if my current weight. Last night I was sleep deprived and had a very strong urge to get something I needed from my car wearing nothing but my underwear but maybe that would’ve made me feel a little bit too powerful you know?,1567539548,9/3/2019 14:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cz9pi6/i_never_want_wear_a_shirt_ever_again/,1

2054,cz7j1t,How do you deal with family (or friends) than don’t eat as much as you are supposed to ?,"Have regained most of the weight as an in-patient, been supposed to gain a bit more for a few months now but stagnating a bit. On holiday with parents and sister atm, and am really struggling with the fact that they eat really little. + all very skinny. This makes menstress, restrict my intake, and makes me mad that they don’t acknowledge the fact that this is difficult for me. I’m really doing better, am at a normal weight and don’t really have problems with my appearance or feeling full. But as my family is really fucked up (lots of fights, mother with dementia...), it makes me very anxious and it provokes anorexic thoughts. So the fact that they are never really hungry, or don’t mind eating at regular times makes it worse. I just end up obsessing over the fucked up aim to eat less than others (which I don’t really manage anyway), the anger that they don’t try to make me confortable and asking myself if my entourage (rn, my sister) doesn’t have anorexic behaviors (she really never did and has always been thin, very different body type from mine so no comparison possible either).
I just don’t know how to let go off all these thoughts that really are nearly inexistant usually but just come back with them (or sometimes similar situations with friends). Am I right to be a bit mad ? Is it just a proof I’m so far from being done with anorexia ?

2091,cxui27,Am I relapsing or is it ok to lose weight in recovery?,"I've been in recovery for over three years now, and I realized I'd gained a significant amount of weight beyond what I used to be before the ED. It was really upsetting for me to realize, and some ED behaviors became triggered as a result. With my therapist's help I was able to sort of stay on the recovery track anyway, by making sure to eat regularly. However, I started counting calories and have begun to lose quite a lot of weight. I'm still at a very healthy weight and I am eating my meals. It's just that I'm worried that this could go beyond just a little weight loss. My plan is to reach only a certain weight that is well within the healthy range and maintain there by using calorie counting. Counting (in my mind) will help me to both lose and maintain my weight because I can be more aware of if I'm eating enough or too little.

Do you think this is a relapse? Or, is it possible to lose some weight in recovery and then maintain that healthy weight?

I realize that engaging in dieting behavior is basically relapsing, but if my plan is to only get to a certain number and stay there is it really a relapse? (I guess there's the possibility that I could get to that weight and still want to lose more.)",1567247617,8/31/2019 5:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cxui27/am_i_relapsing_or_is_it_ok_to_lose_weight_in/,5
2092,cxtwxo,Lost and Confused,"Hi everyone,
New here. As the title suggests I am lost with the whole ordeal of this issue. I was overweight and lost the amount to be in a healthy BMI in about 4-6 months. I am 23 and always had good eating habits and didn’t care about physical attributes. For the entire year (weight loss was the end of 2018) I had disordered eating by restricting meals and at times only had one meal that was low in calories, I also over exercised. I have always been well aware of how bad this is, so I have spoken to my GP this week, and to paraphrase she says it isn’t good and need to focus on protein (especially as I’m vegetarian) . It’s surprising I haven’t gotten sick all year (particularly with my genetic heart disease) and I’m still at healthy weight. I have then spoken to a nutritionist (2nd time) and psychologist. I have a meal guideline and the psychologist think it’s all early stages and I need to think critically about eating food (‘energy fuels the brain’).  I am wondering if there’s any tips to not let this spiral out of control even further? Basically the heath professionals said they can’t do anything because it’s up to me, and the psychologist had said what I just wrote, so it left me in a bit of a spin, I think I’m harder to convince because I come from a psychology  background (ironic). However, I would love to hear how others overcame their own challenges. and if there’s anything that I could try.

I made an appointment with a new doctor to basically just get a checkup and to get my levels done (I know I used to be deficient in a few areas but I don't know if I still am).

My question is how can I talk to him about my health openly without just being told to eat more? I know that already. I'm working openly and honestly with my therapist, but for now I want to talk about what I can do to help my body while I'm dealing with relapse.

How would you approach this? I was thinking I would just come clean right off the bat and tell him how much I'm consuming but that I'm being monitored by a therapist, and that I want to know if there's anything else I can do for myself right now.

I'm worried about being yelled at or lectured or made to be more scared than I need to be. I'm in kind of a fragile mental state lately and the last thing I need is an insensitive physician berating me for ruining my life.

I started to get help for a completely different psychological **disorder** (GAD) and I just realized that now with my pills...I feel happier, I feel calmer, I feel better altogether. I didn't even notice the changed view of my Body at first. Yesterday **I felt Beautiful** for the first time in 6 years. I am able to eat without guilt crushing my throat shut. I am so much better.

So just to be like all These inspirational dudes and dudines: No matter how badly sick you are. No matter how many disorders you suffer from. **It can get better**. For everyone. I truly believe that.

I know that it doesn't feel like there's any Chance of healing at all, sometimes. Not even in the slightest.

I felt so depressed as my anxiety got worse and as it got worse so did my ED...but I got help.

I know that I still have a lot of work to do on my GAD, but **loosing my sucky relationship with my Body** in Exchange for self love and self respect is one step towards my Dream of Living as a mentally stable Citizen.

2104,cxejw5,I fully relapsed again,"My anorexia started in a mental hospital 2 years ago, I was admitted mostly for persistent depressive disorder and self harm, I felt like I had no control and freedom over anything, there was quite a lot of people with eating disorders and I thought, hey why not try that, and it made me feel ecstatic, the nurses didn't control my food intake because I wasn't admitted for an eating disorder and my mum told them that I had no problem with food during admission so it was pretty easy to get away with it. I was in the hospital for three and a half months and was sent home in February and I continued restricting until July of the same year. 

Then I managed to recover on my own, because life was going semi-well I have had thought about relapsing for the entire time of recovery but I never acted upon them because again there was little to no need to take control, I already had it. That changed this month I suppose, my life now revolves around my sick grandparents, circling around grandma in the hospital with a shattered foot and senile grandpa at home, I also had to get a job because our family income is pretty low and outcome high because of this situation.

It started slow, eating less, skipping a meal and such but now I'm back to eating between 800 and 300 calories a day and I know it's not healthy but I just can't get myself to stop. I know it's just gonna ruin my life again with the obsessing over calories and scales and exercise, and it doesn't even feel good anymore but I want to feel at least a little bit of control.",1567157423,8/30/2019 4:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cxejw5/i_fully_relapsed_again/,0

My incredible, strong, wonderful friend is struggling with severe restriction currently. Her dietician won’t increase her meal plan due to fear of refeeding syndrome. And the dietician wants her to go to acute. She is very resistant to this idea having done it many times in the past and it being unsuccessful. The only other option is to weight restore in a hospital setting rather than acute. But with such a large chance of refeeding she needs to be at a hospital that is well equipped to handle this. Does anyone have any experience with hospitals that are not in Colorado that are equipped to deal with severe restriction.

But to be honest, 90% of the time I’m under 300 (and half of that is from the energy drink I chug on my way to work every morning). The days I get close to 800 are the days I have to see family or friends (I don’t need their comments or judgements) and eating that much makes me physically sick, every bite I struggle to swallow.

Besides my energy drink, I have no craving for food. Ever. I’m just beginning to realize I may have an eating disorder but I don’t really know what to do. 

I only stopped eating after moving myself out of an abusive relationship/home. It was horrible. My ex physically assaulted me and my mom the day I tried to move my stuff out (all of my belongings were destroyed too) and I had to get a restraining order. This has led to my depression getting much more severe.

So to get to the point.

2126,d2uom9,My husband has been triggering me.,"The trigger warning is because I don't know if this still trigger anyone else. 

I think my situation may be a little different.  I have depression and anxiety from PTSD, and it caused me to lose my appetite.  There was nothing I wanted to eat.  I was actually a good, healthy weight and the weight loss was kind of alarming.  I stopped losing weight but I can still eat only a few things and not very much. 

My husband grew up in one of those families where wasting food is a cardinal sin.  By my calculation, over 12 years of marriage he's pointed out at least 100 times that I tend not to eat leftovers.  One of us would cook something, and then we'd put the rest in the refrigerator.  And sometimes I didn't want it again. 

Since I came out about my ED I've asked him to stop commenting on my eating habits, or lack thereof.  But last week he was like, ""you don't eat leftovers"" again. 

Then there's the cream cheese that was in the refrigerator for months.  I think I needed some for a recipe and bought an extra one.  Anyway he kept asking me when I was going to do something with the cream cheese. We were grocery shopping this weekend and I actually had anxiety while passing the cream cheese because I thought he was going to nag me about it again.  He didn't, but when we got home I threw the ****ing cream cheese in the trash and it felt very liberating. 

But I wonder whether it's better just not to eat than to risk eating ""wrong.""",1568226698,9/11/2019 13:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/d2uom9/my_husband_has_been_triggering_me/,2

I had suspected that my girlfriend who lives in another country (yes a long distance relationship we met eachother irl for the first time last summer) has an ED. She got mad at me for constantly bothering her about how she shouldn't count calories and that they literally mean nothing and if she actually wants to lose weight she should just eat a normal diet and exercise. In the past she has had problems with binge eating and comfort eating. And at times did have short periods like a week when she apparently would starve herself. Already sounds horrible doesn't it... But me a recovering anorexic didn't want to believe it..I shut my eyes from it and when she visited me everything seemed to be just fine.. Now after two months i finally got her to confess.. I told her about OSFED and she started crying.. For 3 hours we talked about it and she is going to a doctor because her grandmother was really really worried.. And for good reason.. She has lost a lot of weight in a month that she ate close to nothing.. I saw the warning signs and tried to warn her.. But of course at that point just warning someone doesn't really help.. Her own grandmother who doesn't know any English tried to literally tell me with hand signs about her behavior.

So yeah... I don't know if I can handle this.. We have both had problems with cutting and both have depression and apparently now both have an ED..",1568089366,9/9/2019 23:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/d22ldk/my_girlfriend_has_an_eating_disorder_as_well/,0

2168,d1evu8,Finally admitting I have a problem,"Hi, I’m new to this sub, but not new to struggling with eating. I’ve been through many bouts of over and under-eating throughout my life. I’m 34 and I first noticed about ten years ago when my ex husband left me that the despair of the situation made me completely lose my appetite. I also lost significant weight. I basically lived on slim fast shakes, kidney beans, carrots and blueberries. When I met my current husband he would insist I eat more and made kind of a big deal about it. And I did get a lot better, I would say to the point that I had no issues eating at all and actually started to love cooking and eating pretty much any and all things. Well about two years ago I began to accept that I was remembering repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse. I spoke out about it to my parents and brother in an effort to begin healing. My relationships with them have totally fallen apart, and I’ve discovered that my mother is a covert narcissist and has been psychologically manipulating and abusing me my whole life. This is devastating because pretty much since I was a teenager I’ve always considered my mom to be my best friend and now I have gone completely no contact to protect myself and my two daughters from more abuse. I am trying desperately to heal and learn how to cope with all of this trauma, am even finally seeing a psychologist(yay), but the eating issue is out of control. I hate food, I hate eating. Even the smell or thought of food makes me nauseous. I have to force myself to eat and it’s so sickening and upsetting. I am even beginning to hate consuming liquids as well which has been my one saving grace in a lot of ways. I know its psychosomatic, but honestly I don’t care about my weight or calories or anything like that, I mean I care but in a normal way or whatever, like I’m not obsessed about it. I also get most of my calories from alcohol, my preference is beer, but sometimes wine. I wouldn’t say that I abuse alcohol, but it’s a crutch for me. It helps me relax and feel good which nothing else really does and it also will sometimes help me to get a little bit of an appetite. But now that is waning as well. I don’t know what this issue is rooted in but it’s getting really bad and I’m struggling with it constantly. I am going to talk to my therapist about it at the next appointment, I honestly got so overwhelmed at my first one that I forgot to mention it. Or maybe I wasn’t ready because it’s definitely embarrassing to me. I feel so ashamed and confused.

2175,d13i6l,I think I chose this,"Last year I was a junior in college and really struggled with my weight, and constantly feeling anxious about eating more than 800-900 calories a day. I lost around 25 pounds in this time, and would sometimes stand in the kitchen and do jumping jacks or sit ups to burn off extra calories or before I let myself eat. I felt really out of control. I had a therapist at the time for other unrelated  things I had been dealing with, and we came up with a plan and talked a lot about it. I got back to eating pretty normally, though i did still skip meals here and there in order to cut calories. It took me a long time to stop worrying about or counting my calories. 
I gained most of the weight back and wasn’t happy, but felt that it wasn’t as big of a deal as I felt it was before.

Well—school just started again, and I am really right back at counting my calories, and restricting, and feeling uncomfortable if I’m not hungry. I am terrified of what I’m doing to my body, but I am TERRIFIED of gaining weight. I want to be skinny.

I don’t know what to do, because my therapist does not specialize in eating disorders, and I don’t know how to find someone that does without my parents finding out. 

Also—I feel really guilty because sometimes this almost feels like a choice. I knew if I let myself start restricting again I would become obsessed with it, but I almost wanted that to happen. I wanted to feel obsessed. I feel selfish and terrible that I pretty much chose this and brought this on myself.

2183,d0tdj1,My outpatient assessment destroyed me,"** TW: Suicide, BMI &amp; weight mention **

After 6 agonizing months of waiting, I finally got a call two weeks ago saying that my referral to an outpatient eating disorder treatment centre was accepted and that I would have an evaluation for treatment. I was super anxious but pretty stoked about finally getting my evaluation done and hopefully back on track on the recovery train. Everything seemed to be going well until the interviewer made a comment about me “not really meeting the criteria for the program.” She didn’t elaborate why but said I could still do the program and classes if I felt they would help. Anyways, I’m absolutely crushed. It feels like I’ve been told I’m “not sick enough.” I dealt with an eating disorder throughout my teen years and thought I had it beat but it came back about a year ago with a vengeance and has pretty much ruined my life. I’m the lowest weight I’ve ever been and currently my bmi is sitting at the 17.7 range. I feel absolutely defeated and hopeless, I don’t think I’m going to go back, and am seriously thinking about ending it. I can’t live like this.",1567843877,9/7/2019 3:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/d0tdj1/my_outpatient_assessment_destroyed_me/,4

I am in a job where I have to remain in weight standards, so I cant get too thin, but I have now decided to not eat this weekend despite having a weigh in.

2190,d0pdbj,Period Questions:,"I have some questions about periods. When I first started to lose weight, I lost my period. Even when I had dropped just a few pounds,my period was gone. When I was anorexic, I also didn’t have my period. After my blood tests came in, it was due to hormones. 

I then had to gain weight. No matter how much I gained, my period didn’t come back until I was my pre-Ed weight. In the past 8 months, I’ve only had my period once. I’ve lost weight again, and I lost my period again. My question is, does a period come back when someone is eating a “balanced” number of calories, or does it have to do with body weight?

If I theoretically ate at a calorie maintenance (at a weight lower than my pre-Ed weight) would my period come back? Or does it have to do specifically with body weight? Also, I’m in my teens, and I know that amenorrhea can be dangerous. I’ve read that it can also cause infertility in the future.",1567817505,9/6/2019 19:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/d0pdbj/period_questions/,4

Everything is so confused...I really wanna just scream right now...U know everything actually. Yes I want to be skinnier and skinnier. Yes I am absolutely addicted to it. I just can’t eat. I don’t eat at all. And my psychiatrist told me that I should make a list of 20 foods that I am not scared of. I listed only one - water. She told me “Eat at least three meals a day” and I was like “What? I can’t eat even one??”...

I feel so desperate cuz I am just sitting on the bed and thinking about losing weight and I am measuring and weighing myself all the time. 

I know u guys are fighting and I know that it’s hard for u, too, but could you please tell me - how your recovery did start? Cuz now I literally just can’t eat anything. Why? Because it disgusts me. It makes me cry. It makes me feel miserable...It depresses me. I can’t even look at the others eating.

2199,d0b407,I was recovering. I came to terms with my recovery about 2 years ago. I fell off the wagon and idk why.,"Let me start with I'm not your typical anorexic. I'm naturally small, always have been. I had a tumor that made it difficult for me to gain weight. I never cared though. I didn't want to be heavier. Not because I ever felt fat, I just felt fine being underweight. When they took the tumor out I didn't care to take the steps to gain weight. Again, happy with myself. I do starve myself but it's more of a opposite of eating my feelings thing than a I think I'm fat thing. I know I'm not fat. 

Anyway. I finally got to 113 lbs. Below my doctor's goal but above my own personal goal and I maintained it for about 5 years. I'm back below 100 lbs now. I won't tell my family. I'm back to not caring about my weight or if I eat right. I just layer my clothes so people don't point out that I look thinner. I've been stressed a lot lately... Pretty much always. So I'm down to 1 sort of meal a day. I still feel fine, even though I know I'm heading down a slippery road to not feeling fine, I just can't get up the motivation to care about eating. 

I don't really know what to do about it but I don't think I'd listen to advice. It's just how my head is. I really am here just to vent. It's hard cause I refuse to talk to me family about this stuff, they ask blame the tumor and being naturally small.

I was having a full episode. All the emotion rushed to me, I took laxatives, even though I didn’t even had breakfast yet. I’m just now coming back to my senses as how intense it was. I took a Xanax as I have it prescribed for when I feel anxiety related to my ED and yeah, it has me in my tracks, but I feel now so vulnerable and stupid, I acted out on my bf and he understandably got angry.

I just finally went to the doctor today after accidentally slipping back into horrible habits while overworking myself at my job where I'm on my feet running around  all day.  I dropped weight and stopped eating and before I knew it I spent the weekend at work light headed, sick, and faint.  I've been recovering these past few days off, able to eat a little, (weary nonetheless of refeeding at this point), though on top of this inconsolably upset for hours. I've been sobbing and upset and unfairly dropping all of this on my partner. bless his heart I dont know where I'd be without him. he does everything he can for me, but sadly I'm his first and only experience and knowledge about eating disorders- and I'm a harsh case. 

I've done several treatments. its always an issue where I struggle to gain weight fast enough to their standards despite 100% compliance to meal plans for 6 weeks at least. while being underweight literally my whole life, I always end up putting myself at an ugly risk. but yknow. I'm 24 now. theres only so many times I can let this happen.

2214,d66bn8,"Just need to get this out - Lately, eating makes me feel guilty and shameful","I’m not sure if this is the place to post this, but I need to talk about this before I go crazy.

I’ve never had an ed, but have always had pretty bad self body hate and low self worth issues for as long as I can remember. Due to an accident a year ago making me stop going to the gym regularly and doing sports, I’ve recently gained weight (30 lbs/ 154lbs and 5.5ft) and I really feel bad about it.

For the last 2 months, ever since I started working, I’ve been skipping lunch and only eating dinner. I’ve never really eaten breakfast because I wake up nauseous and can’t make myself eat. But, since no one really pays attention to me at work, I’ve been skipping. It feels like a waste to spend one hour eating when I could be working and go home an hour earlier. My co-worker started to get worried that I wasn’t leaving the office during working hours, so when she’s at her desk during lunch, I leave and take a walk around the block to pretend that I’m getting lunch. If she’s not there at lunch time, I just skip it. I started doing this because I’m paranoid about spending money on food, but it’s snowballed into something more. If I spend more than 10 dollars on food, I feel guilty and try to compensate the next day buy spending less or not eating. I feel proud when I manage to not have lunch because I’m spending less and not eating. I don’t know where this compulsive need to spend less comes from because I’m from a well off family, but I can’t help the guilt of spending money on food I see as non essencial. And if I can’t help not eating, I feel very guilty if I eat more than 9 oz of food. There’s a place close to work that has my favorite food, but it’s 11 dollars and everytime I go there I feel very guilty that I ate the whole plate and spent so much and hate the full feeling. I don’t have the courage to purge, so I’m stuck feeling miserable the whole afternoon. I don’t eat snacks either because it makes me feel very guilty as well. I only eat dinner because my mom makes dinner and I don’t want her to suspect that I’m not eating and I don’t have the heart to throwaway food.

My mom is also part of the problem. Recently, she’s been body shamming me by sending me photos of my past thinner self and of my current fat self and telling me how fat I’ve gotten. It always makes me feel more terrible and fast more. I’ve asked her to stop everytime, but whenever the topic shifts to clothes, she brings up the fact that I’m fat. My clothes still fit me ok, but I hate the fact that when I bend over, my stomach touches. I feel so disgusted when that happens that I need to readjust my position immediately. When I look in the mirror, I see back rolls and how fat I am and spiral into self hate. I still crave certain foods though and somedays I give in and feel very guilty and filled with shame afterwards. I’ve taken to chugging water to stave off the hunger, but am slowly getting used to the feeling. I miss being able to see my ribs when I sucked my tummy in. I also have a younger sister that has always been overweight and my mother keeps sending diets and exercise regiments to her in the family group chat and she’s been tagging me too recently and this just brings a whole new wave of shame and self hate. I don’t think she realises what she’s doing to me, but I also don’t know if she would stop if she knew because she’s been on a big fitness wave recently, like exercising a lot and eating very heathily. She’s given up on my sister losing weight and I think she’s turned her attentions towards me now and I’ve been feeling horrible ever since.

2217,d6302l,Concentration Problems?,"I don’t know if this has to do with under-eating, because when I was anorexic I didn’t really suffer from lack of focus. I don’t know why, but the smallest things affect me now. I was better off before, even if I was probably eating less back then!

Anyways, I can barely focus on school work and make the silliest mistakes. I’m not preoccupied by food or anything, so I don’t know why I make these mistakes. I’m a good student, I’ve never really done these silly mistakes. Also, my energy levels are extremely depleted. I used to go to bed around 10:00-11:00 usually, but now I usually can’t make it past 9:30-10:00! I am so tired by the end of the day (and I don’t even exercise)! (In fact, I’m usually in bed by 8:30-9:30). I find myself using most of my energy trying to focus and study...

I don’t know what this is. I’m probably deficient in some vitamins, but I don’t want to get a blood test done. Any advice on what to do? Or what this is exactly?  Maybe even some tips to improve my concentration?Thanks for your help!",1568835622,9/18/2019 14:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/d6302l/concentration_problems/,3

But today I stepped on the scale and fuck...54kgs. My belly is super bloated too. I know it’s probably cuz I’m constipated but it’s so frustrating and I’m so sad because fuck.

2232,d5b42w,My #neda story,"I have always hated my body.. around 2 years ago I was diagnosed with anorexia, but I was acting on behaviors for many years prior to that. I got help, gained the weight back and started eating healthy. My life started to turn around. I felt happy again, I found my identity again. Then I stepped on the scale for the first time in a year. I went from being underweight to overweight, and this is the story of how I learned to live my worst fear. 
After I recovered from anorexia, my life started to fall into place. Until I started to notice my belly poking out again, my period coming back. The fact that I was eating desert, or posting a picture where you could see my double chin. I stepped on the scale and I was shocked. My weight was higher than it had ever been in my life, and I had gained 3 times what I had lost. I begged to go to weight watchers, I stopped going to therapy and tried to use laxatives again, I started trying to restrict and trying any diet possible because my worst nightmare, what I had always feared was coming true. I lived my worst fear, and everyone stopped caring about my past. All I could hear in the Halls of my highschool was how much weight I had gained, people looked at me disgusted and I gained names like ""miss piggy"" and ""the cow"" I cried every day and started going to the gym. But my urges were so hard to control, and I kept gaining weight and eating. I hated myself for it every day and all I could see was my pain, and how no one cared. I'd like to say that I've overcome it, and I'm doing great now, but the reality is I'm still stuck in this mess. I don't know what to do.

2261,d4eofv,"I’m a healthy weight, Is it possible for me to have anorexia?","(This is long, I tend to ramble I’m sorry) 

As of recently it’s like if become obsessed with my weight and counting calories, and is only been getting so much worse. It started off with me just innocently decided to diet, but I’ve now restricted myself to under 800 calories MAX a day, on average I try to stay around 400. I am terrified of anything with to much added sugar, sodium or anything that’s slightly calorie dense. If I don’t spend the day working I’ll make myself go on the treadmill for around an hour to try and burn off as much as possible. If I do ever eat over 800 calories or just worry I ate to much that day I’ll take laxatives, near the start of summer I was taking them as if they were damn tic tacs. I’ve been weight myself daily and if my weight happens to go up I’ll make myself restrict even more that day. I feel like I’ve literally become afraid of food, I almost had a panic attack and started crying yesterday because I had reached into my cupboard to grab a bagel (didn’t end up eating it), I’ve had several occurrences like this. I’ve always hated my body, I’ve always thought I was fat and I so desperately want to be skinny, I’ve basically become obsessed with the thinspo tag on tumblr. I’m 17, 5’3 and 134lbs, so I’m on the higher end of what’s considered a healthy weight for my height so I don’t feel like it’s possible for me to have an eating disorder because I’m to fat as well as this has only been going on for a couple months?

Hopefully there aren’t any more comments but I have my script all ready to go.  I’m telling the truth, just not the part that anorexia caused the majority of my medical issues.

So I have a 6 month old. I’m still not back to my pre pregnancy weight, even though I’ve been trying. Both healthy and unhealthy means. However, let’s be honest, even if I were back to that weight I’d still hate my body. 

My boyfriend works a ridiculous amount, making me practically a single parent. So I’m stressed, tired, and lonely. I don’t have any friends. I don’t talk to anyone except my son and the dog. I’m sad. I’m so very depressed.

Tonight I decided to have some time to myself. My son is napping, the dog is in the other room on her bed, and I am in the tub. I dropped my phone in the tub. That sucked. Now I’m stressed about that because there’s a crack and half the speakers don’t work. Also, because I’m now stuck staring at my naked body I have this overwhelming desire to hurt myself. Not like the usual self harm, I mean the not eat for a few days, go for two hour long walks every day until I’m happy with what I see. But that will never happen. 

My body isn’t the same. So the old methods won’t work. And nothing new is working either. I’m frustrated, I feel trapped in this shit body and my head is so unhealthy. I don’t even feel real. I’m 27 and I just want to like myself. To feel confident.

He’s been endlessly supportive and always trying to say the right thing and not pressure me one way or the other, but the other day we were talking and I asked him if my body is ugly or if he wishes I was thinner. He told me healthy is the sexiest thing and that he just wants me to be healthy. Which I have then obsessed over and decided that he meant that I need to lose weight to be healthy. Now we’re long distance while I’m abroad until the holidays and I’m obsessing over how much weight I can lose before then, and also feeling repulsed that id ever show my body to him, wishing I hadn’t, spiraling into thoughts that I should just dump him and let him go back to his exes who were all thin and fit and gorgeous...

And I felt better. As if my restricting and obsession with size and calories and my weight and clothing size is worth more than her career success ?? It’s so stupid. 

It’s the same as when I have one of these good body image days and sit in a room thinking, “at least I’m the thinnest in the room”. I may not be the most educated yet, or the top of whatever hierarchy, or the most popular, but I’m the thinnest. Like anyone cares.

I want to let them know this, but I also don't want to come across as patronizing, or like their weight is of importance to me when it's only important in the context of their well-being if that makes sense.

Today for example, they posted saying they were happy with their weight gain, my instant thought is to say ""well done, i'm so happy for you"" because i genuinely am. But is that making too much of a deal out of it?

Maybe i'm overthinking this but i've seen how bad and dangerous it can get and i REALLY don't want to hurt her.

So I was just looking at a picture I had on my phone of a spooky drawing of a very thin vampire creature and accidentally scroll down to see it had categorized it as 'stone sculpture', and the thumbnail for that folder was a picture I took at my worst. Also in the folder was a pic of an Egyptian mummified body. I felt completely sick at first, but after not being able to locate or delete the pic, I just stared at it for a while... and now the ana thoughts are back, but a lot stronger. I feel conflicted because the picture and situation horrified me at first, really made me feel ill and I could see how unwell I looked, but it changed so quickly to me wanting to be that way again, and almost taking the situation as a kinda sick 'compliment'.

2376,d7ext8,Tips for recovery,".I really want to get better and I just wondered if anyone has any tips or anything or ways to distract yourself.

So I'm a 14F and for a couple years I've been more than normally preoccupied with the idea that I was fat and I've always been trying things to lose weight because I was only in the 49/50th percentile for my height ""5'0"" (I'm very small and even though I'm 14 I've basically stopped growing) I tried things like I've always skipped lunch consistently in an effort to lose weight which always made me feel really tired (I barely ate lunch at school in the past two/three years) and rarely I would make myself throw up. I ocassionally skipped lunch and breakfast but I usually just binged on toast by the time I got home anyway. I never really thought of it as a problem I guess bc I never lost anything I just thought of it that it was normal and the most I ever went eating one meal a day was only a couple of days.

That was up until 4 months ago. So, about a month after i started going out with my boyfriend I started to become determined that I would do something about the fact that I was fat because I simply had to lose weight. I don't think this had anything to do with my bf and I'm not entirely sure what triggered it. But I started eating one meal a day in an effort to lose weight... And it worked although ocassionally I would get really hungry and go on binges and a few days I would eat normally. Food became my obsession and it controlled my life I couldn't function properly and I was so... So hungry. I felt so so so trapped like my life would never would get better. But no matter what I wasn't rly skinny enough I mean I think at some point I made it to around the 1st percentile (I don't know what I weigh now it could be more than that bc the scale broke and it probably is more than that) but I wasn't rly thin enough and it became so much more than me being fat because food scared me.

My bf tried his best to support me and he's been the best possible most supportive person ever. And I also have a friend about it who's been supportive but she is dealing with similar shit too. Last Thursday I finally went to see a doctor about my concerns who was very reassuring and wrote me a referral for something and she explained the situation to my dad and yesterday I broke down because even though with the help of my bf I've been eating lunch I'm still struggling and asked for help and he explained it to my mum... I think and I rly want to get better... For me... My bf... And so I can be finally happy.",1569093742,9/21/2019 14:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/d7ext8/tips_for_recovery/,2

2380,d74w7x,I skipped dinner and now I’m only allowed to eat carbs,"Last night I had planned on eating pasta salad, I had it ready in a container in my mom’s fridge in her classroom so she could bring it when she picks me up from swim. I don’t blame her, but I reminded her before and after swim was over and she didn’t bring it. She made red beans and rice that night and I didn’t eat cause I planned on eating one of my fear foods for dinner. This morning my heart was beating real fast and this afternoon my heart staring beating slower and I felt like I couldn’t hold myself up. My chemistry teacher pulled me out of class to ask me if I was ok and I said “Yea, in fine. Just tired and a little sick” he kept asking if that was it and nothing else was going on but I told him that I was ok and that I texted my dad to pick me up. I didn’t know my dad had changed his number, and our service in the classroom is garbage so nothing goes through anyway. I texted my sister during my weightlifting class while we were outside, for her to text my dad to make sure he knew to pick me up. After school ended he still didn’t answer either me or my sister and my mom got mad. She said that she needed to be contacted first, which I understand she should be, but I didn’t want to bother her while she was teaching a class. She took me to swim and told her the truth, I hadn’t eaten in 2 days. I had to tell my coach the same thing and he told me I had to go home and “Carb up” for tomorrow’s meet and that he’s dealt with kids that wouldn’t eat for days before a game or meet who have died because of it. He hadn’t noticed anything, but today when I told him he relized that that’s the reason why I’ve been slacking during swim practices. Now he’s gonna be making sure I eat and have energy. I feel disgusting and sick and tomorrow I have a swim meet, I’m pretty sure that if I don’t feel good than he’s able to put someone else in my place but I don’t want to make him do another 3 hours of paperwork. Is there anyway that I can feel better by tomorrow morning? I’ve eaten the pasta salad, one and a half serving of lasagna, one slice of raisin bread, half of a small capachino blast from Duncan Donuts, a serving of cream cheese, and water, but I feel like that just made my heart feel the same or a little better, and my stomach feels weird like it wants more but like I’ll just get even worse if I do eat. I’m also scared my mom will get me a dietitian, she’s threatened to do that in the past but I’m pretty sure that getting a dietitian is too expensive anyway. Would eating tomorrow morning make me feel better and energized? We leave around 5:30am to get to the bus and leave so I’m waking up at 4:30am, 4:00 if I eat cereal.",1569033258,9/20/2019 21:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/d74w7x/i_skipped_dinner_and_now_im_only_allowed_to_eat/,2

2388,d6q4qy,Hey all.,"I just joined this sub, and I honestly don't know if I belong here. I'm not entirely sure if I have an eating disorder, because I often feel healthy. So I guess I'm asking for advice. Here's my deal- 

I eat an ok amount of food. I usually eat a small breakfast, sometimes I don't. I prefer that I don't, because it gives me something to focus on, but I mostly eat in the mornings. I sometimes eat the designated school lunch, but when I forget money or think I might have forgotten money I get excited because I don't have to eat. I eat dinner as well, but not every night and usually small portions. However in the end, it's enough to make me not feel hungry all the time and it's enough to keep me alive.

I don't exercise, so I have no reason to eat a lot. I feel healthier when I let myself get by on the smallest amounts of food, and make eating less of a priority. I also don't care a lot about how my body looks, but sometimes after I've eaten a lot I feel fat. So I feel like I can't be anorexic because from what I've heard you have to hate your body and want to be skinny. I feel like I'm not allowed to have an eating disorder, because I'm naturally slim. But is it possible that eating and wanting the most control possible over what you eat and when counts as an eating disorder? Is it just something other than anorexia? 

Also; food grosses me out. When I eat it's not incredibly healthy, so I feel terrible about it. This makes me want to eat less but not eat better. If I ate the food I eat but in larger quantities I'd be a lot bigger. But if I exercised and ate healthy I'd probably be really skinny and actually healthy. I don't have the motivation to work out and eat healthy food, so I'm just eating small amounts of food that not food for you. 

Overall, not eating and focusing on the hunger that I have makes me feel powerful. And the feeling of being hungry and eating as little as possible makes me happy, so does this mean I have anorexia or some kind of eating disorder, or an I just lazy and unhealthy? I just feel like because I eat enough that I don't look gaunt and am naturally skinny it's not possible for me to anorexic. I'm not asking you to diagnose me, but Id really appreciate some clarity because my eating habits are taking up too much of my brain atm.

2398,d6hfqk,Addict behaviors and addict help?,"I went to therapy yesterday for the first time in a couple months and she finally got me to talk about my ED. Before I go into this post id like to make it known that I have a personal disdain for addicts. I watched my step dad die, I'm watching my sister go down the same road. If you're seeking help good, if you're an active addict that doesn't realize they have a problem, I hate you. 

That being said, I couldn't help but to sit there and list all of the behaviors that are similar between ED and addiction. 

Every church in my county has postings for NA and AA meetings but I never see anything for ED. There are 4 halfway houses within a 10 mile radius for recovering addicts but there's no such place anywhere around here for ED. There are advertisements all over the place for help in this opioid epidemic we are facing but I see no adds for help with ED even though it's a massive issue. 

The typical self treatment options aren't helping me. Food journals are shit. Counting calories is shit. Eating more is a wish on a candle at this point. I need help and I can't find it yet pharmacies are offering free narcan to civilians to help someone if they see an overdose. Wheres my help when I faint from lack of nutrition? 

The behaviors are so similar. Lying, stealing, hiding, disassociating, passing out, etc. And they both can lead to terrible deaths but I don't see a plethora of churches reaching out begging anorexics to get help. 

On top of it all, insurance often will help pay for a 30 day rehab program for opioid addicts (big pharma loves to double tap) but insurance fights to cover therapy for ED. There are rehabs here and there for anorexia, they're called mental hospitals, and insurance fights it. 

How can I cry for help when there is so little, But a guy on the corner with a crack addiction gets neighborhood outreach he didn't even ask for?

I couldn’t even bring myself to go to the gym today and even though I keep telling myself it’s ok because I haven’t taken a day off in weeks, I’m still beating myself up for it. I just didn’t have it in me to go, but my ED doesn’t care. So I kept my calorie intake low. 2 eggs this morning and an apple for a snack, that’s it. My husband calls on the way home and asks what I wanted for dinner and it just stressed me out because we have nothing to cook at home so I now have to figure out what to go food place has a meal with the absolute lowest calories. I decide on a salad from Panera. He gets home after waiting there 30 minutes and they never put my food in the bag and he never checked. We live 20 minutes away so it’s not worth it to drive back so they send us a gift card instead. Great so I threw money away for nothing and have nothing to eat, because sharing his Mac n cheese just isn’t an option. So I make myself a can of soup we had in the pantry. My husband feeling terrible grabs it out of the microwave and drops it everywhere. I feel like the universe is just telling me I shouldn’t eat. That I’m lazy and fat and don’t deserve food. The rational part of me knows this all was just an accident and some bad luck, but again my ED doesn’t care. So I have a full blown panic attack over some spilled food. I’m so frustrated that I’m so upset over this. Since when does food control my life so much? I use to love food, it use to be comforting. But now it’s just a possessive thought constantly going through my head. How much food, what kind, and when I can eat. I hate this, but I hate being fat even more.

I think high school and the people i kept around me were big triggers and after i left and sought a new therapist i thought i had put it behind me. 

But here we are, weak and sick from not eating enough. It's only the beginning though. I live in a toxic house with my grandmother when i was eating enough and exercising she kept making comments about how i shouldn't eat so much and how I'm already fat if i just cut my food intake in half and continue exercising I'll be pretty in no time. This is the same woman who fed my mother skim milk as an infant because she was too fat. 

It's not like I'm not eating at all. But i normally only eat once a day now. And its never enough, I've started counting calories and weighing myself more and more often. I need to break the cycle before i really fuck my body up again. There's no way i can get out of the house though. I don't want to go back but ive already slipped so far. How did i stop in the past?

Now, the roommate I share a room with is a girl, and we don't get along fantastically, especially when it comes to mental health. My other roommate is my gay best friend (a guy). As we're walking in, she goes, ""I know the real reason we never go out to eat. Because all three of us are anorexic.""

And I got super triggered and super quiet, because, yeah. So I order a salad and fries to share with them, they both get meals with fry sides, and we eat. I'm about halfway through my salad, and she goes ""Wow. Fuck yeah for us for eating! I'm proud of us!"" and high-fives our other roommate, then me. She turns her head towards me and says, and I quote, ""I'm less proud of you because you eat more than we do on a regular basis.""

Went to the bathroom to panic and succeeded in not purging the salad I did manage to eat. How can I ever eat around my roommates again when she went and said something like that. Not 20 minutes prior the 3 of us were at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and I snuck away from them to weigh myself. Been losing sleep reading forums. They have no idea how bad it's gotten. I am so scared I'm gonna quit eating until they are forced to be concerned.

2477,daf51e,Amenorrhea?,"
TW: Numbers, Calories

I don’t understand why I don’t have my period. I’ve had it once in the past 8 months (when I became my pre-Ed weight). After that, I lost over 10+ pounds.I wouldn’t say that I’ve “relapsed” since I’ve indulged in my fair share of binges and I’m not underweight yet by a few pounds. 

Either way, I don’t think my amenorrhea has that much to do with calorie intake since I’m not even restricting THAT much. I’m just disappointed in myself for having to lie to my family. I remember when my period came back, everyone was happy. They finally thought I was a “healthy girl” again. I believe it has to do with hormones. When I first had anorexia, they made me take a blood test. I don’t particularly remember the results, but the doctor could tell I was lying about getting my period due to the under-active hormones in my results. I wanted to know if there is any way I could possibly treat this in a “discrete” way. I’m sure it has to do with hormones due to all the weird mood swings I’ve been getting.  Sorry for the long post, just giving context...

TL;DR:
Had my period once in past 8 months. Lost weight again, lost my period. Any tips on how to restore it?",1569672374,9/28/2019 7:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/daf51e/amenorrhea/,0

2490,d9xclb,Scaring Myself Again // Need Advice,"Hi all, first time poster here. I've had a long history with poor eating habits, struggling with both anorexia &amp; bulimia throughout being a teenager (I'm almost 21 now). I went through about a year-long period around junior year of high school where I heavily restricted my calories &amp; ended up losing a scary amount of weight, although I never became underweight so no one really took my disorder very seriously, even though it was drastic &amp; earned me lots of VERY positive reinforcement for my weight loss.

...One of the things I used to cherish the most was being able to see or feel my bones more easily as I lost more &amp; more weight.

I fully recovered &amp; have been eating (relatively) normally for almost three years now, not gaining all of the weight back but definitely gaining enough to be at what looks like ""normal"" for me. But recently, as I've moved out of my family home &amp; have been working a ridiculous amount along with doing theatre, I've started losing weight without a conscious effort. I'll skip meals very often, &amp; more than occasionally will go through the majority of my day before realizing I haven't eaten. Even though I'm not hyper-focused on counting calories again, I do find myself feeling my ribs through the flesh on my upper chest for comfort, and grabbing my stomach abusively when I feel hungry instead of getting up to do something about it, or intentionally avoiding the grocery store both due to lack of finances &amp; a lack of desire to spend the money I DO have on food. I don't have access to a scale so I don't even know if I've actually lost any weight, or if I'm just having a mental relapse in avoiding eating, but proceeding like it's not as much of a problem because ""it's not on purpose"" (even though, I know it actually is). I haven't weighed myself in months, but when I was recently measured for a costume fitting I found that I'd lost several inches around my bust/hips/legs etc, so I know this physical change is real, even though the comments are nowhere near the volume that they used to be. &amp; I love it. I don't feel sick, because I'm not weighing myself or counting calories, but I am obsessed with the feeling of my bones through my skin &amp; my clothes getting looser &amp; looser on me, &amp; I'm afraid I won't be able to shake this before more people start commenting on how good I look &amp; the illness gets stronger from the positive reinforcement.

Can anybody relate to this? How do you encourage yourself to eat when you're ridiculously busy &amp; skipping meals &amp; chalking it up to being forgetful is just so fucking easy?

Please help. Looking for any kind of advice, support or encouragement. Thank you so much. for taking the time to read this.",1569572388,9/27/2019 3:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/d9xclb/scaring_myself_again_need_advice/,3

2494,d9nm07,"Tretament consult questions/rant......TW treatment discussion, weight, BMI, etc","Okay, this is probably going get a world record for the dumbest post, but honestly, my brain is so fried that Gordon Ramsay would have a conniption.

So I had a consult for ED treatment yesterday and the psychiatrist was concerned about my frequency of symptoms and my low weight. 

&amp;#x200B;

I previously did day hospital treatment with another program (lol I hated that program, they told me I wasn't ""sick enough"" for inpatient). I finished the program and I did outpatient for a couple of months, but I'm back to my old shitty ways and I got discharged from outpatient because I was too symptomatic and I've relapsed (that's a whole other can of worms lol, but honestly I'm glad to be done with that program, I and everyone I know who did the program hated it).

&amp;#x200B;

The psychiatrist I did the consult with said that I need intensive treatment again, and mentioned day hospital in passing, but didn't really definitively say ""i'm going to refer you to day hospital"" VS ""I'm going to refer you to inpatient.""

&amp;#x200B;

I found out from my GP today that the consultation note the psychiatrist sent him said that I need intensive treatment, and she wants to start me with intensive day hospital ""at the very least"".

I have to discuss my treatment plan with my individual coordinator in the next week or two, but I just keep overthinking what the psychiatrist said: like does that mean she's considering inpatient or not? I know this could all be clarified if I contacted the program, but some weird part of me is afraid that they'll be like ""no you don't need inpatient, just day hospital"" . It's weird, I know.  I guess I'm afraid of not being ""sick enough"" again. But at the same time, inpatient is really hard and strict. I was inpatient for other mental health issues, and although its not the same, I get the gist. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have to have a further assessment with my treatment coordinator and a physician to (assess medical stability I guess) in the next couple of weeks, and I feel like the assessment with the treatment coordinator will involve discussion about if inpatient is feasible at this time (like my situation and can I commit to it etc). Day hospital wait time is 4-6 months at the moment, although I hear that inpatient is a shorter wait list. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience? I'm in Canada if that matters and the program I'll be doing is entirely publically funded, hence the wait times. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, does anyone know what the general weight restoration BMI is? I feel like I'll be on weight restoration given the psychiatrist's comment/concern about my weight, but I'm also not completely sure and that's giving me anxiety too.

&amp;#x200B;

If you got to the end of this very disorganized and rambly post, thank you for reading! 

&amp;#x200B;

Take care!

2528,deyo1k,A girl in my health class just called me heavy,"It happened a little while ago and I really need to tell someone or I'll go mad.

Today in health class we practised moving injured people (you know, making a little chair thing with your arms and picking up the person) and one pair was struggling to pick up the other person. So the person they were trying to pick up said 'why don't you try Aiiga? She's small' (I'm probably the shortest person in my class) and I came over, because my name was mentioned and I wanted to help. Then, one of the girls looked at me and said 'no, I can't do it. She's too heavy.'. 

And, honestly, up to that moment I thought I was completely fine, I've even started eating normally again. But at that moment I was so crushed. I asked her what she just said, visibly shaking (at least I didn't yell at the poor thing). It took all my strength not to start crying and not to embarass myself further, thought I don't know if I could feel more humiliated.

Now I just want to crawl into a hole and cry until I die. I know I'm probably overreacting but I'm scared I'm going to hurt myself badly now. It's the first time I've experienced something like that and before I've let myself think that I'm not really sick, that I'm just like a normal girl that wants to be skinny, but now I truly realise that there is a problem.

I'm not significantly underweight... I'm too fat to be underweight...

2533,des530,I recovered a few years ago but I feel like It never really went away.,"So I started with all this when I was like 12. I was the ugly fat and poor girl in a rich girls school so of fucking course I was bullied. I stopped eating (or puking), it was 2012 so all this tumblr thinspo stuff made things worst. I still remember the mirror inside my closet in my old room, full of ""pretty girls don't eat"" and ""do you want to be thin or do you want that burger"" shit.

The two months I losed 10kg. I'm 1.65cm but was a little shorter back then.

So, it continued untill I was 16 and I only stopped that time I ended in an hospital because I was in really bad shape. Funny thing is, even if my body changed and I losed weight, I never got skinny. Like really really skinny (that's why no one ever noticed they just thought I was losing weight in a healthy way because I looked healthy)

I learned that I just can't be skinny, I can't have a flat stomach or small tights. I don't consider myself chubby not skinny. My body is a weird in between.

I learned to live with this, and now I'm 19 and I was kinda good with it. But no, not really.

I've never stoped hating that one, that one only tummy roll or my too big tights. My arms that are too skinny in comparison of the rest of me. I can't. I feel bad. I feel like I'm in school again, my uni is full of pretty rich girls (just like in school, I'm only here because I won a scholarship). And again I feel like the ugly, fat, poor girl. Even if I'm not really fat, even if I don't fucking consider being fat a bad thing.

I have no problem with being fat, my problem is with my body being my body. I'm not fat, not skinny, not chubby I'm just me and I hate it.

What triggered it? I loved my skirts, a lot. Tight and short but not too short. Now my tights are too big and my skirts are way too shorts for me to wear at uni. (It's literally full of stairs so no thanks).

I haven't been eating this week and I feel like an idiot for believing that I could live with this. How could I?

Yes, I have professional help. And yes, I also have a severe depression that I developed kinda at the same time but for different issues. If anyone has any advise on how to just not relapse that would be cool. But honestly I know no one will read this.

I read somewhere that you can't hate your body into a shape you'll love, am I fucked?",1570493278,10/7/2019 19:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/des530/i_recovered_a_few_years_ago_but_i_feel_like_it/,5

2538,deo84e,"It's been 6 years after my ED, and I still have a complicated relationship with food","I went into recovery from my ED 6 years ago, and have managed to not relapse. I do this through various means, such as having no measuring tape, scale, or full body mirrors in my apartment.

Still, I stay on the lower end of a healthy weight, sometimes dipping below healthy - I only know this from doctor appointments where they weigh me, I don't monitor my weight. I think this is because I still hate eating. Whenever I eat anything, I feel guilt and disgust. It's more like a chore than anything else, and it's probably my least favourite chore at that.

So I don't eat much. I am also reluctant to cook, because whatever I make I know I'll be unable to fully enjoy. So it's mostly quick meals - mostly healthy, low fat meals - and snacking on bananas and grapes throughout the day. Heck, sometimes I'll have some tea (no milk or sugar) and call that a meal. I have days where I feel light headed and weak as a result of this.

Does anyone else experience this? Is this a regular mindset to have even years after recovery?

I looked up the menu online and calculated how many calories are in what and how much I can eat within my limit. I get so much anxiety going out to eat (as I’m sure all of us do), and I just don’t want to have an anxiety attack while out with my family. So please keep me in your thoughts, I will update y’all tonight.

2549,de8bz6,Do you ever see How thin you are all of A Sudden and get mildly creeped out,"Like today, I was dressing infront of my full length mirror. I was bending over to pull my trouser socks up before putting on my pants. Oddly I noticed the actual size of my legs despite dressing in front of mirrors all the time.

It happens infrequently but not “rarely” whether I’m in relapse, remission or post-recovery. 

Sometimes it makes me wonder whether I was perceiving myself as thinner as I actually am lol.

2569,dda9b5,Suicidal ideation and anorexia,"I was having a conversation with a friend who has struggles of her own with ED but has been on a better road to recovery and has been coaching me through mine. She was encouraging me to disassociate less from my body and to love myself more:

Her: You have helped me so much approach self love. I hope that you can find the courage to approach it yourself.

Me: I have love for myself... Just no kindness. Unyielding fights for survival. I can't relate to my body. My body is treacherous, and going against my need to survive and thrive. It must be cut out. 

Her: This is heartbreaking to read because it sounds like psychologically you're committed to dying. Your body is innocent, my love.

Me: If you think that I need to hear that, then i probably shoud. I don't feel suicidal, I feel rational.

Her: Suicide is often about rationality, in my humble experience. But self love is a choice. 

(then she talked about my futile attempts to love someone that wasn't accepting my love)

Her: Sometimes we must first choose to be kind-- not because it comes from an inspired, passionate place, but because it is the first step to becoming well. In this whole life, you will have many loves and many loses, you already have. But your body will be a constant companion. It will not leave you, you will ultimately leave it. And it will serve you as a devoted and dedicated slave until the moment you draw your last breath.

She tells me that she is getting help and she is better, but hard to trust someone with an addiction who lives far from home. Is it morally wrong to read her diary only to help her ?

I said I knew part of it was my body dysmorphia but that even though I lost a lot of weight, I felt like it was primarily muscle mass and not fat and thats why I look exactly the same. She told me my concern was valid and that because I restricted so heavily and didn’t exercise much that it probably was mostly muscle. so in short, I think that i see myself for how i really am, just am heavily dissatisfied. i’m also angry. why does my body store fat if it’s not going to utilize it?? what was all that bullshit i learned about fat being an energy reserve?

Last Saturday I had a  complete break down making my boyfriend live a real hell, spending the night preventing me from touching myself. Once again I am hurting my friends and loved ones.
I have reach the point where I think that self internment is the best thing to do.

today i ate about 700kcal over what i was aiming for, but im too scared to actually work it out exactly so my total (1500kcal) is just a complete estimate lol. i know that logically thats just enough calories but i still feel like ive binged and eaten so much. im trying to be proud of myself for eating that much (and in front of people no less) but i just feel so bad. im holding onto the fact that my weight is maintaining, not gaining, and i am slowly (slowly) losing. it feels like the only thing keeping me from going insane haha.

i have some meetings with my psychiatrist tomorrow so ill probably have to bring this up, but its the first time ill have properly talked about it and i still dont feel ‘sick enough’ for them to take it and me seriously. ive dropped about 4kg in a month (again, just an estimate. im so afraid to step on the scales but its already controlling my every move), and my mental health is rapidly, and obviously declining outside of the ed mentality but i still feel like i wont be taken seriously. its just making me want to restrict and restrict until i look obviously sick and then people will have to believe me.

I’m going to keep this as brief as possible. I have been in recovery for a few months now and last night I went out after I had fasted for a few days and ate a McDonalds (it was counted). Afterwards, I went to the movies and had some popcorn (that wasn’t counted). This is a lot more than I usually eat and when I got out of the cinema I started feeling really weird. 

I basically couldn’t walk properly, I was stumbling around everywhere, my speech made no sense and I was really confused about everything (where I was etc). I was having sweats and hot flushes. 

I called NHS direct (I live in the UK), and then advised me to go to A and E but when I went they said I was low priority and probably should go home.

2638,dgywxp,Normal Calorie Intake for Recovery,"This isn’t a vent, but a question. No flair for that. 

I’m 45 and recently slipped into anorexia over the past two months. I was trying to lose 10 lbs. after eating a very poor diet for most of last year. Also one of my EDs. I binged in candy and pasta. I ate until I felt sick. Never purged. I’ve never been underweight before. 

After decades of trying to find the right mental health care I was quickly able to stop binging  completely. So I lost the few lbs and got down to my typical weight, which has always been on the low end of acceptable weight for my height. I ate healthy and wasn’t restricting. But I think cutting out almost everything from my binge diet totally changed my outlook on food. 

And then I kept losing. Food didn’t taste the same anymore. I didn’t want to eat. I got full quickly. I have IBS, which has complicated things. I started a new medication and that made me nauseous for a few days then got sick (nothing major but enough to make me not want to eat.) Now I’m 7 lbs under weight and my BMI is below 17.5. My psychologist and SO have commented on it. My clothes are falling off me. I can feel all my bones. I don’t want to stay like this let alone get worse.

One thing I would like to say to you young people is please try to embrace recovery at an early age. I thought I was the best at my ED especially in high school. I thought I had it mastered and it was my main focus and now it’s just something that I would love to put behind me, and I’m still working on that. It’s taken relationships, happiness, self image and so much more away from me. All because of what? Some food? Learn to eat healthy and live a healthy lifestyle at a young age. Don’t let this spiral out of rebellion. 

Take care of yourself because at the end of the day this is YOUR life, when your sick and in the throws of this disease you will be the only one that can get you out of it and at once you get past a certain point it will only become more difficult. It does not have to get there. If your parents are bothering you that’s a sign that you are mature enough to logically communicate with them and if you don’t have logical parents like most of us don’t then it’s going to be up to you to do all you can to reach out to a trusted adult to help you. 

I know this is hard. Life isn’t always gonna be fun times like my grandma says, so do the work to feel better. Learn how to make good decisions for yourself. This mental illness can take over your mind if YOU let it. It doesn’t have to get there. If you truly have no one to talk to and you can’t afford treatment the journaling will be your best friend! If you believe in God then also pray! This is also a wonderful subreddit so stay as active as you can on here and don’t be afraid to vent. 

I know there are a lot of ignorant people in this world, (sometimes even in this very subreddit) but don’t let them get you down. 

Don’t let anyone bully you, cut off toxic friends and people from your life relentlessly and unapologetically. Do whatever is best for YOU! I wish I had someone to tell me these things when I was younger and even now. Don’t let anyone baby you, now isn’t the time for that. It’s time to grow up and face the reality that you are sick and need to get better. Focus on yourself as much as you can until you see positive results and don’t stop when things are gong well, that’s the trick! Keep going! You may not ever be over this mental illness, it may be a lifelong battle so get ready!",1570867604,10/12/2019 3:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dgs86t/i_never_realized_so_many_people_were_actively/,2

hi all, this could be very triggering for some people as i go pretty in depth about my body type and numbers. I have previously struggled with starving myself and self harm for a long time. i lost about 25 pounds in 2 months. i recovered and ive already gone through the cycle of body positivity and loving my body and i have been really happy with where my body is for a while. i am 5'7"", 160 pounds, and i do have a really nice body for what it is. my waist is 28 inches but my butt is 44. people compliment me a lot for being ""slim thicc"" and i have been really happy with this for a while. over the course of the last year and a half or so, i have become really interested in fitness. even though ive always gone to the gym, i developed a greater appreciation for athleticism and im beginning to favor a smaller shape. ive been in college for about 2 months and i have been going to the gym 4 times a week in a healthy way. i have incorporated cardio and i eat a lot healthier than i did at home. my goal is 140 so it isnt super drastic. however, im beginning to get frustrated. my weight hasn't budged at all. if anything, ive gained like 4 pounds. ive had constantly urges to self harm and ive made a conscious decision to start restricting myself again. i think i can do it in a healthy way. i know that doesnt make sense and i know that isnt how it works but i get so frustrated and i remember how easy it was to lose that weight when i did it the first time and i could have kept it off but i became too comfortable in my ""body positivity"" that i became reckless with how i ate. im just frustrated. i want to be smaller. i want to be athletic. i have restricted myself to about 600-1000 calories a day, but whenever i reach 1000, I want to throw up. i look at food now and my stomach drops. i look at smaller bodies and i wince. ive been looking at recovery photos and thinking yeah, that's great, you look great, but that isnt what I want to look like!!!!! I look at myself and i want to go back to self harming because it used to feel good to cut the parts of me i didnt like. im coming on 4 years clean from self harm and ive come a long way in a lot of ways. its really disappointing how easy it is to fall back into these habits. its even scarier how comfortable i feel allowing this mindset to take over again.",1570816316,10/11/2019 12:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dgipd5/starting_to_fall_back_into_it/,0

i think i’ve always had a slow metabolism but does anyone else feel like having an ED for so long has totally ruined their metabolism to the point where eating normally seems impossible?

for context ive had both anorexia and bulimia for 10 years. my metabolism has always been kinda slow, like when i was younger i had to consume a lot of caffeine and eat a lot less (even compared to other anorexics) to get just barely underweight. 
now im in my 20s and for me eating “normally” means 800-1000 calories a day. a year ago i decided to start eating more to appease a partner at the time. i feel like “normal” people are able to eat like 1200+ calories and are able to maintain healthy weights. i was eating 800-1200 calories earlier this year when i decided to recover and somehow i still became overweight instead of just maintaining a healthy a weight. i feel like i cant recover without getting fat so i might as well just stay anorexic. 

now i never eat more than 450 calories and im even prescribed a rlly heavy duty weight loss medication and while ive lost 10 lbs in 2.5 weeks it seems like ive plateaued. ive never had such a hard time losing weight before (im very “good” at losing weight). im terrified im going to be stuck this way.

2679,dm8skk,This is so much easier when my dad keeps his mouth shut,"Trigger warning: just like super negative body comments from my dad and the amount I struggle with it

Background: I was diagnosed with anorexia in 2012. I never got proper therapy, I just gained a ton of weight on birth control and nobody talked about it. I stopped purging, but I was still restricting. Medication has been a wild ride, because after the birth control came an antidepressant that took it all off, to the point I was underweight and had to stop taking it. What they replaced it with made me gain almost 100lbs. And then as luck would have it my current med lineup is perfect, and I’ve lost all the weight. Losing weight felt really good. Putting on pants that didn’t fit a few months ago felt really good. Getting acknowledged by everyone I know felt really good. I’ve spent the entire last year on a loop of “have you lost weight?” “Yep, Xlbs!” “You look great!” But I’m really really trying here. I’m not allowed to lose more than 5lbs more. When I found out I’d lost 3lbs, I panicked. That gives me 2lbs before I start losing the things I need. So I bought like pop tarts for breakfast, that instant breakfast stuff you mix into milk, like a huge tub of cheese balls to try and eat while I’m doing homework and distracted. I’m trying so hard. And I mean I’m torn because my instinct is not to have those things because they’re empty calories, but also I don’t want to lose my medication. I almost wonder if my doctor set a weight limit because I have a history of eating disorder? My BMI is still on the high end of healthy and I don’t understand. But whatever.

It’s hard enough fighting with myself over it all day. But my dad has started up again about it and I can’t with that. He saw me pouring instant breakfast and said “do you have any idea how much sugar is in that?” I’ve told him I need to stop losing weight. And when I said I need to work harder on eating enough calories for my new metabolism, he said “but you’re not going to *put on* any, right?” With just this tone of disgust. And I can’t handle it. And I don’t know what to do. I haven’t really had the urge to purge in years, but every time he says something it makes me want to. So I just go in the bathroom and argue with myself and cry.

I weighed myself and was all happy that I was finally 105. But then I took out my digital scale (the one that also shows ounces not just one number) and it said 106.4. 

Today the original one I’ve been using said 105 and the digital said 106.6


That day and night I didn’t eat anything or drink much.  I also didn’t today. So why did the ounces go up from 4 to 6 the next day after another day of still not eating much and maybe having a bit of Gatorade? Like 5 small gulps?

2693,dluglk,I started recovering two weeks ago. It’s been going well and that is shocking to me.,"I went through the nonstop need to eat for a week straight. It was alarming. I’d completely forgotten what hunger had felt like and used to fast for weeks, so it was incredibly overwhelming and scary. That part stopped at the beginning of this week (surprisingly early) and now I’m eating 3 normal meals a day. I finally caved and weighed myself today for the first time, because I thought I was starting to actually look better somehow. I figured I must have gained at least 5lbs and looked better because of that somehow. When I used to fast, I would gain weight from just a few random meals. So, I gathered my courage and got on the scale. *I weigh the same as right before I started recovery.* I just don’t look like I’m dying anymore. I don’t really *need* to gain weight with a BMI of 19, but I wouldn’t be mad about 5-10lbs (and am still emotionally ready for that if it does happen) 

But...holy shit you guys, I’m not longer afraid of gaining a bunch of weight from recovery! (I’ve seen a lot of recovery pictures that have triggered the shit out of me into thinking this was inevitable) I think my body is actually pretty close to where it wants to be... and now I feel kind of stupid for restricting so hard and putting myself in the hospital when I could have just...eaten normally? 

I guess my personal takeaway is, recovery is weird and different for everyone. Thank you so much to this group, it really helped give me the push I needed.",1571807108,10/23/2019 0:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dluglk/i_started_recovering_two_weeks_ago_its_been_going/,1

For example, let’s say you have been anorexic from the ages 15-30. Then you get treatment and recover and maintain a healthy diet from that point forward. Would the 15 years of anorexia have any negative consequences later in life?  
I’m curious even for “small” things. Such as: thyroid issues (Hashimotos, Graves, etc), auto immune, hair loss, liver issues (elevated bilirubin?), bone/joint and muscle issues, IBS or other gastrointestinal issues, nerve damage, etc.

Hi everyone, I’m not officially diagnosed with anorexia or an ED, but I have been very obsessive over my weight (specifically losing it through restricting/purging) for about 12 years now. My father always told me I was obese as a kid, which looking back I definitely was not, and that I would die by the age of 12 of a heart attack from my unhealthy weight. Ever since then, it has become a lifelong goal for me to lose weight but I just can’t seem to get rid of it. My weight has always fluctuated from my binging and restricting/purging periods, and occasional points when I try healthy eating and exercising. However, having PTSD at the same time - it’s sometimes hard for me to get out of bed to actually get out and have the energy to do anything at all, least of all exercise. Lately my thoughts around food have been getting much worse. They’ve become all-consuming, paired with intense self-deprecation and self-harm because of how much hatred and disgust I feel towards myself. I stopped feeling hungry, or just ignore it so well that I don’t notice it anymore. I’ve had about 1 small dinner’s worth of food in the past two days because I feel nauseous at the thought of eating, and feel like I don’t deserve to eat because I let myself get so fat that I need to lose weight (I’m 5’2”, around 75kg). Although I inherently know that I’m not grotesquely obese, it’s all I can see in the mirror - and all I can see when I pinch at my skin and all the fat underneath it. I’m now unable to sleep because I find the urge to lose weight so overwhelming and crave doing sit-ups now at 2am just to burn off some extra calories. 


Please help me, I know this is unhealthy but I don’t know how to stop. What do I do?",1571786571,10/22/2019 18:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dlqfwa/i_need_help/,0

We will likely take a few pictures there and I am terrified that I'll stand out in pictures since I'm bigger than the guys (about 1-2 sizes).

I'm trying to lose a dress size by then so that I'll be closer to the 'average' size in the group but realistically speaking I doubt I'll be able to lose 10kg soon enough. I cant fast because of work so I'm just heavily restricting and moving more.

 However, I cant help but feel horrible hoping she'll come just so that I can have a chance of looking decent. Mainly because I've always been THAT person in the group that makes others look better.

If you have to ask that question then you’re lucky. But also you will never really know what it is like unless you live in it yourself. 
it’s like everyday is determined by your anorexia... everything is surrounding it and all thoughts feelings and things we do- can all be decided just by stepping on the scale that day.

Its losing people, becoming into someone you do not know, losing yourself, fading away into half dead where you’re not dead but you are not alive. It’s taking up as little space as you can because you don’t belong. It’s protecting yourself. Protecting yourself from hurt and anxiety... out of control things. Anorexia takes control slowly then it surprises you every time the voices hit back... each time harder and harder. Relapse after relapse. Not fearing death yet not wanting to die.. for some that’s just the goal. Malnourishing and slowing down your body as you go farther and farther.

2716,dle5fe,Today I went to see my Psychiatrist,"He asked me all the standard questions. And then he said “Are you eating...?” In sort of a concerned way. He doesn’t actually know about my eating disorder history. When I met him I was 27 lbs heavier. So honestly that question made my day. Because no one else in my life except my mom has acknowledged my weight loss.

And I get it, no one who knows me wants to Eff with saying the wrong things when they know I have an eating disorder. I think they know by now saying *anything* is a problem. If they say I look healthy I think I’m fat. If they say I look too thin, it fuels me to keep going. And they’d never say I look overweight even if I am.

But it felt really good for someone to acknowledge this, not just because obviously we always wanna hear that concerned “omg you’re so thin” or “are you eating enough??” It felt good because I really truly (not in an anorexic way of thinking but realistically) gained like over 30 lbs within 3 months due to grieving and depression. So I honestly was too big for my size. And it took a shit ton of discipline and exercise to get where I am right now. Which, to some might look normal. To some might look small, (especially people who met me when I gained all the weight) and to some might look way too small. Honestly, this is an “ok” weight for me where I’m not gonna be utterly miserable but I’m also not satisfied. It’s healthy ENOUGH to pass for just possibly being a smaller individual. It’s close to the weight I normally fall at when I’m not under or overeating. But it’s def not my happy goal weight. It’s 10 lbs away from that. 

I wish when people said that to me it didn’t light a fire in me to keep going, or that it didn’t make my entire week. That my existence and my happiness literally laid upon anything else than someone noticing I’ve lost a lot of weight in just two months. He asked me how much I weigh and I lied and said I was about 7 lbs heavier to be in the triple digits. He said “ok well, keep eating and stay there ! Or else you’ll waste away” this made me even happier and also feel sick at the same time. I hate how unhealthy and sick this disease is. It shouldn’t make me happy to hear that or inspire me to lose more. Or make me feel like I’ve succeeded but it does. That’s just the name of the game. 

Highlight of my week, one person finally acknowledging I lost 27 lbs. did I need to lose 27? Most people would think not. I don’t care. My boyfriend doesn’t think I look too thin yet hasn’t complimented me. He made me feel bad about myself when I gained weight. Now he still won’t help my confidence and at least say he’s proud I gained control and ate super healthy and exercised like crazy for two months. I didn’t even completely starve myself. Nothing is ever good enough for him. He complimented me all the time when I was rail thin. He doesn’t understand eating disorder stuff so I know he’s not shutting his mouth due to that. My mom said she can tell I’m “starving myself or over exercising again” but that’s it. Maybe I just wanted to hear the smallest of recognition for something I did work hard at for two months. I went way overboard in eating and lost control. I finally found discipline and lost it in just two months and a week and a half or so. 

Still though. I hate this disease. If someone says I’m smart it makes me happy. If someone says they’re concerned for my effing health I’m on cloud 9.

2719,dlcnvb,Loving my body at ALL stages,"I’m one of the people here who fights for recovery daily, weekly, monthly and yearly with uncontrollable relapses due to BPD and severe depression. I’m at a very low weight right now and it makes me really self conscious due to the pressure I feel to be voluptuous. Well no more! I’m loving my thin body and when I gain weight I will love that too! 

I’m coming out of a multi week depression.  I’ve been journaling a lot and that helps more than anything. I’ve done my hair, will do my nails and resume life as usual. I’m going to get out of the house and be social now that I’ve regained my confidence and I’m just very happy to be feeling like myself again. I’ve been praying a lot! Glory be to God! I’m so happy to be mentally happy more than anything. This body is a vessel and I just want to respect it by making myself healthy and thinking happy thoughts. I can’t believe I’m finally out of this terrible funk. Feeling back to myself is so wonderful. 

Terrible moments in life happen, but strengthening your mind during that time is the most important thing to do. Over these few weeks I’ve been doing all I can for myself such as eating of course. Which in the beginning I could only drink meal replacement smoothies until my appetite came back. I also read books in the park, spent time with family, and just took better care of myself overall by cutting out a lot of negativity and drama in my life. Some of the trash actually took itself out little did I know.

I really want all of you to love yourselves at all stages of this disease. If you are feeling bad just know as long as you want better eventually you will get better and be better! Whatever that is for you. 

I don’t have a goal weight or anything, but I do have a goal of consistent healthy eating,  healthy thinking and consistently taking care of myself. 

Never neglect yourself by worrying about someone else and their sadness or happiness. Never fall into thinking it’s someone else’s job to make you happy especially when they didn’t even volunteer to do that! It’s a recipe for disaster. Take care of yourselves. It’s not selfish and it’s not going to make you lonely. Quite the opposite. It’s makes you more attractive and valuable.",1571718574,10/21/2019 23:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dlcnvb/loving_my_body_at_all_stages/,0

I remember eating sweets in secret and then getting yelled for it even before 2013, but since that year one could say I was bulimic the whole time ’til 2016 when I moved out.

Moving out my ED turned towards Ednos, I still had some bulimic tendencies but the anorexic traits increased and increased. I still had somehow healthy periods as well. That is until a year ago.

A year ago I got into an abusive relationship and my disordered behaviour went completely anorexic, so you could say I’ve been (a-typical, so weight hasn’t been low enough to diagnose) anorexic for a year now. I’m beyond terrifyed of gaining weight and that takes us to the point of this post:

I’m visiting my mother for four days and I’m only binging like crazy! What to do when I only binge here?  At home I usually binge once a moth, here multiple times a day. Any tips how to stop this cycle? It must be an environmental trigger, but how do I stop myself when there are cookie- boxes and bags of chips lying all around this place?

2738,dkuip6,What the ??,"I gained a ton of weight over the past year and finally started losing. 

I lost 27 lbs. If my scale is accurate. Which means now I should be a size 2. 

I just tried on old clothes all excited because today on my scale I apparently hit a happier weight for me.

How the heck are size 8 jeans fitting me right now?? When I’ve apparently lost 27 lbs away from being a size 8. 

Then a pair of “double zero” jeans are fitting me the way they fit me when I first bought them, which was 7lbs heavier than I am right now??? 

Also a romper is fitting me the way it fit me 7lbs heavier than now. And a pair of shorts is fitting me the way they fit me about 5 lbs heavier. Thought those would be far looser as well.

Is my scale off? I thoight I looked (in the mirror) pretty close to the weight it’s telling me. Of course I didn’t think I looked exactly like it because I never think I look ok. But this is extremely frustrating and discouraging and annoying.

td;lr: I have lost 27 lbs and clothing that should be falling off me according to my scale and the way I look in the mirror (mostly) are fitting me the way they fit me 7-27lbs heavier just not quite as tight.",1571628219,10/20/2019 22:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dkuip6/what_the/,2

I ate it then went back to sleep after he went to work and when I weighed myself again I gained 3 lbs. I feel like a fuck up. I was already 2 lbs heavier than yesterday because I had a dinner with alot of sodium so now that's an extra 5 lbs.

I feel like such a disappointment, I was just starting to see progress and I fucked it all up in two days, now I can't eat dinner with my boyfriend because I was an idiot this morning and binged, I could of just said no but he's been starting to get worried about me. After all this time of him denying my eating disorder, when I relapse and he sees how bad it really is then he gives a shit.

I'm at a loss if I should eat dinner tonight and fast all day tomorrow or not eat for the next couple of days.  I know this sub isn't  pro-ana but honestly I'm at the point where I don't care to get better, especially when him and his mother have been poking at my weight.",1571425903,10/18/2019 14:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/djs9jh/had_some_food_from_starbucks_and_now_i_want_to_die/,3

2772,djrgsz,What Helped Me Eat Today,"I have a really hard time emotionally whenever I am about to eat and it’s just something that happens. 

Here’s what’s helped me and what has been helping me. 

I could not see myself eating. It was just a power that was beyond my personal humanly control, but today I made a big slice of lasagna and still could not see myself eating it. I often get repulsed by food. So I began to pray. Before, during and after I said this prayer and I’m almost done with this task. 

“Lord thank you for the food that I am about to consume for the nourishment of my mind, body and soul” 

I often feel a huge weight being lifted off of me when I pray and it’s something that I have been doing often and has most definitely been helping me. 


This is a simple prayer that we say before eating down south. I grew up hearing my grandmother say this prayer and over the years I’ve had a scant relationship with God, but no matter how far I stray God always accepts me back. I’m not religious so take that for what it’s worth. God hears all of us no matter your race, religion or past. 

I hope this helps whoever is reading this. This thing ain’t easy and it takes work. God doesn’t want us to work so hard alone when there’s such a powerful force there to help us only if we will call for help.

I told her I felt sick and she didn’t need to eat less because of me and she basically said, “now that you eat less than me, I feel like a larder.” 
She’s made more comments about herself being fat lately and expressed that she doesn’t want to eat because I’m not, which is kind of super stressing me out.

Yesterday was my birthday, I turned 21 years old. I try not to log calories but when I got home the food guilt hit and I added it all up. It was almost twice my BMR. 
And that's okay.

Today I have more energy than I have in months. The scale went up, but I know it's just water weight and will be gone soon. I got to eat my favorite foods with my favorite people. This morning I woke up, still painfully full, and I was still okay. I didnt die overnight. I didnt triple in size or end up disfigured like anorexia would have me believe. I woke up with enough nutrients to take a walk and do some light gardening without getting light headed. My hands and feat weren't cold and clammy, my legs didnt ache when I walked with exhaustion.

I cant say every day will be okay, but this feels like a step in the right direction. Today will be okay. And maybe tomorrow too.",1571398463,10/18/2019 6:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/djm6z9/i_ate_well_over_my_bmr_yesterday_and_thats_okay/,1

I've been ""in recovery"" from my anorexia for several years now. I'm putting that in air quotes because I was honestly never sure I really recovered.

I still split foods into good and bad. I still feel like I have to burn off or earn every bite of food I put into my mouth. I have a weight I won't let myself get under, but I also have a weight I won't let myself get over. Sometimes I intentionally get precariously close to my highest allowed weight just so I could restrict in peace for a while and pretend that I'm just ""being healthy"" and ""trying to lose a few pounds"".

basically the thing is i’ve struggled with eating throughout the years, never really got a proper diagnosis but i’m pretty sure i have experienced at least some sort of an eating disorder since i engaged in stuff like food intake restriction and purging

my bmi used to be 18.3 in 2016-2017 and now i’m at 20.6
and i haven’t purged in quite a substantial amount of time... until today

it’s so fucking conflicting cause i know what triggered it: it’s me getting really attached to this guy and us considering trying to get together and he’s gonna visit in about a month and right now i just feel super pressured to lose weight and get as skinny as possible until we meet

i made the stupid fucking mistake of eating a cursed bag of chips and after i did i just felt like i couldn’t have that in my body so i purged and after that i felt so pathetic because i know i shouldn’t be doing such toxic things to myself

it’s not like he made any comments about my weight or suggested that i lose weight, i just feel like i have to or he just won’t like me if i’m not skinny

i’m sad and confused and i don’t know what to do and i thought i’d come here for some advice and maybe hearing about some of your experiences

2808,dom523,What the last 6 years has taught me.,"Hey everyone. I'm a 24(F) and have suffered with anorexia since right after my 19th birthday in December.

I started college in August 2013 and I weighed 112 pounds at the height of 5'2. I was ABSOLUTELY disgusted with myself and started going to the gym regularly on campus, got into good shape. Around Thanksgiving I weighed around 107 so I didn't have major weight loss, was eating healthy, and keeping up on exercise.

Come December, my weight had stayed the same but my tonsils were removed. No big deal. I'll eat pudding, yogurt, popsicles. But for the first 3 weeks, I had such severe swelling I couldnt drink any liquids.
I ended up heading back to college in January of 2014 after my break. I still wasnt eating quite normally and thought it would be fine.

This is when I noticed my issue. I hopped on the scale one day cause my mom said I looked oddly thin. My weight came up at 94 pounds. The smallest I've been since middle school. This is when my downward spiral began. I was OBSESSED with the number on the scale. I would not let myself go above 97 pounds. I exercised consistently after seeing the number and anytime I ate or even drank WATER, I would go for a 8-10 mile run, 5-6x a week.

Feburary 2014 rolls around. (I was in an abusive relationship at this time and it may have been a huge factor). I was eating hardly anything by this point. I'd allow myself one nutrigrain bar for breakfast, a handful of cheerios for lunch, and some easy mac. (My calories averaged around 300-350 a day). At this time I wore a heart rate monitor strap anytime I worked out. So remember those 8-10 miles, I'd burn around 700+ calories. And if I didnt run, I'd do other cardio until I hit at least 600+ calories burned. Then it vot worse. I ate the same but my calories burned a day were skyrocketing to 1000+. I was never satisfied. I somehow managed to run a half marathon in April 2014 with a time of 2:00:17. After weeks of exercising and running for hours on end (would run at a 6.5-7.0 for 2 hours on a woodway desmo evo treadmill) so I ran about 13-14 miles for a couple weeks straight

It wasnt until a girl on my dorm called health (March 2014) right begire my half  when she knew something was wrong. They took me out of class and ran normal diagnostics. I had to stand backwards on the scale but I knew my weight from weighing earlier and I was at 98. They then checked my heart and how much it was pumping.. 47 bpm. I eventually learned my heart was working at 40% and my organs were beginning to fail on me.

I ended up finishing the school year and went to live back at home and go to a college near us. I joined the cross country team and had a solid weight of 115. I dead lifted 220. Squatted 250. Bench pressed 130. I felt strong, I felt happy.

I ended up leaving XC though and have had 3 ankle surgeries since. It's now October 2019. I weigh 147 and I'm disgusted. I cant fit any of my clothes. I'm depressed. I cant even workout as I'm getting ready for a 4th surgery and still in a boot from the 3rd surgery (2 each ankle). But all I can think about is how much I'm gonna start working out when I can. And I also go back to my job. I was so thin when I was working. 117 or so. And now I'm falling back into my old ways. I want to lose weight but I want to be back to 100 pounds, I want to look thin and muscular like I used to be.

And I think a lot of this stems from a recent breakup and how I no longer have stability in my life. (He also made sure I ate and was healthy.. but hes gone for the most part. I check in with him and my eating.. but I lie to him. I say i have pork chopsor spaghetti)I actually  hardly eat anymore and have lost 13 pounds since July (I was 160). And it's like, I don't DISLIKE food. But I'm fine with just drinking water or a diet soda for my meals and moving on with my day.

I feel once I'm released from my boot and physical therapy, everything from 2014 will come back to haunt me. I want to be super skinny again. I miss fitting in my clothes. I miss the time i felt happy although i was constantly tired, cold, shaking, and had severe vitamin and mineral deficiencies. I just don't know how to stop..

It's hard when someone else in my family is facing their own battle again and doing what I used to do. And it's like competition for me. Yes. I'm on a verge of relapse and I don't think anything but death will stop me. 🤷‍♀️ so hear I am again. But to this terrible disease and I cant imagine what sorcery may come once I'm working in the mornings, workout after, and feel no desire to eat.

6 years almost and this thing still ruins my life.",1572331766,10/29/2019 1:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dom523/what_the_last_6_years_has_taught_me/,4

2819,do3t57,I’m actually recovering.,"I’ve had an eating disorder for 6 years. My boyfriend, who I had previously basically lived with, went to college. 
Needless to say, things got BAD. They were already the worst theyd ever been due to the fact that I knew he was leaving and all that, so yeah. Bad. 
But then things got better and i gained some of the weight I lost, I put effort into it, and gained back almost 10 pounds of what I’d lost. 
Flash forward to a couple weeks after I’d hit the highest weight I’d had in almost a year, (a couple days ago), I found out that my boyfriend was also going to be away for the summer because he got a full time internship. That stupid smarty pants. Like I’m not even allowed to be upset for that because it’s fucking AWESOME. He’s a freshman in college getting a full time internship right? Awesome! 
However, my mind isn’t that simple. Along with knowing the fact that i wasn’t gonna have my boyfriend for the summer anymore (which to a codependent anorexic is a pretty big deal), i did the while comparing thing. I mean I’m at a community college for special education and he’s on a 40K scholarship and got a full time internship as A FUCKING FRESHMAN). I’m a recovering anorexic who needs a lot of control in her life. So yeah, the eating got bad. Like really bad. Again.
But I stopped myself from feeding into more negative thoughts. I’m an adult and I need to treat my problems like one, not starve myself because it makes me “feel better.”
Fuck that. 
Bottom line: it got better. My case of anorexia nearly killed me. But lapses DONT HAVE TO BE RELAPSE!!!!!! I’m DOING IT! 
And you can too!!

I’m sorry i wrote this all out, idk why i did, IVE literally never posted on here or really any other thread, but I just wanted to spread some hope and tell myself i did it !

I am not getting the response I expected. I am not being supported. These people are saying they don’t want to help. Or they’re overemphasizing it with way too too much praise which is just embarrassing for me.

I’m triggered and don’t feel safe and want to cry because I really don’t think I’m ready for this. At least not to this extent.

The bad thing is, my whole life WORKS in extremes. That’s who I’ve always been. I don’t know how to deal with things in a healthy “even keel” manner.

2823,dnzh6p,I'm so scared right now,"I don't really know how to start this one. I don't even know if I am a 'true' anorexic, but this little voice in the back of my mind keeps telling me that something's wrong with my mind and I won't stop this alone.

I've been dieting for around 3/4 of a year by now. I took it slow at the beggining, but I picked up the pace rather quickly. I've been eating around 1000-1200 calories a day for around four months and I don't think I will be stopping anytime soon. I see myself as overweight and have caught myself thinking about how I need to lose all that weight. In addition to eating too little, I exercise and purge, and because of those thought I'm having and tje way I act I've started to think that I may have an ED. I've always pushed these thoughts aside, because I thought (and still do think) that I am too fat and eat too much to be suffering. I wanted to tell someone that I think I may be suffering but I'm scared they will make me gain weight. But now I'm thinking that I could really use a doctor.
It feels like my body is giving up. I'm getting weaker every day, I can barely open the door to the cloakroom in my school, I have to push it with my whole body for it to budge, and I've seen others open it with no effort whatsoever. Last Thrursday, my mom had to pick me up early beacause I felt so bad I could barely stand or walk in a straight line. But the worst thing is that MY PERIOD IS FUCKING GONE. I thought that you lose your period when you are severly underweight, but here I am. 158 cm, 52 kilograms and no fucking period and I'm so fucking terrified I'm gonna die.",1572212196,10/27/2019 16:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dnzh6p/im_so_scared_right_now/,1

2828,dnr24v,Vent,"I’ve never been good at opening up about my issues and struggles and when I don’t I just simply breakdown. So I want to vent on here because maybe it will make me feel slightly better.
I’m  13 and for as long as I can remember I have loved everything sweet and sugary. When we went for walks in parks you knew I would get an ice cream. When an ice cream van would park outside my primary school on hot days I was always in that queue. Every year of my life since being months old me and my parents and loads of my parents friends and kids have gone on holiday to this campsite and whenever we’ve gone me and my friends have eaten so many cake and sweets we were constantly going in there and stuffing our faces. I used to be on a netball team and an athletes team in my primary school but since starting high school my motivation for exercise stopped and I didn’t exercise at all. And I kept on eating loads of sugar entire packs of Oreos, tonnes of Jaffa cakes, doughnuts and cookies. I would also eat entire packs of fruit. So I gained weight. My parents never told me I was overweight or unnaturaly big for my age. But I felt it and I still do. So not long ago I cut sugar out of my diet completely. I now have 10-12g of oats with a bit of milk for breakfast. A small fruit pot or half a small pot of nachos. And small dinners for example a fried egg with small strips of toast. I never snack and I only drink water. My belly has gotten flatter but I still feel fat. I listen to subliminals that make face not fat and one that reduces my appetite. And I exercise a lot for example on Friday I listened to BTS for 16 minutes and the entire time I was doing sit ups with two 10 second breaks and my ribs and stomach still hurt. Yesterday when I was at this bonfire and firework night when I was in the hut with all the food with my friend because she was buying something I felt so sick.I’m counting calories in everything I eat. I’m obsessed with this whole routine and diet. And I’m scared someone I know is going to find out😔.",1572168126,10/27/2019 4:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dnr24v/vent/,2
2829,dnphow,I'm afraid that I might have anorexia...,"Since the middle of 2018 my family has been making several statements about my weight and appearance. At first I didn't let the comments affect me and I usually just let it slide. Then, my relatives and a few of my friends have made similar remarks. It went as far as to insults. I started to feel really self-conscious about my image. Way more than I already did. I started to (and I still do) feel hatred and disgust towards myself. Earlier this year, my mother had a whole bunch of statements regarding my weight (she even made me jog a good mile a few times in the warmer seasons), my sisters had insulted me about it, and my dad says I'm gonna end up on *My 600 pound life* if I keep up my actions. Literally all my siblings have the same diet and lifestyle. I just look more fatter(?) than my sister who weighs more than me.

On the 29th of August I weighed 218 pounds and I think my mom felt disgusted at this. She scolded me on the way home and ranted at me and was like ""How are you 15 and weigh that much? You're so overweight and obese, you're gonna look like those people on TV by the time you turn 16!"" And honestly, that hurt my feelings. Real badly. So I think thats what triggered my spiral downwards.

It started off really simple. In the beginning of September I only started to avoid junk food and anything that was too fatty and had lots of sugar. I used to drink soda and caffeine-fueled drinks just to try and stay awake for school and just to get through the way in general. I realized that I drank to much and started to cut myself off from it. I thought its fine that I'm doing healthier choices in my diet.

The comments on my weight still persisted. I still thought I was extremely fat. In fact I still do.

The second week into September, I started to only eat up to 900 calories a day. I skipped breakfast and lunch and sometimes dinner. When I did have dinner, I didn't eat much for it.

That soon dropped to only 300-800 calories and me skipping dinner a lot. And I'm still following it.

Its now October 26th. I weigh 204.2 lbs and I lost 16 pounds in 2 months. My sisters noticed my change in eating and tried to tell my parents. They thought it was  good thing, so I did too. But now, I think this is unhealthy for me. But it became a habit I don't know how to break. I can't dig my way out of this and I don't know how to talk to anyone in my family about it and the way I feel about myself. I never really open up to my family members but I have talked to a friend about the situation and he doesn't know how to help. I'm not diagnosed with anything. And I kinda doubt my parents will take me to a doctor about it. I really don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Basically my family left a severe mark on my self-esteem and it turned into something else.

2831,dno25a,I have no one to talk to about this so yeah,"This is just a huge vent about everything

Some backstory. I’ve been overweight basically my whole life. I tried starving for the first time my freshman year of high school and lost +20lbs but then fell out of it and went back to eating. Since then I’ve continued to have a really unhealthy relationship with food, either binging or skipping meals. In August, I was very obese and disgusted with myself.

However, in August I started skipping breakfast and lunch and eating small dinners (had to eat with my family). Then in mid August I started college out of state and spiraled out of control because I was by myself and no one could make me eat. Now I eat maybe once a week and I’ve lost over 20% of my body weight. No longer obese, but still overweight. Essentially I want to lose another of what I just lost and then some.

I feel tired all the time, I have trouble sleeping, I no longer have the energy to go up two flights of stairs, etc. Also it’s like my emotions are just gone for some reason. Like I have emotions but I don’t cry or have emotional reactions to things, I think I’m just to mentally and physically exhausted from it all.

I isolate myself. I’ve made one friend here since I’ve been at college but 90% of my time is spent by myself, starving.

I’m worried about going back home for Thanksgiving break when my family sees me for the first time since losing all the weight. I have to somehow dodge birthday cake and thanksgiving meals. I’m not even sure how I want them to react. I don’t want them to find out that I’m starving myself. But at the same time what if they are supportive and congratulate me on it, completely oblivious to what I’ve been putting myself through?

2843,dnc3j4,Slipping. ~TW~,"Hi. I just need to ramble for a little as I have a lot on my mind and I think this will help.

 I'm not diagnosed with anything mainly due to family circumstances and lack of trust in doctors plus just generally not feeling like they will believe me. But I have been struggling with disordered eating for about nine years now so I'm just wanting to admit it really. I do my best to keep this a secret and very little people close to me know about it, but I think some have suspicions. Anyway since I started high school I started hating the way I looked and started to believe I was fat after seeing myself in pictures etc so I started lying that I'd eaten, starving myself and throwing away my school lunches.

This continued throughout the whole of school in various forms, obsessing over my weight, crying at the scales, starving myself, calorie counting, always trying to be smaller, baggy clothes to hide it. Fear of food and eating with people. Ultimately convinced that I was so fat. I was so underweight.

In college this continued, I would lie about my food consumption, having at most one small meal a day and I refused to snack. Every day would be spent hungry and obsessing over my food control. When I look at pictures now I was grey, skeletal, and look so sick. My head was a mess I was disassociating and convinced I wasn't existing. Paranoid, confused and full of repulsion for myself. I'd punish myself for eating and starve myself incessantly.

Then at uni it progressed. Living on my own gave me freedom to do this and I started to become more sick. Crying all the time about how fat I was, not being able to show my body, and substituting every meal with coffee or tea and if I had to eat it would be one specific meal that I had thought through for the purpose of my weight loss. 

I would sit shaking for hours trying to stop thinking about food because I was so hungry but I couldn't let myself eat. I was getting dizzy to the point I passed out. I would hurt myself for wanting food and pace about debating all sorts of food, looking at recipes which I could basically taste and that was as good as eating. I stopped sleeping because I was so hungry. 
People had started to notice. I'd got myself hugely underweight and I was going crazy. Docs put me on meds.. 

It's been a little while now. I've been good to myself the meds have made me put on weight although my relationship with food is very rocky. I have been getting a little better with the support of people around me and have gained weight. I had to have people with me whilst I cooked and stay with me whilst I ate it. But I got back to a semi normal although always feeling guilty.

Now it's coming back. The urge for control and the urge to lose what I've gained. I feel stupid for letting myself get like this and like I was never even sick at all. I  am restricting again, I am pacing again debating whether to eat, I am controlling my meals and calories and I am hating myself for every bit of food I consume.

Luckily this time I have no scales. But fuck, it's starting to eat away at me again (unintentional pun lol) and I hate myself for it. I just hate the fact I'll have to admit it to people again. I don't want to be more weak, tired, paranoid, depressed and anxious than I already am, nevermind the sickness and dizziness that comes with it.... But I want to be skinny and this is stupidly fair to me. 

I know how irrational this is. I just don't know how to stop these thoughts because I need to do some uni work and I can't even concentrate because I'm trying to not feel the hunger so when I eat it's later and then I eat less in the day.

Any advice? I just needed to get that out as I don't think I've ever vented this much about it in so much detail.",1572085317,10/26/2019 5:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dnc3j4/slipping_tw/,0

2860,dmr2cu,Today was just... not good.,"It’s like I couldn’t control myself. Drinking calories from several coffees, a slice of cake, a bite of cheese dip, a whole ass fast food dinner. I purged for the first time in a few weeks, and sitting here with the guilt I feel over what I ate is miserable.  

I’m already thinking of how much I’m going to have to restrict to make up for this, and I have plans that involve dinner tomorrow night... I hide my ED from all but a select few people so I don’t know what I’m going to do. I hate myself right now. I know I need help, I’ve agreed to get help, and I’m waiting on insurance to kick in so I can start an IOP.  

But no matter how miserable I am, a lot of the time I don’t want help. I’m at a normal BMI right now so you can’t tell by looking at me that there is a problem. But I desperately want to lose more weight. I used to be obese, and that’s what I still see in the mirror, what I used to look and feel like. And I never want to be that version of myself again.

I feel like no one understands what it’s like to be in my head and it gets very lonely. The daily struggle is exhausting. I’m just so tired of all of this, but I’m also tired of people trying to stop me. It’s gotten to the point where there have been moments that I’ve felt like it would be better if I wasn’t even here anymore. I haven’t felt like that in a long time. Maybe tomorrow will be better, but I honestly doubt it.",1571971132,10/24/2019 21:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dmr2cu/today_was_just_not_good/,2

2875,dsgy1i,“Well at least it’s not as serious as bulimia”,"Wtf coworker-I-really-like-and-have-confided-in-and-is-also-a-nurse! I’m a bartender and have struggled with AN for over a decade. My server and friend last night had a table of two girls, one of whom was absolutely TINY. If she didn’t have an ED, I’ll eat my hat. Seriously, I out loud gushed over this girl’s tiny legs and we both watched her leave. 

For context, my coworker is a bigger gal but everyone, including myself, thinks she’s hot because, well, she is! Curvy legend! But she isn’t happy with herself so she talks about her dieting tactics a lot.

I confided in her about my ED almost 2 years ago and she’s normally very supportive. But last night when I told her about a regular of ours that I heard purging in the bathroom stall next to me one night, another skinny legend, she said ohhh maybe an allergy or maybe an eating disorder?!? 

Yeah obviously a fucking eating disorder, come on. So I said “I know what’s going on, you know I know those behaviors all too well” and she said “don’t you dare, I’ll kill you if you start throwing up” and here’s the kicker...

“I said oh no, that’s not my method, lol, I hate throwing up and I’ve never really been bulimic” 

And she replied with “good because that’s way worse definitely don’t do that”

Fantastic, starving isn’t valid, I don’t “need to lose weight”, and I feel like my trust in my friend was betrayed. I did so many shots last night after that lol total fear food but I was upset.

Essentially I failed because I skipped too many classes. I wouldn’t attend because I was not an amazing student &amp; also felt too fat to be a tolerable dumb. Like either you are skinny &amp; not the brightest/ or smart as hell.. and still skinny

Anyhow now I’m living back at home and this huge failure makes me want to starve myself
I admitted to my mother &amp; brother that I was abusing drugs— and their hurt and disappointment makes me want to kill myself 

And being back at home i slowly started listening to same ass songs that accompanied throughout my worst depression years 
Started watching all these movies &amp; shows I was obsessing over.. I feel like I’m a teenager all over again. And this time I want to prove the world I will be gods skinnier than all of them
And that I don’t need food
And that I’m not a failure


And I don’t even know what this post is about anymore but god help me I will be skinny",1573021127,11/6/2019 0:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dscah7/im_twenty_feel_like_im_13_again_tw/,4
2880,dsc0jh,Recovery/ Minnie Maud,"Ok so here’s the deal. TLDR @ the end. 
I’ve decided; for about the 50th time, to commit to real recovery. I want to make it last this time. I want to ignore the feelings of failure that go alongside eating more, gaining weight and feeling emotions intensely again, because that’s always what slips me up. I have a good treatment team - an ED specialising dietician, weekly/fortnightly trauma therapy, an ED specialising psychiatrist and a GP who is always willing to help whatever way he can. Support wise, I think I’m set. I don’t feel ready. But I never have, and I likely never will. I recognise that. I recognise that what has allowed me to make ED related concessions in the past is allowing myself to act on impulses and urges that turn back into habits and compulsions. I acknowledge that motivation for recovery is never going to be consistent in intensity and that I’m going to have to keep pushing through regardless. 
But I’m terrified. I want to throw up even thinking about it. I’ve read countless articles and references regarding the Minnie Maud approach to recovery and, although I’m very conflicted, wary and unsure, I genuinely think it’s the best way to go.
But I’m 24. I’ve been counting calories since I was 12. Half my life. I’ve been in a constant flux of losing and then gaining and then losing weight since I was 13. I don’t know how to not control my intake. I don’t know how to trust my body. I don’t know how to accept weight gain in an outpatient setting that isn’t family based therapy. Where I am wholly accountable to myself and only myself. 
When confronted by the idea of gaining weight, none of the dreams I have for my life seem to matter as much because all I want in that moment is for the numbers to go in the other direction.
What do you guys think of Minnie Maud? How do you actually stop counting calories when it’s been your entire life for half your life? If you’re in recovery, how do you keep going despite waning motivation?
This is the first time I’m verbalising (writing, but still) my NEED to get better for GOOD this time and even now I want to backspace everything and pretend the thought hasn’t occurred to me. 

TLDR: I want to try Minnie Maud or some other kind of nutritional rehabilitation, I’ve had AN half my life now and even though I’ve researched I don’t know how to 1) start it, and 2) stick to it.

2888,ds430y,"My wife is deep in a relapse and we have no options, I don't know how to stay sane and support her. I just want her to have the help she deserves.","My wife is anorexic, and I try very hard to be as supportive and encouraging as I can. She is relapsing extremely bad and she has no health insurance and though she's in therapy, the therapist has absolutely no experience with Eds. I try so hard to listen, and support, and be a positive influence when I'm able. I always remember that she is the one going through this, not me. 

But y'all, I am fucking terrified. Last year my wife had a very similar pattern of relapse which ended in inpatient treatment and medical stabilization, but now that is not an option as far as I can tell. 

She has this awful voice inside her, a monster and it's becoming so vocal that sometimes when we talk I can see that her eating disorder is talking to me, not her. The coldness and hatred of herself is so loud and clear and it breaks my heart. I tell her every day in every way how wonderful and kind and good and worthy she is of love and of food. That she doesn't deserve to suffer. That she will still be a great student if she doesn't have an eating disorder, and that no one will judge her or think she was lying about her eating disorder once she is in recovery. (These are reminders she has asked me to vocalize in order to help her)

Y'all I feel like I do BATTLE every single day - not as much as she does, bless her, cuz that voice ain't in my head, but... I have no idea what to do. I'm a wreck. I knew when we started dating, hell I knew when I was even CONSIDERING dating her that there was a chance she could die... And I accepted that risk, and I still do. I've told her time and time again that no matter what I will be by her side. But I don't want to lose her. She is a goddamn beautiful soul, a fuckin princess, my soul mate. I love her and I don't want to see her in pain, and I don't want to watch helplessly.

2900,drrvzs,Currently struggling with my recovery AND have to sit thru a three hour long class about ED tomorrow,"I have struggled with AN and also binge eating on and off for about ten years now. I was doing great for awhile but in the past month or two have been really struggling with the additional stress of starting grad school. 

I’m in a clinical psychology PhD program and I’m in a class where we discuss a different mental illness every week. Tomorrow is eating disorders. 

I read the five assigned articles and they were all very triggering and upsetting to me, especially since I have not been doing so well lately. This is a three hour discussion class with only 6 students and there is no way I can miss it. 

I don’t even really know the purpose of this post other than the fact that I have no one else to talk to about this, I have already tried reaching out to my best friend (the only person who knows about my ED) but she was not helpful at all, and I’ve been considering talking to my boyfriend about it but we’ve only been together a few months and he knows nothing about this yet, and I don’t want to worry him. 

I just need other people who understand this feeling, because all I can do is sit in my anxiety thinking about class tomorrow morning ):


UPDATE: it was awful but I survived. I feel like I wasn’t even listening for half the class and definitely didn’t participate in discussion but it still wasn’t as bad as I was making it out to be in my head. I just took a lot of time to myself afterwards and am relaxing tonight.

2925,dr7lvs,Vent hours,"I’m Oscar and I’m 16 and from Gurnee Illinois. I run track and cross from my school and I kinda wanna detail where it went or why it’s going wrong. It started in 7th grade and I wanted to loose weight. I was 200 pounds and I did it to feel good about myself and over the summer after intense games of tag and clean eating, I managed by 8th grade weigh 138 and I was beyond happy cause that’s like impossible almost but it’s true. Everything was well especially cause everyone actually gave me attention and recognized and congratulated me. As the year went by I met or became friends with someone and he wore on me cause he tried to kill himself and was always so negative so I never slept cause I feared that his life would be taken. I eventually became obsessed with perfection for him, I felt like I needed to do everything prefect to save him, as time went by I actually met a girl and we had the worse relationship ever and the summer after 8th and during 9th she cheated on me. 9th grade was the year I definitely put weight back on but I was contempt cause hey I needed it which I wasn’t gonna lie and it was a good year cause I met a girl who I am still with named Annabelle(if I can post a pic of us, I will) last year in 10th everything went well and I thought I had it all until October in which me and my gf broke up cause I felt trapped. We made up but in the meanwhile a girl who I thought was our friend was trying to manipulate me to date her but I refused, the mistake I made was not telling my girlfriend cause she had always suspected her being fishy. She was right and December is when she found out and that absolutely tore her, the way she looked just destroyed my world and I soon became obsessed with how I looked and acted. 159 to 142 in two weeks. In Jan, I started track and I will post pics. I did the training and it was an amazing way to just get rid of those evil thoughts I had but even then I felt guilt, I felt so insecure. I thought that she would leave and it was ironic that our roles switched. Time goes by and yes things get better but over the summer I was scared of loosing progress so I ran more and ate less. I now sit at 130 pounds and I’m 6’1. My routines aren’t the best, I usually burn about 800 calories daily but my diet is apples and coffee and water. It got worse cause my girlfriend and I haven’t been having the best year, it’s hard with both of us being busy and we’ve been fighting and I hope this Monday that I can make it up, I’m going to hug her and tell her how lost I’d feel without her. My eating disorder is affecting everyone, eating less and I forgot to mention I do what’s called chew and spit to not gain weight.",1572818921,11/3/2019 16:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dr7lvs/vent_hours/,4

2927,dr586m,My masochistic brain,"I “used to be” actively anorexic.
I had a goal weight and over the last 2 years, I’ve gone past it.
Most of me is has usually been worried about the dropping numbers, and I don’t even have big body image issues anymore, but that part of my brain that loves being injured or sick. (trust me I don’t go looking for injuries, when they happen I just get satisfaction out of it)
But lately I haven’t been denying the smile that wants to form when I see the scale.
My goal weight was reached entirely by accident.
Over the years I wrecked my appetite and relationship with food, so even though I haven’t been actively restricting, I just didn’t want any.
But now I’m starting to restrict again, and I just don’t know what to do.
I have neurological problems that could get worse from this, but I don’t care.
I want to be sick, I want to be skin and bones.
But at the same time I know that logically I need the exact opposite.
Point being, I’m not sure if my eating disorder is back since it’s so off and on. I can’t tell if it’s active anymore. 
I’m not sure if this is part of underlying generally weird as hell masochism or just an eating disorder.
It’s like I’m fighting with my brain every day and I’m sick of wanting to be sick. 
I’m starting to form a new goal weight in the back of my mind, and I just don’t know what to do about it.
These problems don’t consume my life like they used to, but I’m afraid they’re going to soon.


Also if there are any rules I have violated, or if this needs a trigger warning, please tell me so I can fix them.
I avoided using specific numbers but I’m not sure if numbers are generally frowned upon here.",1572808883,11/3/2019 13:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dr586m/my_masochistic_brain/,0

2941,dqtgvz,Ever since I got diagnosed with anorexia restricting and fasting seems way easier and weight loss more attainable and I'm stressed over it,"It almost feels like motivation to lose weight. I'm at a party right now with my boyfriend and my brother both of whom I confided in about my diagnosis and so now I feel stronger than ever like I cant eat. Because if I do, they'll think ""what the hell I thought she was anorexic."" 

I feel like an imposter carrying this diagnosis while not being underweight so it's just triggered me to try to lose as much weight as I can. My first outpatient appointment is in two weeks and I want to lose at least 10 pounds by then and I feel more than ever like I know that I can do it.

It's never been this effortless before and that's terrifying to me. Like nothing has ever motivated me this much to stop eating. I had been finding it harder and harder to restrict and had been b/p more but now I feel like I have a huge sign on my forehead that says ANOREXIC and if I eat I fuck it up and people (including my outpatient team) will judge me. I have to make my diagnosis proud, in a way.

This is so fucked up and I dont know how I'm not just going to miserably fail recovery with this going on in my head. It seems impossible. 

I dont know what to do because my urge to eat is completely gone now. Like never before",1572742725,11/2/2019 19:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dqtgvz/ever_since_i_got_diagnosed_with_anorexia/,2

Every morning when I step on the scale and see I've lost even .3 pounds I feel nothing but happiness and I dont want the feeling to stop.

So I started this new full time job. I’m  not sure if I’m making the right choices. My new full time job is not super different from my last one but is different. I worked privately alone for a whole year and now going back to a company is kinda different.

I’m not sure if this is a popular opinion or nah but I hate that I get so much anxiety about eating at work. I especially hate the idea of others seeing me eat and just eating in general at work. I hate that I can’t even enjoy 1 cheese ball or a slice of pizza.

Around lunch time everyday my co-workers ether look at me like I have 6 heads or ask me a million questions. About why I won’t eat like “oh I’ve actually never notice you eating here do you not bring a lunch bc or  anything?” or “why don’t you eat are you sick?” and my favorite one that I got today is “oh please don’t tell me your one of those anorexic bitches that think there so much better than everyone else because there so skinny.” which I’m sorry but you don’t say that to someone you’ve only known for a week you don’t even say that to someone you’ve known for your whole life. It’s someone’s personal business and I just feel like those comments aren’t work professional. 

I just especially feel like  its awkward and this is the biggest issue I have that holds me back in recovery and it’s really starting to effect me and I have no clue how to handle this kind of situation since I back out from recovery programs and everything to get this job and I just feel like I have no idea how to recover by myself with this problem.

My dr in treatment still has me listed as EDNOS even though I’ve fit the DSM requirements the entire time I’ve been here and it’s been fueling weight loss. Not only that but I just “graduated” to intensive outpatient so I have more freedom to do my fuckshit :( 

It’s not the primary purpose I’m there (suicidality/BPD) but I’m getting bent out of shape over this. I’m not a healthy weight! I haven’t -been- a healthy weight in over six months! I even asked him about it and he was like “anorexic? Not quite.” It’s out of control. I fit moderate severity guidelines 🤦🏻‍♀️ They’re not really fucking -debatable-. How am I supposed to take it seriously and get well when no one’s acknowledging the problem?

Not only that but (I’m so sorry if I’m offending or hurting anyone by saying this) NEDA seems to have forgotten about underweight sufferers altogether. Health at every size? Well OKAY! Then I’m good being the weight -I- wanna be, right? Do the rules not apply to me? I understand advocating for average weight or overweight sufferers, I’ve been there. But it -is- atypical anorexia — it IS EDNOS/OSFED. Should it be changed? Yes! But it hasn’t yet and I’m really tired of so and so being anorexic and my doctor not acknowledging that I meet the strict requirements for it. So do I have to lose even more weight? They don’t even weigh me so I must -look- fat. Is this why we have the highest mortality rate?

I kind of relapsed even though i still eat normally but mentally my eating disorder is going strong. I only eat in the morning and then desperately try to stay under 700kcal. 

Anyway, i was getting ready for school and started picking my outfit for the day. I picked a skirt with leggings and a purple shirt. There isn't a day in which i don't look at my legs.. and every time i pass some kind of shop/ or anywhere i can see my reflection my eyes momentarily shoot to my legs. 

I also have body dysmorphia so thats great. The only way I can explain it - I see different versions of myself in different windows or every other day. I figured it out when in a period of two weeks I restricted a lot but would constantly see my legs fat then one day while waiting for the bus i saw my reflection and my legs looked like sticks and i lost it. I got so scared and panicked.

I've never really sought for help and I somehow manage to help myself eventually. As of right now I'm 56kg probably/163cm. 

I really liked my outfit but I started to think in my head things such as:
 "" If you get thinner it would look better."" 
"" Your face does not fit anything you wear"" 
"" You look awful"" 
"" You are ugly"" 
""Skinny legs make everything look better"" 
""If you lost weight maybe your ugly face would change"" 

.. and more nonsense. 

And in the end I changed with something I feel more comfortable ( the same pair of jeans I wore yesterday) and I'm extremely mad that I let it get to me..

&amp;#x200B;

I've been having a lot of trouble lately, I have been doing really good the last few years when it comes to my self image but the last couple months or so I've started getting back into my old self destructive mindset. I started noticing that I was getting a little bit of a belly pooch and a lot of my pants stopped fitting me which destroyed my confidence. I'm too busy to go to the gym a lot of the time like I would like so I told myself I would stop eating as much junk food in the hopes of just losing a little bit of weight. But now I'm at the point where I'm only eating once a day, or a couple bites of something at a time throughout the day, just enough to make my stomach stop growling so much. I hate that I'm like this and I don't want to get to the unhealthy level I was at a few years ago but I don't know to make myself eat again without feeling like shit. I know I shouldn't feel guilty for eating but every time I eat something big I have this image in my head of me becoming this fat and greasy person that doesn't know when to stop eating and it's really scary. I wish I could get past that because I was doing so good just prior to a couple months ago but I feel like now I'm stuck in this loop of hating myself for eating a lot and not wanting to be pudgy but also not wanting to get too unhealthy (as far as the e.d. goes).

3009,dv4jdf,Im so frustrated bc of my eating habits,"Today I started the day by having a fruit smoothie with milk in it because my mom was home and I didn’t want her getting suspicious or anything, this first of all was breaking two of my ‘rules’ because I don’t let myself eat breakfast 99% of the time. The other rule is with milk, because it’s so calorie dense (about 130kcal per 8oz) so I try to avoid it as much as possible. Because I had breakfast I wasn’t going to have lunch. So it comes time for lunch, and my friend usually drives us to her house to eat, but I usually don’t eat or barely eat anything. So we go over there and she says “we can go to the gas station and get drinks after this if you hurry up.” So I think, ‘oh this is perfect I can just say I won’t eat so we have time’ but then she was like no you gotta eat. So I was telling her how I ate a big breakfast and I’m not hungry, but I still ended up having to eat a few pizza rolls. Then after we went to the gas station, and I got, you could probably guess a zero calorie diet soda. The end of the day comes and the same friend decides she wanted to go to an ice cream shop, so one again, dairy, high calories, I was stressing. So I got the smallest order of the lightest ice cream available. At the very end of the day it’s dinner time (the one meal I usually allow myself). My mom tells me she’s cooking food, which I was not too happy about because I was hoping she wouldn’t cook so I wouldn’t have to eat. She made a seafood dinner with garlic bread and salad. Keep in mind that whenever I eat with my parents they expect me to fill my plate. So I get my food and at this point I’m kind of really stressed out and feel like s*** for eating so much food through the day, which turned the meal into a ‘binge’. I got two servings of salad and seafood dish, with 2 pieces of garlic bread, and to finish it off I had a giant piece of cheesecake with cherries. Now I’m laying in bed just regretting everything, I would purge, but I’ve only done that twice and i really just can’t handle it. Now I don’t really don’t know what to do, I want to fast tomorrow, and work out a lot right now, but it’s late. Chances are my fast will somehow get messed up which I’m really hoping it doesn’t. Anyway I hope anyone reading this is having a good day/night/morning/ or whenever they’re reading this. If you have similar habits or experiences please feel free to share them below, right now i feel like I’m the only one who had this happen.

3010,dv4i23,I think my boyfriend has an ED too,"Hey dudes. I'm 21, I've had body image issues as long as I can remember, and an ed for at least 7 years. Underweight for the first time ever as of June. 

     I started seeing my boyfriend at the end of March, hes 22. I sort of knew him in highschool, not well, he was always very thin, always wore big sweaters. And he is seriously gorgeous, long, honey coloured hair, high cheekbones, full lips, beautiful eyes. Sweet and shy and kind. I quickly realized he is super insecure about himself, especially his body. He often asks if I think he's fat. He is FULLY CONVINCED he has a small dick but daaaamn absolutley not, not even close. I realized how thin he really is, if you tried to pinch him, you couldn't. He has almost no muscle. 

     At first I was stoked when we started hanging out because he never suggested us getting food, then I got worried because we would hang out all weekend and he wouldn't eat. Neither of us would eat, just occasionally, ""Are you hungry?"" ""No, are you?"" ""No."" Recently he came home from work at 7pm, said he had eaten already, didnt eat until he started puking up nothing the next afternoon. I stopped hiding my food issues so much and about a month ago we were drunk and I said, ""I think you have the same thing with food as I do"" and he said, ""yeah, I think I do"" and we didn't bring it up again. Lately he's been offering me food regularly and suggesting things for me to eat, which I'm sure you all know is stressful to have someone do to you. I'm having a hard time because my heart hurts for him, I want him to be healthy, I want to feed him, and at the same time I hate suggesting food because then I might have to eat too. It looks like he might be struggling with that as well, he seems nervous when he tries to give me something. 

     I want to help him, I want to support him. I don't want to get better and I'm being a hypocrite. I don't know if I should just bring this all out and we could talk about it together, I'm not quite sure what to do here. What do you think?

Being a British teenager, the doctor has referred me to CAMHS (children adolescent mental health services). Camhs rang me earlier to tell me they will review my case soon. My friends say my problems are extremely serious and they think it’s certain that camhs will send me to a mental health institute. My question is, knowing the mental health services will review my case soon then will likely send me to receive help, how long do I have until I become an inpatient? Do I have a week? A month? 3 months? If you’re comfortable talking about it, please share any experiences.

They were all very understanding and didn't freak out when I told them what I'd actually been eating and how I'd truly been feeling. The relief is... unimaginable. Just to finally not be alone in this anymore is such an incredible feeling. They even agreed to not pressure me into eating. But of course at the same time, they ominously told me they couldn't let me starve myself either. My mom asked if I could maintain. She recognizes that recovery has to be wanted for it to work. Being forced to gain weight would only make everything worse. I told her I'd think about the notion of maintaining, but in honesty I know I can't do that. I KNOW I can't do that. I've been able to allow myself a small boost in my daily calorie count, but that's seriously--that's all I can do. The topic of counseling came up, which I think will help so much. But maintaining when I haven't even achieved my GW, let alone my UGW... I know I can't do that. Like, *physically* I can't do that. Does anyone else experience that sort of feeling?

Recently, however, I've been experimenting with going vegan, and I've found that, on days when I eat purely vegan, the urge to check packets for calories disappears, and I can eat functionally. I feel guilty though, part of me feels like eating vegan is my brain's way of ""trading off"" one diordered habit for another.  Is this healthy?

3077,dtcy86,body issues,"TW: abuse, drugs, drinking, ed mention, ranting/venting, suicide mention, self harm etc. not sure what else to put, but i won’t give hard details on anything mentioned above. and if this post isn’t allowed, i will gladly take it down. 

so, i wish i knew how to start this off but i don’t. the beginning seems like a good place to start, so yeah. disclaimer: it’s 12:53am and i just spent too long looking at myself in the mirror after a shower. also i am very sarcastic in nature, and wouldn’t recommend reading if you’re not in for the long haul. 

i was a pretty decent kid from what my memories allow. pretty much always laughing or smiling, reading a book, playing dress up with my cat, or just simply laying on my bedroom floor and staring up at the popcorn ceiling, pointing out indescribable shapes to my imaginary friend. 

i went through some rough stuff as a kid too, don’t get me wrong, i had my fair share of “boyfriends”, “break ups” and whatever, but i also had a lot on my plate even back then. see, i was the result of an unwanted/unexpected teen pregnancy, but not your typical 16 and pregnant. my mother was 14, and my father, 13. fun eh?

sorry i use sarcasm and sardonic humor as a really bad coping method. anyways, i didn’t really know my bio dad a whole lot as a kid, only meeting him in three instances, one of which gave me a permanent burn scar on my foot and aggressive Acrophobia (fear of heights)

so anyways, my mother did as all moms do, her best. don’t get me wrong, i get my mom struggled a lot trying to juggle a kid and school and whatnot, but that lead into a whole other bout of issues pertaining me that i’ll crack into later on. 

anyways, get used to that word cause it’s a great and my favorite transition word, she found a guy with whom she later had (4) children with. not to go into tooo much detail cause i wanna remain vaguely anon on here, but he was an alcoholic, drug user, who used to frequently hit and abuse my mother or me at any opportunity seen fit. 

now, before she had gone back to this pos when i turned 8-9ish? maybe? per chance? who knows. my memories are kind of like scrambled eggs after you get done swirling ‘em. 

anyways from ages 6-8 or whatever, life was good. cut back to paragraph two. i had buried the first bout of trauma down so low that i never thought about it, until i had random flashes of vaguely discernible faces or places. 

i’m not making much sense am i? it’s alright. i don’t even know what i’m saying half the time. but anyways, cut forward to being an alright age to actually remember everything that i went through. the fights, the yelling, the smacks, the threats. all of it. 

turned me from a happy go lucky kid, to a shy, scared, and easily crying preteen, to an angry, self loathing, sadistic teenager. (psst, this is also the part of the story where my ed developed)

so my mother has always been on the petite side from doing sports as a kid, i, however, did not and am not. i am 5’2, and 150ish lbs. but when i was a teenager whoooo. top tier 👌🏼. i often got comments from my mother about my weight, my grades, my hobbies, my whatever. anything my mother could criticize, she would. 

this lead me into turning down a dark path of drinking, being out late and doing some 🧢🐭💩 (that’s supposed to be a hood, but don’t worry about it) i started to internalize a lot of things and believed the nasty things my mother was saying. 

maybe i was lazy, maybe i was fat, maybe my friends really didn’t like me, maybe i was a waste of space, maybe i did ruin her life, etc. this lead me to over obsessing on my appearance but also not caring at all. 

i would worry about my weight and not eat, but then eat so much just to spite her, honestly i did a lot of things to spite my mother for doing some of the things that she did to me, but will never take responsibility for. 

this kind of behavior lead me to developing an*rexia and bi*ge ea*ing disorder. i would hate who i was, stop eating, lose weight, get yelled at, eat until i got sick, and then hate myself all over again. it was a vicious cycle that i wish i could go back and stop myself from falling into. i fell to about 110ish pounds? and then would bounce back up to 130, back and forth as the cycle got worse and worse. 

i wish i could tell past me that drinking a whole bottle of jack to yourself in your room at midnight and crying about something that your mom said about you being your back to your stepdad in the garage below your room where she thought you wouldn’t hear wouldn’t matter once you moved out on your own, but honestly, if i could do that, past me wouldn’t of believed that i made it this far. 

i put up with so much criticism from my mother that i can’t even bare to have the lights on in the bathroom when i shower, even now as an adult, because all i can hear is her voice picking at how big my stomach is, how my thighs tough now when they didn’t used to. i can hear her brag about how small and dainty she is while telling me that i eat everything in the house and that’s why they can’t have snacks in the cabinet anymore. 

i know i’ve gotten better, i don’t binge eat anymore or skip meals, but sometimes i miss being how small i was when i had someone constantly chastising me for even existing. is it bad of me to miss that pressure on me to do better and be better? 

i look at myself in the mirror and just bring myself so down because i hate how my body looks, how i can’t wear certain clothes and feel comfortable or confident because i feel too big, how my breast are too big and hang down further than they used to, how my face is fatter now, how my hair is still too many different lengths from when i shaved it off at 3am in the downstairs bathroom of my parents house before i moved out. 

i can’t avoid my mother because i care about my younger siblings, but every time i see her i’m brought back to when i was a teen and how nothing i did was good enough or is still not enough for her.

i’m not really sure why i venting this all out online, but i think it helped to just air out my frustrations. i can’t explain to my boyfriend why i cry about a pair of pants not fitting like they used to because he just tells me that i look fine the way that i am. it just hard to want to move on from being how much of a  scared, angry, self and world hating teenager, and just be okay now as an adult. 

i know that my boyfriend means well with his comments and reassurances, but sometimes i just wish he could understand you know? but anyways this is wonderwall. 🎶

3092,dstn8u,A Guide On How To Recover,"1. Do not fear the weight gain. Even this is extremely hard for me to say because there are days where I think I look fat and unworthy
2. ALWAYS Remember why you are recovering— family, health and friendships are the most common reasons why people recover. 
3. Recovery is best done with other people that are very food positive. It is more likely that you will succeed if you eat with others that are NOT PICKY about 1. Types of food 2. Food portions, and eat “normal portions”
4. Do not be afraid of eating more. Your body was severely malnourished and needs to regain its previous status. 
5. Recovery doesn’t mean you immediately switch to eating fried and unhealthy foods, it also doesn’t mean binging on Uber healthy Low calorie foods. It means taking your time and pushing your boundaries slowly. Some days you can have fried foods, some days not. What matters is you LISTEN TO YOUR BRAIN and honour your hunger. You will encounter binge-like episodes, but that’s totally normal too. [do not purge during this period. You are not binging or losing control. You are regaining your health]
*Of course, there are exceptions to this rule if you are SEVERELY malnourished and need intensive rehabilitation 
6. Remember the extreme effects of Anorexia. Even if you are not Super skinny, have not lost your period or experience any other symptoms, THEY WILL COME EVENTUALLY. AND THEY WILL GET WORSE THE LONGER YOU LEAVE THIS PROBLEM UNTREATED
7. Do not fear failure: you cannot experience a 360 degree lifestyle change. slowly work your way into eating proper meals, then proper FDOE. 
8. Your body needs time to recover. You cannot expect to go from NOTHING to 5000 cals a day. Your stomach will not be physically able to handle it after staying in it’s shrunk state for so Long
9. Find worth in yourself. You are worth recovery and you don’t have to want be skinny anymore. You don’t have to be. 
10. Admit that you have a problem: chances are, if you’re browsing through anorexia forums all the time, you’ll be more likely to be triggered. Do yourself a favour and either BLOCK these forums, or avoid looking at their posts. You know what is best for yourself. Surround yourself with the correct energy if you are REALLY serious about recovery. &lt;I engaged in BJJ where weight training is really important. If you are pathetically light and weak you will get DEMOLISHED.&gt;
11. Bloating. An anorexic’s worst nightmare. You’ll be bloated for 1-2 months then the weight will redistribute to other areas. Personally, I was bloated for about 2-3 months before the blob mysteriously settled in other places. This will be the hardest time that you will have. 
Lastly, always push your boundaries. If you think that you are satiated enough, try taking 1,2, mouthfuls of food after that. You can do it. if you think that you cannot intuitive increase your amounts, you will need to create a REASONABLY MEALPLAN. No cheating with Super Low calorie days

Recovery is an uphill battle and it’s never a final destination. For most, it is journey and a set of choices you have to make Everyday. Stop comparing yourself to others who skip meals here and there, they do make up for it somehow with late night snacks/other snacks/heavier meals. 
You are responsible for your own health. Persevere! It’s worth it.

3093,dzeqfu,I want to scream-but I am too exhausted,"I was diagnosed with AN when I was around 12 and was then diagnosed with bulimia when I was 13. Before the initial diagnosis I lost 20 pounds in 3 weeks. The medical professionals viewed this as extreme. 
I have suffered from disordered eating habits for the past decade. It is a constant struggle. I always go a few weeks heavily restricting calories then binging for an extended period of time. Although the bulimia actively persisted until I was 15, (I was hospitalized to treat it when I was 14) the AN has not gotten to the point it was when I was first diagnosed-
Until now. 
I have lost 32 pounds in the past 5 weeks, total of 40 in the past 3 months. On a GOOD day I will eat 200 calories. I ate 160 calories today after my therapy appointment in attempts to make progress, and it destroyed me. I spent the rest of the day terrified that I am going to gain weight now. I now feel the need to punish myself in some way. The other night I ate about 40 calories worth of raw spinach and I did 100 sit-ups because I was so terrified that I would gain weight. I withdrew from classes for the semester and am currently unemployed, which is a recipe for disaster. This means that my days consist of weighing myself 30 times a day, compulsively trying on my clothes at least 20 times, and doing copious amounts of sit-ups. I am at the point that I barely drink water because I cannot fathom the thought of the extra .4 pounds showing up on the scale. 
I feel sick. All the time. I feel sick whenever I try to eat, but sick when I don’t. It is affecting every single area of my life. I don’t want to get a job right now because I am afraid I will pass out on the clock. I can’t do the schoolwork I owe from last semester because I can’t concentrate. I can’t go out to eat with my boyfriend (or anyone) because of the awkward social dynamic between myself and the waiter/waitress. Going out to eat is something my boyfriend enjoys-not to mention, who is still incredibly thin-and this is an enjoyable experience I can no longer share with him. I can’t go out to eat with his family. I got mad at him the other day for correcting my driving, when I knew that his concerns with my driving were valid being I am so disoriented all the time I can barely drive. Yes, I realized that I mentioned all the issues with my boyfriend after saying it is affecting every area of my life. This is because I have isolated myself to the point that I have pushed away most of the other people that are close to me. 
My boyfriend is very supportive, and I feel as if I don’t deserve it. His sister wanted us to go out to dinner with her yesterday, the second time she has asked in the past two weeks. I declined the first time, and after an emotional breakdown, I declined again yesterday. Yet he still sat there and held my hand, listened, gave me advice, and told me he is willing to do absolutely anything to help me. He even told me to make sure my therapist knows this. And I know he means it-words are not cheap for him. If he doesn’t want to do something, he will tell you with no shame. 
So why do I feel like this when I have not only him, but a few other supportive people in my life? 
Because this illness feasts on every negative thought I have and devours it. Because this illness takes up every essence of my being. 
I spoke to my closest friend to it the other day, and she tried to offer advice but failed miserably. She tried to relate to me which was nothing less than a failed attempt. It really annoyed me. (Sorry just had to add that in there since this is a rant) 
And then my mom called me to yell at me about not having a job. I confronted her and was transparent about what I am experiencing-she was STILL angry with me and made me feel ten times worse. And she is literally part of the reason my disordered relationship with food manifested the way it did over the course of my life. 
Anyway. The thing is, I WANT to get better. I want to stop ruining everything in my life. But I can’t. Every time I try, I fail. When I write “binge” in my food log, that means I ate 300 calories. 
And I do have cravings. I think about making the salmon with jasmine rice that I cooked for my boyfriend that looked delicious. I think about eating that single McDonald’s cheeseburger. But I can’t. I just can’t. In fact, I even think about just eating hummus. I can’t because it has 60 calories in only two tablespoons. I know I can have fresh salsa that is only 5 calories for the same serving. 
Every time I eat, I feel disgusting. I feel like I failed. I don’t want to feel this way. When I feel okay, I tell myself I can do this on my own. But whenever I eat, or when I’m suffering from insomnia and I’m cold and shaking, I realize maybe I can’t. 
The thing is, I’m overweight. That’s what makes this all ten times worse. I know it’s not just me. I know I’m overweight and that I NEED to lose weight. But I can’t fathom the thought of doing it in a healthy manner. I know if I attempt to eat “normally” again, I’ll binge. And I can’t. I just can’t. As you all know, it’s an addiction. And I am deep in it at this point. And I only relapsed about 3 months ago. I didn’t even realize up until a week ago that this started back then when I was eating a can of peas and two slices of whole wheat bread. Because I deemed that as normal compared to the severity of the issue now. 
I keep telling myself that I’m not sick enough because I’m overweight and I have only been severely restricting (0-200 calories) for 5 weeks. That’s when I tell myself it’s not even an issue. But there are always those moments that I experience severe physical discomfort (in many ways) that remind me that maybe this is an issue. I don’t even know. If you read this far, does it sound like an issue? 
The people around me seem to be very alarmed, and this causes a disconnect between those people and myself as (most of the time) I am not nearly as alarmed. My stepmother keeps telling me I should go to the hospital. Yesterday, after I told my boyfriend that I have lost 32 pounds in the past five weeks he paused-
And said, “I am terrified of losing you” 
I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I can stop. Perhaps if I do go longer barely drinking water and eating 0-200 calories a day (usually 50-100 when I’m not fasting) I could die eventually. Sometimes it feels like my body is giving out already. I am severely dehydrated, I have aches and pains, cramps, insomnia, chills, nausea, dizziness, impaired vision, severely impaired concentration, constant faintness, etc...
I’m just so tired of living this way. I literally thought about making an excuse to not go visit my mom for thanksgiving (who I barely see-maybe 4 times a year) because I am absolutely terrified that I will gain weight when I’m there. Actually, I know I will since my metabolism is so wrecked and I will have to at least eat dinner with them at the table. The other night I stayed up an additional 2 hours to try and develop a detailed plan on how to avoid eating and burn calories when I am there. 
I couldn’t even stand to speak to my roommates for more than 2 minutes today because they had brought home a speedway pizza (yes, the gas station. It’s really good xD) and I couldn’t bear to look at it or smell it. It used to be my favorite. It made me sick. 
I feel like screaming. I feel like crying. But I’m too exhausted. I am not religious therefor I do not believe we go to a physical place when we decease, but fuck, if hell did exist this would be fucking it. And that’s saying a lot for me, being that I suffer from an array of other mental illnesses and have been in psychiatric inpatient treatment 11 times and in a residential treatment center for two years. 
This is hell. I want to leave. But I just. Fucking. Can’t. 
Does this sound as urgent as everyone is saying it is? I am not asking anyone to diagnose me (per the community rules) as I already know I have a diagnosis. I am just asking if this relapse sounds as severe as everyone is making it out to be. I don’t know whether or not I should treat this with the same urgency that everyone else is. Maybe if I do my best to adapt the same mindset I can force myself into treatment. But I don’t know if I can because then I will HAVE to eat :’(

3127,dytx34,I haven’t purged in four days!,"I’ve noticed a lot of unhappy posts in this sub, so I decided to cheer some of y’all up by letting you know that recovery is possible! 

Long story short- I have been dealing with an ED since the age of twelve, and I am now 18. My original diagnosis was Anorexia Nervosa and my symptoms morphed into Anorexia Binge-Purge, which, needless to say, caused a FuCkToN of weight gain.

ANYHOW I began my freshman year of college this past fall and my way with coping with the stress and the transition was to be face to face the contents of my stomach every evening. It got bad enough that I called my parents crying and we formulated a plan on attack. So, for the past month and a half, my binge/purge tendencies have been gradually decreasing and with it I am finally beginning to lose the weight I gained from my abusive eating habits.  I am proud to say that today marks the fourth consecutive day that I have not thrown up, and thus is the longest I have gone in about a year and a half. 

Much love for everyone who is struggling, please hang in there. I foresee myself possibly beginning to restrict heavily especially once the purging is eradicated. 

Pro tip: don’t throw up. It’s awful. Having gone through both at different stages of my ED (and currently), Ana is bad but throwing up is 37382992 times worse- repeated abrasions to your esophagus can cause tearing and eventually your stomach acid will degenerate your teeth. It’s actually one of the worst things you could possibly do yourself.

I don't want to waste food but I don't want to gain weight if that makes since. I feel like even if I purge all the food I will still end up gaining. It's already bad because it's been a while since I have purged which mean I don't even know if I still can. I was in recovery for a while but then someone called me fat becuse i weighted lwss then them😐 so now i have to hope thst my family does not force me to eat to much. I feel like I am only going to eat mac and cheese and some turkey because that's what I normally eat anyways.

3148,dyik8v,Weight Loss/Drug Abuse and ED Comorbidity,"About two years ago I was at my smallest. I was 117, and that was from restricting. I did do acid, but nothing serious. I’ve been pretty good since then across the board.  But I’ve been spiraling down since Spring, and now I’ve lost weight again. This time it’s purely from drug abuse. And I like it. Not that long ago I purged because even after all this time doing so helps my anxiety. I hate how drug abuse and ED marry. They go together extremely well. But now I’ve noticed the way my body is losing weight is different. I used to look softer than now. Now I look angular and harsh. When I started my ED I was 12. Now I’m 19. I guess it’s just part of growing up with all this. It affects your body differently as you age. Does anyone else have experience with this? With comorbidity of this kind? Or like having done it all for so long being able to see the progression of your body? And to go even further, did aging affect your ED? Once I noticed the roundness and fullness of my body in adulthood, it made me uncomfortable. I know my body is more mature, but that maturity is not so easy to look at when I’ve had and ED for over 7 years.",1574158357,11/19/2019 4:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dyik8v/weight_lossdrug_abuse_and_ed_comorbidity/,3

I’m determined to go back to my old ways to lose all the weight I gained and more..  Less than a year ago I was around 55kg (121 lbs) though I wasn’t happy at that weight, I’d kill to be there now.

At one point in my life I was at 48kg (106 lbs) and I really really wanna see those numbers again! I can’t even look in the mirror anymore, it makes me so upset and frustrated just KNOWING what I currently weigh.

3198,dxi4tl,tw A story: Having an ED in Bootcamp,"So I just came back from Basic training... prior to I was very bulimic and previously anorexic ( before finding bulimia). I had to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Literally the Petty Officers would be upset if you missed a meal. At first I just went along and ate normal portions because I knew we were gonna be doing a lot of pt (+ some beatings bc the female house couldn’t get their act together) so I didn’t want to pass out bc of starvation and all that. But later on in training (wk 4-5) I started falling back into eating as little as I can without being questioned, but two recruits would make commentary on my meal size. I struggled the entire 8 weeks to not purge out anything I regretted eating. And the showers gave me mad body dysmorphia. There were so many skinnier girls, I envied them.

I don’t want to destroy the last 2 months of progress of bettering my body to just start purging again. Idk but I just wanted to post this.

3236,dwhw79,DAE find that people treat you differently when you're underweight?,"&amp;#x200B;

**TW for BMI talk (No #s), general symptom/treatment discussion**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hi friends,

So I've been relapsing pretty fucking hard since the end of the summer, and I'm now at my lowest weight in a long time, and worse symptomatically than I was before I did Tx in the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

I've found something super weird about how people interact with me in recent weeks. I've been told by a lot of people that I look pretty sick (but I have body dysmorphia, so honestly, I can't see it, I just body check and find things I hate).

&amp;#x200B;

Now I live in a large urban centre, and it's always busy in the downtown core. When I'm out and about nowadays, people offer me seats, even at a coffee shop I ordered a...well.... it was a ""safe"" drink and the barista was kind of weird to me (not in a bad way necessarily). She was super gentle and giving me the ""oh honey"" kind of look, and made sure I could see her putting everything together for my drink. I really appreciated this though, it makes me less anxious when I can see how things are prepared if I can't do it myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it was raining a couple weeks ago, and I was standing at a busy intersection, without an umbrella, and a man was standing beside me with a big umbrella. He held the umbrella over me (he was still under it, it was massive). Honestly, I was kind of taken aback, because even though there are kind people everywhere, most of the time, people in my city can be either indifferent (just keep to themselves and aren't kind but aren't rude), or they're fucking asshats lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Also people stare at me all the time!! I catch people looking all the time, and they look away awkwardly. So weird. I've stopped looking around when on transit because I hate catching people staring.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anybody else have similar experiences? I don't know if I'm just hyper aware, or what, but I don't think this happened when I was closer to a normal BMI/normal BMI.

&amp;#x200B;

That is all. Have a lovely day, night, whatever! :)",1573774193,11/14/2019 17:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dwhw79/dae_find_that_people_treat_you_differently_when/,7

3265,e23ldz,Scale &amp; other obsessions vent rant,"So here I go again.

Couldn’t keep the scale away. I know I should get rid of it but knowing myself I’d probably just buy a new one. Have loved weighing myself ever since I was young.

Wanting to see my ribs again properly, check my hands n stuff that the bones still there. My body image is so fucked, why am I so obsessed with looking like a literal skeleton? Jeez

Exercise is coming back to the picture too. It’s nice cause it makes me feel good but it’s also bad cause I’m always thinking need to lose some weight &amp;amp; do too long sesh with little but mostly no food at all especially after some cardio cause u know them calories be burning then.

And controlling hunger n food fantasies by smoking, less caffeine nowadays tho, makes my anxiety so much worse ugh, decaf has been a life safer. Decreasing it has helped me sleep too.

Like I often fantasise about gettin into hospital. Never felt real love &amp;amp; barely care about my health so ana doesn’t even scare me that much. Mainly just annoying but pain pills help n blanket for the cold. So what if my body starts to eating itself? U get the endorphins which also feels good so who gives s fuck. Bite some gum, smoke another cig right?

I wish I could really start the recovery process but it seems so impossible. Life is just gonna hit my face if I do. And when the coldness n pain goes away I’m scared my body changing &amp; suddenly gettin fat, like what?

Been outpatient for awhile now but it ain’t really working..

3275,e1shwe,"One step forward, Two steps back","I have never posted on this sub before because I very rarely talk about this issue to anyone, but I need to vent about something that happened this evening. I’m a man in my early 20s, fwiw. I apologize if the formatting sucks, I’m on mobile. 

So I was reviewing my Renpho app, which is the app connected to my smart scale that tracks my weight and all my info like BMI, body fat %, body muscle %, etc and I noticed that I had lost 35 pounds total since I started tracking. 

I was thrilled about this milestone so I sent a screenshot to my mom who sees me 2+ times a week, along with a picture of myself with my cousin (we’ll call her Sara) from summer ‘18, when I was at my highest weight. I wrote all this out in the message. 

Then my mom, obviously having read nothing and only looking at the chart, responds: “good weight loss. Nice pic of you and Sara, where are you guys? Is she still with [her boyfriend]?”

So basically my mom who sees my multiple times a week thought that a picture, from 18 months and 35 pounds ago at my heaviest weight, was taken tonight. Naturally, I was really upset and tried to explain to my mom why, but she got super defensive and started screaming/playing the victim so I just dropped it. 

Later I showed my dad just to see his opinion and he said I looked “skinny” in the before picture which was obviously just him trying to diffuse the situation because I may look like a lot of things in that before picture, but “skinny” is not one of them. 

I asked my mom about it later and she said she was not interested in talking about it anymore and that I need to just get over it and stop being so sensitive. This bothered me even more because she’s constantly begging me to open up and talk to her about these things, but I often don’t want to because she acts this way. 

Honestly this is the shit that makes me anorexic and gives me body dysmorphia. When I look at the before pic I am disgusted. And she basically confirmed to me that that’s still what I look like to people even though I went from 205lbs to 170lbs at 5’9”. The only time I felt like I wasn’t fat was when I was under 140 in high school after an extreme months long caffeine pill-fueled fast. 

I know it’s probably not healthy to go back down to that weight but I can’t stand this feeling of having all the extra weight on my body and knowing that the first thing people think when they see me is “fat guy.” :(

What do you all think? Am I overreacting by being upset? I know not everyone is going to see me the same way I see myself but my own mother not noticing a 35lb weight loss is really disheartening.",1574741317,11/25/2019 22:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e1shwe/one_step_forward_two_steps_back/,2

Originally, and the majority of the time, I would deny myself stuff because it's a form of self harm that I can have more control over get away with--bdcause people can check your body, but not know it's from denying sustenance rather than scars or cuts, which are very apparent and obvious.

3305,e11rc4,"Losing my ""best friend""","Hey there, on the more positive side of recovery here. Not sure if anyone will read this, because I doubt I would have when I was sick. But here goes nothing.

When I left recovery I felt like I lost a friend. And I never had many friends growing up so it felt even harder to lose this disease that had been with me for so long. I wondered if it would ever go away or if I was doomed to be in and out of treatment for years.
But I slowly found that the ED was not my friend, much less my best friend. If anything it was an abusive relationship. I stopped thinking of my eating disorder as something that could help me and replaced that with more recovery-oriented ideas and practices. After a hard day I wouldn't make myself exercise, I would make myself watch a TV show or talk to my family. You have to tell that ED it isn't your friend, it isn't your best friend. Recovery is your friend and will take you so much farther.",1574617714,11/24/2019 11:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e11rc4/losing_my_best_friend/,1

I nodded along because I was still in denial; in my own little world everyone around me was crazy and I was the only one who really knew what was going on. Everything they said I agreed with so I could get out of recovery and family therapy as fast as possible. But I never saw my anorexia as a monster. It was always just me. I had always had intrusive paranoid thoughts, the eating disorder just gave them a direction. I am still so ashamed i’ve never admitted it to anyone. They tried to separate me and my illness but no one ever understood me and my illness aren’t two entities. We are one and the same. It’s been with me so long i can’t think of me being me without it.

3336,e039lh,Girlfriend losing attraction to me after a year (our anniversary is tomorrow) because of my constant negative comments about my body. She said she’s getting tired of me always tearing myself down,"tldr; Your partner of a year tells you they are losing attraction to you because of how much you hate yourself  and make negative comments about yourself only makes you hate yourself more.

--My 1-year anniversary with my gf is tomorrow the 23. Just tonight from like 10-12pm we had a ""discussion"" 

My gf told me she has lost attraction to me because of how negative my body image is. She said that it hurts to see/hear me tear myself down all the time and I guess just shit on myself constantly ( we also live together) She says I probably don't notice how pervasive it is.

She said that she even wished she could have even been with me when I was thinner because maybe then I wouldn't have hated myself as much back then.

I have had an ED for 13 years and I have BDD. I gained over 100 pounds due to psychological meds years ago and havent been able to lose the weight.

I go to therapy 2 times a week (have been with my current therpaist for the past 3 years) and been in therpay working on my ED and body image for 13 years.

When I asked for a way to quanitfy how much attraction she has lost, 10 being the highest (as in where her attraction was when we first met) that now shes fallen to an 8.

I'm disgusted with myself. I see no way of fixing this. I've been in therapy for most of my life and truly hate my body. I AM dusgusting, I hate myself and I don't see that changing. She also said me not doing anything about it- like working out or something is what's unattractive too and I have felt so much PERSONAL guilt about that in the past and now knowing that is another reason she's attracted to me...

I recently just started a prescribed pill to help manage my weight but who knows what that will do.

I don't see how our relationship can continue. The way I see it: My body image is not going to change- yes I will continue to work my ass off in therapy but this has been my reality my whole life.I don't see how her now 8 can turn back to a 10. I challenged her and said whats the solution? Do I go to the park tomorrow and start running? Then will I be at a 9?

I just feel like I am going to be paranoid now that she will continue to lose attraction to me and she wont tell me (the only reason we had this talk tonight is because she talked about this with her therapist yesterday and I pulled it out of her--she wanted to tell me on monday after our annivesary tomorrow) and I will contantly be questioning whether shes lying to me.

And now I just feel gross. Like I don't deserve to eat, I feel sick to my stomach hours later.

She still loves me and doesnt view this as a ""relationship ruiner"" and thinks maybe she will just stay at an 8, or go back to a 10. For her its just frustrating and shes ""getting"" (as in not DONE and checked out) sick of the negative self talk.

So I want to clarify she isn’t making comments ABOUT my body ie: calling me fat or anything it’s the fact that I put myself down so much that it’s becoming too much

I want to break up now before this gets worse and she loses more attracion to me.

I'm so hurt.",1574439919,11/22/2019 10:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e039lh/girlfriend_losing_attraction_to_me_after_a_year/,11

3365,dzfgxx,Im scared,"I have always been a big girl. Not really ‘fat’ but thick. I have a square body. I will never be ‘curvy’ anyway, in High school I was at my lowest point in life. I was suicidal and I hated myself. I hated how I looked. This is silly, but I thought boys didn’t like me because I was ‘fat’ I wanted to lose weight, I would exercise and still nothing. I finally got a job in a kitchen at the salad line. For the whole summer I would work 8 hours a day 5 days a week. During this time I was truly ‘alone’ as in nobody would be watching me. I stopped eating. When I would get hungry I would munch on the veggies to make my stomach stop growling. That summer I lost 30 pounds. When I came back everyone complimented me saying I looked amazing. I of course loved this! This was the first time people told me that! So this kept up. I would only eat at school lunchtime because that was when people would watch me. I skipped breakfast and dinner. The reason I stopped is because I started losing so much hair. I loved my hair. My hair was my pride and joy. One day in the shower I was conditioning and as my ran my fingers through my hair, I literally pulled out a clump. My heart sank.  I stopped washing my hair because I was so afraid of how much I lost. This was 7 years ago. The hair loss is honestly what made me stop. If I didn’t lose my hair; I would probably still be at it.
Now here we are. I’m starting to slowly slip into that mindset again. I hate what I see in the mirror. I started counting my calories and running again. But the results have been slow. Today and yesterday I only ate one meal. My stomach is growling. My roommate and I got in a fight the other day. Honestly she is the one that feeds me. She knows about my ED In the past. But her being upset with me honestly got me really anxious and I skipped out on dinner. It’s not her fault, it’s mine. Since I skipped out on dinner for 2 nights I have been going to bed with an empty stomach. This is the scary part. Hearing my stomach growl and feeling hungry makes me feel good? Like I accomplished something. I used to get this feeling in the past when I had an ED but I don’t want to go back to that. I don’t want to lose my hair. It has never been the same. 
Anyway, this is just me venting. I don’t expect anything from this.",1574319351,11/21/2019 0:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dzfgxx/im_scared/,0

(Summery : my boyfriend cheated on me bc of my labido being so low but we started to work on our relationship but my labido hasn’t gotten any better it’s to a point where when we do things I don’t really enjoy it and I dint know what to do because I love my boyfriend so much I don’t want him to cheat agin but I haven’t even started treatment yet and my ED is bigger than me right now and I’m not sure when it’ll come back) 

(For background info on me and my bf relationship)
So me and my boyfriend have been together for 3yr and some months and we have a long history of breaking up and getting back together and we don’t have a very good history of when we are together.
We’ve had a lot of downs and very little ups. We’ve worked though all the times he’s cheated and all the times I’ve talked to / where friends with people he wasn’t ok with and all that but we’ve worked though it all. 
This past year we actually started to better we didn’t do the whole break up and get back together thing we tried to work everything out. I gave up everyone in my life he didn’t want me around or to talk to I do everything I can to make him happy he doesn’t work bc if his anxiety and ive paid everything for him for the past year I love him so much I’d do anything and everything for him he makes me happier than I could have ever imagined 
(End of back ground info on the relationship)
I went though a phase in my early eating disorder where it kicked in really bad when we would break up and start to get better when we would get back together. But about 6 or 7 months ago my eating disorder kicked in really bad and because it kicked in really bad it caused problems in our relationship since I wasn’t eating as much I was more tiered and I wouldn’t go out to eat much and he didn’t know I had an eating disorder when it had kicked in so I got distant and that’s where all the problems started so he freaked out and we had to have a big sit down discussion about it and everything and I had to explain that’s why my libido was so low and things just went down from there. Since my labido was so low he wasn’t the happiest since I didn’t wanna do much and he talked me into getting help and going to inpatient treatment but I didn’t stay very long due to my anxiety and when I had got out I found out that he had cheated on me but I said to myself people make mistakes and we said we’d work on it and id get help but i had to wait a while to get into a treatment and we’ve been working on a lot where yes my labido is still very low but we talk more and figure out better solutions but my labido hasn’t gotten any better and I can tell my boyfriends getting annoied and it’s getting to a point where when the very and I mean VERY occasional time that we do have sex or something I don’t even really enjoy it like my body just doesn’t respond in a good way and I’m worried my bf will cheat agin or that I’ll be holding him back from someone who can give him something I can’t and I don’t know what to do do I be selfish or do I set him free I love him with everything in my body I love him so much I’ve givin up everything he’s asked me to and givin this relationship every single thing in me but I don’t know what to do if anyone’s ever gone though something like this and wants to spread some wisdom and advice it would be very very very much appreciated",1575514684,12/4/2019 20:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e6asmz/so_im_not_sure_if_this_is_my_ed_causing_these/,4

but recently its been way more intense. usually when i get into a starving fad, its a mostly conscience decision, but i didnt even notice that i just wasnt eating my lunch for abt a week. all of a sudden im only eating dinner, and nothing else throughout the day (so essentially a little over 20-21 hr fasts all the time).

3388,e5qhh1,A Recovery update,"Hello everyone. 

I wanted to take a few moments to talk about my progress in Recovery. I want to do this because I wanted to show others who are contemplating, stressing, obsessing about Recovery some of the perspective being in the middle of it. 

 For background: I have had an Eating Disorder for most of my life. I had small episodes growing up, but when I was in my late 20's, I began a cycle of severe restriction and exercise followed by months of binging and eating, and it cycled like that until this year when I sought therapy and recovery. It has been 10 months since I started the Recovery journey. I see a therapist once a week, and I am also taking anti-anxiety medication. 

 It is not easy. Recovery is the process of un-fucking your head, and that takes time, and it takes perseverance, it takes grit, and it is messy. It is one of the hardest things I have embarked on... but it is absolutely worth it. 

The past two weeks have been the longest stretch of time since starting recovery where I haven't had a meltdown, a freakout, a setback, or examples of falling back on the ED behaviours. I have named my ED (Phi Phi), and I have gained insight on some of the why of my actions. I have also been learning the tactics and strategies to work through the ED thoughts as I get them. 

One of the biggest things for me in my recovery is that after I was out of the severe danger moment of malnutrition, is the focus on my self-esteem, my self-worth, and why I use eating as a way to punish myself for the things I feel I need punishing (mostly failure to be perfect). Also, we are starting to look into why my anxiety is presenting itself by restriction, mental self-harm, and worse. 

I have had tearful breakdowns, angry meltdowns, and I almost ""fired"" my therapist and quit ""recovery.""

Thats when I found out that you can't ""quit"" recovery. Failure is a part of progress, and there is no such thing as perfection in recovery. My therapist is an amazing woman who has the right levels of support, and ""kick me up the ass"" to cut through the ED bullshit that I sometimes spout. She has been instrumental in giving me the grace and space to tell me ""it is ok if you had a bad week."" and not to beat myself so much for it. 

The last two weeks have been really good. I am not obsessing about food, and I am being nourished, and I am comfortable with where I am. Further, while I am still a ways off on things like self-esteem, self-worth, and that negative voice in my head, I feel that I have a bigger emotional and mental cushion to address those larger issues because... well frankly... because I am not starving myself. 

Yes, I have gained weight. But I am now losing weight and doing it in a much healthier way. I went from famine... where I ate nothing. To feasting... where I ate all the decadent things I wanted to eat, followed by pure anger that I did that. Now, I am moderating my food intake in a healthy way, and my weight is slowly coming down. it is still too slow for my liking, but that is what I am working on with the therapist. I eat ""normal foods"" and I am maintaining a steady caloric intake while still exercising. 

So, does that mean I am done? Hell no. Recovery is a life long journey, and it is important to remind ourselves that it is the Journey, not the destination, that is important. I will have setbacks, but I will have many more victories, and I know that my mental outlook is part of why I will be a success. 

I know that for many here, the journey seems daunting and impossible, but I am here to tell you that each of us have the ability to beat this. When I thought of Recovery at the beginning, I could only see an impossible destination that I could never hope to achieve  - happiness. That is what the ED told me. But now, I see recovery as the process of addressing my insecurities, my anxieties, and my disordered eating in a way that makes me a better person to myself and the people around me. Happiness is not the destination, it is found during the journey. 

My husband and I have a cute shorthand on my ED thoughts. I will tell him if ""I am having an overcast day"" which means that the ED thoughts are loud, and they are covering the person I am underneath. On an overcast day, all I think about is the ED, the food, the weight, the numbers, the anxiety. Partly Cloudly is where I am managing the thoughts, but they are persistent. 

The last few days have been clear blue skies, (and the accompanying song also helps heaps). 

Thanks for reading, and feel free to respond if you have questions or anything like that. 

You all are amazing, and I hope you have a great day.",1575418451,12/3/2019 18:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e5qhh1/a_recovery_update/,1

Any kind words or advice are appreciated.,"I recently got off of antidepressants and I have had an issue with my weight since they greatly affected my metabolism. I went from 5'6"" and 130 pounds (underweight) to 200 pounds (very overweight) within a year or two. 

I'm currently trying to go back to how I was before everything went to shit by doing Keto and working out. However, my dad keeps making snide comments about my weight and it keeps pushing me into old habits that I thought I got over. I didn't eat for two days straight because I felt so ashamed. I ate today and I feel horrible for it, I easily had over my allowed amount of net carbs. I also exercise 3 days a week at the gym, and I've been exercising myself into calorie deficiency. It's like a tug of war between systems right now. Giving into the temptation of eating and the temptations of starving at the same time. 

So I've been considering purging. I hate puking but I'm getting deeper and deeper into this pit of despair. My stepmom just made cookies, I know in going to eat them, I won't be able to control myself. But I'm scared about what I will do after. My dad's voice keeps ringing in my head on repeat.

3418,e4vgj9,I don’t want to die,"I’ve lived with this for 8 years. My therapist and dietitian both remind me weekly that I could die. I would reluctantly nod my head and just brush it off. My best friend has reminded me over and over that I only have one kidney and I need to be careful. I kept saying that I don’t care and I’d rather let anorexia kill me. I hate living. I hate my body. I hate that no matter how good my life appears to be, I can’t be happy. I don’t know how. I hate feeling this way. Being alive is exhausting and seems pointless. I’m 23 and I’ve been suicidal since I was 12 and had an eating disorder since I was 15. Recently diagnosed with anorexia. My mind tells me I even fail at that. In my twisted perception, I should only be eating xxx calories and exercising at least an hour daily and if I’m not meeting those impossible standards, I’m a failure. Even if I do, I could always do more. I can always eat less, exercise more, weigh less, etc. I work full time and do school full time so I run out of time and tell myself daily that I’m a failure, I eat too much, I have no self control. There’s been times in the last 8 years where I wasn’t actively restricting and I thought I had it under control. But I was only eating like twice a day and still thinking constantly food. I was still telling myself I was a failure for eating. Still hating my body and wishing I could rip my skin off. I hate living with this and feeling this way. I feel worthless and that I’ll never achieve anything. It’s so much easier to just give in to my disorder. I know I’ll die, but for the longest time, I didn’t care. I had a sort of wake up call. I was coloring with some of my kinder students. I realized from talking about skin color with crayons how discolored my hand is. My nails are blue, my knuckles are blue, and the rest of my hands are dry and red. They aren’t the peachy white that they should be. They’re cold. I get told all the time how cold my skin feels. I say I’ve always been that way but I haven’t. I always thought my nails looked blue but I’d tell myself it wasn’t as bad as I thought. But I took me seeing my hand next to a 5 year old to realize how sick I am. I went home and had a panic attack, terrified that I’m going to die. Because it’s true. None of this “oh I might die” bs. It’s either I get over this or I die in my 20s and never get to experience life beyond hating myself and thinking everyday that I should give up and I’m going to reach my breaking point. I have had bladder issues for the past 4ish years. I have always dismissed it but now I’m terrified. I hate thinking about all the damage I’ve done to my body by hating myself so much. I don’t want to die. I thought I did but I don’t. I don’t want to feel the way I feel and the only means I saw for that was death. They tell me that eating and fighting this will bring happiness and maybe they are right. Maybe I won’t be so miserable all of the time. I’m trying to fight this but I don’t know how. It’s hard to convince myself that eating will not destroy me or make me any less valuable. It’s hard to eat. I hate the anxiety. I want to live. I don’t know why it’s so hard. I don’t know why I can’t just listen to my therapist and my dietitian. But I’m trying. And I really hope I can come out on the other side. I’m sick of this. I’m sick of simply existing not believing anything positive people say about me. I’m sick of hating myself and getting anxiety anytime someone mentions any function that could possibly involve food. I hope I can look back in a few years and not recognize the girl who is writing this. I hope that I can learn to love myself.",1575270864,12/2/2019 1:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e4vgj9/i_dont_want_to_die/,4

Hi. My name is AnorexicFigureSkater and I’m 15 years old. I’ve been struggling with an Ed since eighth grade changing from anorexia to BED. After a month of practically binge eating, I have gone back to hating my body after all of the damage I have done to it. I’m 5ft and weighed 95lbs last month only to found out I gained 10 last week. I am now exactly 100lbs after now restricting my calories and have more body dysmorphia than I ever have had before. I am now trying to loose weight until I become underweight again (my lowest weight was 82lbs).

This may be for many reasons but one of them is because I just got a new boyfriend, hell my first real one. He said that when we see each other on Monday, after not seeing each other for a week, he’d pick me up. He also asked how much I weighed so he’d “be prepared.” I don’t want him to not be able to pick me up or judge me by my weight (after thanksgiving and the excessive binge eating lol).

Why can’t I just be a normal person and eat normal without caring about what I look like?

3453,e3ipwx,The pleasures of relapse,"Okay, I have a few questions if anyone else has experienced this or just some advice. 
First of all I was at my lowest this past summer. And I noticed my skin was horribly dry, my brain couldn’t think, I was always going off on customers at work (thank god im a bartender &amp; no one really cares too much) 
My whole personality changed &amp; I would cry all the time. Food was disgusting to me &amp; my jaws hurt to even chew anything. Somehow I managed to start eating a whole meal a day. 

Personally, I feel recovered. But I have not gained any weight. I feel a lot better &amp; eat when I’m super hungry. But I’m mostly just eating to call myself “recovered” 

Well lately relapse has looked so beautiful. Does anyone else get a high when they relapse? It’s like suddenly I’m beautiful again, my life is in control again, I’m more outgoing &amp; more confident. Of course until my starving side effects start ruining all of that. 

Does anyone else experience this? Like the first few months of starving are just fucking wonderful? Or am I just fucked forever?",1575052576,11/29/2019 12:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e3ipwx/the_pleasures_of_relapse/,8

I guess I had alcohol and some more carbs. However that doesn’t usually cause this much of a change. The scale went up.

Then I drank more alcohol the night before Thanksgiving and today I got a fattening white chocolate mocha at the airport and ate a huge plate of fattening thanksgiving food.

I already was sad about my body change that seemingly came out of nowhere which could be water weight but in honestly not sure. I didn’t eat THAT MUCH a week before it happened. Just saltier things and alcohol ajd a bit more carbs.

Tomorrow I’m gonna despise my body. How do I get through the anxiety of this? I haven’t eaten this bad in months.......

This year has been especially difficult and over the last 2-3 months I’ve started eating less and less. I started writing down when I would skip meals and the feelings associated with it (mostly that I felt fat, felt gross etc). I weigh myself every day and gauge how much I’ll eat based on that number on the scale. I hardly ever exercise anymore due to long demanding hours at work but I am starting to drop weight. I’ve read a little about anorexia but it seems that most older adults aren’t generally in the demographic. I guess I’m starting to get worried but I’m also confused because of my age. I did bring this up to my doctor and she chalked it up to stress but the super stressful period of this year has passed. I’m also wondering if it’s possible to just toe the line of the diagnosis because it feels like that’s what I’m doing currently; being absolutely aware of how I feel and look, not eating as much based on my weight that day etc. Thank you for any advice m/insight everyone.",1576092369,12/11/2019 13:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e9bqua/can_this_develop_in_your_later_years/,5

3506,e8hegn,Extreme guilt after eating anything,"So Basically all my life I've been fat and I hated it. It got to the point where i got severely depressed because I hated how I looked in the mirror. Fast forward to two years ago I said fuck it and started exercising regularly. I felt good. Even though I wasn't losing weight I wasn't gaining any which was a first for me at 16 years. I only stopped exercising after I got really sick. Fast forward a few more months I was in the ICU as it turned out I had type 1 diabetes. I had had a complication which meant that i just instantly shed a ton of weight. I used to be about 90 kilograms (for reference I'm 5'11, 6ish) after the matter I maxed the scale at 68. For a few months after I was just getting back into the flow of things. I still wasn't mentally happy maybe even worse off. My sister goes to UPenn and I had been aiming for Harvard. In the span of 6 months I went from being the best to knowing dog shit in my classes because due to my illness I had to skip so many

The only thing that made me happy was when people commented on how I had lost weight and I looked good. The Doctors said that for the first year they would suggest against exercise as I frequently experience hypoglycemia. The thing is injectable insulin also causes a bit of weight gain. So as time went on I started to gain weight again. It wasn't anything dramatic just a kilogram. But I felt that it was I integral that I remain thin.

That was 6 months ago. Since then everyday I have been eating &lt;1200 calories a day. Even when I do eat I feel extremely guilty. To the point I start having suicidal thoughts

My grades arent up since last year and I feel like i dont deserve anything.

Mentally I'm in a pretty bad place rn so I really just needed somewhere to vent. I'm sorry. I hope you guys dont mind.",1575931529,12/9/2019 16:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e8hegn/extreme_guilt_after_eating_anything/,1

3510,e8euls,Eating disorder &amp; issues with social life,"Hi guys.

 I've been feeling bad, so, this is just a venting post.

Recently, I found myself (yet again) avoiding social interactions at all costs. I told most of the people that wanted to spend time with me that I was very busy, studying for finals, but that's just a lie. 

I'm scared to hang out with people because I don't want to wear anything else besides the gigantic old gray cotton shirt that I wear every day. I don't wanna wear clothes that display my body, and I don't want to caught my reflection looking disgusting on any surface. 

I don't wanna go to dates in fancy coffee places and just ask for a small espresso while my date eats just whatever they want without the gut wrenching guilt that I feel every time I eat something that has ""too many calories"" 

People is starting to grow tired of me avoiding them, and I can't gather the courage to say that I'm succumbing a big ED relapse 'cause I gained a bit of weight in the last mont, that feels like such a bullshit excuse to cut out of my life so many people.

you caught my stolen glances
in windows of coffee shops,
the sunlight of the downtown burning a gaping hole through the middle of my thighs.

You put your hand on my shoulder,
and in the quick caress of my bones,
I felt all your questions.

how did this happen?
where did I go?

how didn’t you notice?

it started small, the cold hands,
the sleepless nights.

you wrapped your fingers around the bowl
of my hips in the light of dusk before bed,

and I held my breath, waiting for the anger,
the despair,

I wanted to beg you to notice,
I wanted so badly to be validated for my crimes,
somehow both the prisoner and jailor.

your hands brushed away, 
across the bite marks on my hand,
over the mountain range
that has become my chest,

and you turned away and slept.

It started small, 
and somehow the empty 
spaces grew around me,

hollow in places where life should be,

It started small and now 
I’ve been caught red handed,
with this so very private lover,
this silent undoing of a girl,

and I know you can see it,

3522,e86r5y,Worried about little sister’s friend,"Hey there, I’ve never been on here but I’m hoping to get some advice. I recently visited my family from college and was talking to my little sister (11). She was asking if she should get her friends Christmas gifts and I suggested she make something like cookies for her friends that weren’t her “besties”. She said something like “Ana* doesn’t like sweets” and I said she doesn’t like sweets? And she said “well she doesn’t eat them she’s always dieting” so I asked her what she meant and she said her friend (also 11) was constantly telling her she was “dieting” and wouldn’t eat anything during lunch. I asked her if she ever offered her something and she said she purposefully only packed a banana for lunch and that her mom thinks she packs more. This made me really worried, I’ve never met this girl and this was just one convo with my sister but it sounded like bad news. I told her to encourage her to eat and told my sister a little about how some girls her age will sometimes try to not eat and it can seriously hurt their health (she’s a little naive and immature so I tried to simplify it and kind of give her some extreme examples so she knew the severity). And that that doesn’t sound good for her, and she was saying that in health class they were learning that so that’s at least good. First, is it appropriate to suggest to my little sister to take some sort of action like speak to her about it or get more info, and second what can I even do? Also
My sister isn’t the most confident and she’s emerging into puberty with a little more weight than the average girl her age. Can seeing another close peer start down this path “inspire” young girls? Should I talk to her more to ensure she doesn’t think *she* should start “dieting”?",1575876399,12/9/2019 1:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e86r5y/worried_about_little_sisters_friend/,1
3523,e85aqz,My Brother makes anorexia jokes,"I had a very rough patch with my eating disorder last year and dropped underweight. My brother has never been underweight or acted in eating disorder behaviour from what anybody has seen, but he constantly makes jokes about him being on diets or being bulimic etc. For example, mom will ask him if he wants any leftover dinner after he's eaten, and he'll say: ""no thank you, I'm an anorexic now mom"" as if it's funny, and everybody laughs. He does it all the time, and he's aware of my past situation (although not to the extent, he's not aware of me taking pills for weight loss etc. Just that I was underweight and happy about it). My whole family made comments about my weight at the time, and some family members were aware it was anorexia, and it's also most likely that he was told. He continues to make these jokes and comments about his weight and calories in food etc. He's a joker, and it's become part of his 'routine' that everybody knows him for. Tonight he put on the story of karen carpenter who died of anorexia for us to watch, and against my better judgement, I decided to watch it. I'm now in the headspace again, and I decided to try and fight it and got a pizza out the freezer to eat. I offered my brother some, and he sang ""why do birds suddenly appear"", a Karen Carpenter song, and said he wasnt going to have any because he's ""going to lose half a stone"". My disordered thoughts took over and I put the pizza back in the freezer even though I was hungry. This is not a subject I can address to family, but I cannot take his 'jokes' anymore. He is not anorexic. He is feeding into my eating disorder and did all through my bad period, I'm having an especially difficult time atm and it's been triggering my unhealthy thoughts anyway. I have said things in the past about skipping meals and stuff to him, something he does not do, and he has replied ""yeah girl, get them collar bones"" and stuff like that. At the time, I didnt realise how bad that was and it would encourage me. I cannot take this anymore, and hes been making these jokes for years, it's his 'thing', he's not going to stop. I don't know what to do. I know this is a strange situation, any advice would be appreciated. EDIT: My brother is on the bigger side. I know weight doesn't actually correlate with disordered thoughts, I know you can be bigger and anorexic at the same time, but he makes these comments for comedy/attention and nothing else. He doesn't display any other symptoms of an eating disorder, and I've watched him and know a lot of what to look out for because I did/do them myself. It's also worth mentioning that ive been a vegetarian for 5 years. My sole motivation for this was to lose lose weight, as my brother boasted to me he that lost loads of weight when he was vegetarian, and mom had told him he looked anorexic. She's since told me this never happened.

In all seriousness, that has truly been my experience with inpatient. It feels like a f’d up competition.

3543,e7qtuv,can’t stop weighing my food,"hi all

just a quick background story for context

i had anorexia when i was 14 and was in recovery when i was 15-16. relapsed again when i was 17. now i’m 19 andddd here we are again.

i feel so ashamed. my brother in law and mother in law saw me weighing food in the kitchen...i said “oh it’s just for portion control”. they suspected nothing. or maybe they were just trying to stay out of my business. 

i mean.. I don’t want to be an attention seeker or appear to be a snowflake, but i know my brain’s just changed since this disorder took control of it. i WANT people to tell me i am skinny or losing weight — those words sound like accomplishment to me. deep down i know i am sick and i need treatment...but i really can’t afford it. im living by myself. husband is away for bootcamp and hasn’t been returning my letters. it doesn’t really matter anyway...i can’t bring myself to tell him that i’ve relapsed again. i want him to not worry.

i’ve been losing weight rapidly and i don’t want to say this...but i am not happy until those numbers i see on the scale turn into double digits. 

i thought i’d let this out to see if anyone is going through the same/similar thing. have a good night :)",1575789449,12/8/2019 1:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e7qtuv/cant_stop_weighing_my_food/,0

but the thing is, i just feel so much more comfortable here because my anorexia (and my depression) is all i’ve really known. so i’m not sure if i should wait it out until he’s gone or what. i just don’t know what to do.",1575780929,12/7/2019 22:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e7pix7/i_can_feel_myself_relapsing_and_im_not_sure_if_or/,0

It felt perfectly under my “control” for so long and I thought nothing could bring me down... but we all know control is a big illusion... While I’ve struggled with eating disorders for many years, I’ve been subconsciously eating too little these past 6 months... BUT there IS hope! This past week i’ve been eating more in a day than i have in a LONG time!   and let me tell you! It is so much fun to eat without doing mental calculations. I didn’t even realize that I was doing them because it became a habit to look at calories and food labels for every food i ate. I honestly didn’t even realize I had “relapsed” back into old habits ... but this past week has been so much fun! just eating whatever/ whenever I can. Trying to eat healthy but letting myself eat foods I haven’t touched in so long! Big advice: don’t look at food labels! This has made all the difference for me... Trust yourself. Treat yourself. You deserve it! 

Sometimes it helps to view yourself as a friend would view you. What negative and degrading thoughts have you been repeating to yourself lately? 
If you’re like me, you are probably a lot nicer to your friends than the voice in your head is towards your self. But shouldn’t we treat ourselves with the same compassion that we would a friend?

3550,e7jlog,Anyone else???? LONG,"Recently I’ve been looking at my past eating habits and trying to understand them a bit more. When I was younger I was a chubby kid who ended up losing a lot of weight in a short period of time. Soon after I was diagnosed by my doctor with anorexia. Three years after the diagnosis I gradually gained about 15-20lbs. I hit a rough patch and started binging pretty badly. I was spending hours just mindlessly eating and eating. I gained 100lbs from on and off binging over 2/3 years. Now I’m sitting here, typing this at a very healthy weight, almost a year free of binging! Unfortunately losing weight is a big trigger to my anorexia and I slowly feel her creeping up. I actually had to stop dieting because I knew exactly where I was headed. I let myself get to the point where I was physically nauseous just looking and thinking about the food in front of me. I’m just nervous guys, I seem to have a pattern of starving, binging &amp; now starving again. I’m scared to gain weight, I’ll do anything not to gain it’s become a true fear. I don’t want to start binging again and hating myself but I really don’t want to end up starving myself from fear of gaining. Please, does anyone else go through this??

i know for a FACT it was 92.8 because i DEFINITELY would've remembered if it had increased by five lbs....

i didn't know what to say and by the time the big doctor came in she mentioned me being 98 as well and was obviously expressing her concerns and we talked about how I've been struggling. i didn't say anything but i feel really guilty now because im going back next week for bloodwork and im sure they'll be looking closely this time...

and by then ill likely be the same weight or even a little less. they're gonna think i dropped almost 10 lbs in less than a week...whaT DO I DO? it's really stressing me out all because the stupid nurse didn't do her job right. what would you do in this situation?",1575726433,12/7/2019 7:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e7eh35/so_the_doctors_office_got_my_weight_wrong/,7

3562,e77h8i,I may have anorexia. Looking for some advice to prevent this from getting worse,I think I may have anorexia. Years ago I was very worried about becoming obese even tho I was very thin. I was also ocd I think constantly washing my hands and only eating “clean” foods I was only like 11 years old. I would look in the mirror and think I was huge and I had an irrational fear of becoming huge. I mean this sickening horrified feeling that I had no control. I also must have been delusional but this snowballed into extremely restrictive eating for a few years. Anyway somehow I recovered from this and haven’t had any issues with it or ocd since until this past year and I’m 28 now. I accidentally lost a lot of weight and am underweight. At first I was worried about my health but after seeing family and everyone’s comments on my weight loss I’m feeling very triggered. And I can feel the obsessive thoughts creeping back in that I haven’t had in so long. Also I’m feeling a bit delusional because I feel in my body that I am thick and have gained weight and then I got on a scale and I had actually lost weight.  I’m feeling ungrounded and I don’t want to pay for therapy but I’m dying to talk to someone. I’d really appreciate any recommendations I don’t want to have a sick mentality and I can feel I’m sort of there,1575680230,12/6/2019 18:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e77h8i/i_may_have_anorexia_looking_for_some_advice_to/,1

Two days ago, in the same day:
-My therapist told me she wants me to go into residential and that I’m going to die. 
-my boyfriend told me he that he can’t do this anymore. He can’t watch me kill myself. That he is not even worried anymore, he’s scared every single time he sees me. 
Unfortunately, my family doesn’t see this to be as serious as an issue as they do, so they haven’t been a factor in my decision to attempt recover. 
But-my boyfriend-he has loved me like no one else ever has. He has tried to help in every way. We have already worked through so many difficult things together. But this has been the breaking point for him. To see the fear in his eyes-welling up with tears-
It killed me. I couldn’t do it. 
I have never thought it was possible for someone to love me as much as he loves me. 
I tried to sabotage this relationship by telling myself he would love me more if I was skinny, because it’s difficult for me to believe that anyone truly loves and cares about me. 
I asked him what he liked about me when we first met, and the list was long, one that included traits like intelligence, radiance, self-reliance, diligence, compassion...
I have lost all of these traits that everyone loved about me because of this damn eating disorder. I am a shell of myself. Hearing him vocalize all of that really helped put things into perspective-it helped me realize how much of myself I have truly lost. 
He held me for a very long time, and I started crying-
And he said, “I just want my (my name) back”
It was in that moment that I decided I can’t do this anymore. As much as I want to-but I’m combating the thoughts one by one.
I ate yesterday, and I was SO proud of myself. Then I woke up this morning and I said that I was going to fast for 7 days. 
I really, really, want to. Because a huge part of me is in love with this horrid eating disorder too. But one day at a time. I’m going to try and eat something small and not go and exercise at the gym for 3 hours. I picked up some yarn and needles at the craft store and I started knitting again. I’m going to try, because I can’t lose everyone that loves me before I end up dying. I’m going to end up dying alone if this continues. And I am lucky enough to actually have people who care. 
I think I’m even going to make a super impulsive decision and get an eating disorder recovery symbol tattoo. Perhaps if it’s inked on my body I will feel more of an obligation to get better. 
I’m going to try, at the very least. I’ve recovered before. I can do it again somehow. 
You can all do it too. 
We are all so much more than this. We deserve more than dying. I know that is very difficult to believe-
But we ARE all capable. 
We ALL deserve to be loved. The people that truly love is will NOT care about our appearance. That’s a pretty shallow way to judge people-so why should we continue to judge ourselves like that? 
If others don’t deserve that, we don’t either. 
If you guys would like, and are willing, maybe you can all list some traits about yourselves in the comments that you valued about yourself before your eating disorder. Or even things that you still like about yourself now (excluding anything to do with weight)

A part of my disorder has always been the attention that weight loss garners- the recognition. 

No one is concerned. I call myself fat, and lazy. I misread comments about meals and misconstrue them in the most narcissistic ways.

3607,ecj2nn,I’m scared that it’s back to haunt me,"To start this off- I want to give you all my story, as I am new here. When I was in fourth grade, I witnessed my dad kill himself. That resulted in me being diagnosed with PTSD, severe anxiety and severe depression. I was out of school for a few months and when I went back to school my teachers found me on the playground cutting myself with a piece of glass that I had found on the ground and screaming about wanting to kill myself. They called my mom and that same day I was put into inpatient care at the nearest psych ward. While I was in there I had also gotten diagnosed with autism. I met many people and it confused fourth grade me. I met this girl who clearly had severe anorexia- and I was convinced that I had to be skinny like that too. So, since fourth grade I have been struggling with anorexia nervosa. I am 18 years old and graduated high school last year. It would normally get worse around the summertime because my mom would never be home to watch me. I thought I had fully recovered since last summer but for some reason I have been subconsciously not eating. I eat less than one meal a day and I have convinced myself that I am obese. I am 5’4 and 120 pounds. I wanted to stay at 90 forever but after I moved out of my moms house and into my older sisters house- I have gained so much that I didn’t want to gain. I am desperate to get back down and for some reason I don’t even have to think about it anymore. I simply just don’t eat. My boyfriend has noticed and also pointed out that I have stopped taking care of myself. I don’t shower, brush my teeth or hair, i don’t do my makeup anymore, i don’t go to school, i don’t have a job and i don’t have a license. I feel like a fucking failure and I want to end my life.

(5’4 108lbs) 
So over the last two weeks my ED behaviors have escalated. I went from eating once a day, to once every two days (not every other day- every TWO days) 
In the past I’d be happy after eating a single meal because I could finally justify eating! Now I want to vomit (and often do if I’m at home). 

I feel so awful. I hadn’t eaten since Sunday (currently Wednesday), and just broke my fast with about 500-700 calories of rice, curry, and bread. 

I was wondering if anyone had any resources that could help me deconstruct this mindset and behavior on my own? Any google search I do just gives me the same 10 lines about what anorexia is. 
So any paper or blog that mentions the levels of anorexic behavior, starvation, etc would be really helpful.

""thats almost 200 lbs"" i was going through a manic phase where i lived in my car for a week and a half and accidentally developed a tolerance for hunger pains. it became a slippery slope. i was finally able to say no to the food i love the most. i was never consistently obsessing over the actual measurements of my body. the only measurement i had was my weight. i never did research on starvation or eating disorders at all so the only thing i knew how to do was starve myself. not eat. anything. in the first three months i lost 20 lbs and was down to 170. after moving out of my moms house i did have a scale anymore because my dad is anti-weigh-yourself but i visited a friend a few days ago which is the same friend who filled my head with tips and tricks on how to starve myself better that offered for me to weigh myself on her scale... so i did. 165 now thats not too much weight lost but im 5'9. i am supposed to weigh a lot more than that especially since my body type is pure muscle. im stopped trying to starve myself because i just do not have to anymore. hunger pains feel like a tattoo. theyre just there now and thats how it is. i dont eat any food. i eat a bite of a snack here or there but ii havnt eaten a meal in two months. My body is also very curvy. i had a big butt. (i pretty much had the ideal body) and now i just look sick. i feel hollow. i take pride in my physical strength yet im shaving it away. i see no difference in my body besides my butt and boobs getting smaller. im still huge everywhere else. i plan on getting help but not until my mom is out of my life completely but thats a different story. i have no idea what im doing. all i know is that im not eating.",1576603962,12/17/2019 11:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ebyvyi/im_bad_at_being_anorexic/,0

3637,ebx2u5,Jealous of my sister's weight loss.,"I'm conflicted. 21, FtM. When I was younger I used to be the skinny sibling and my eldest sister, L, was always the largest. My gran and other sister, and my dad would always chastise L and call her fat and things. I always had this threat hanging over my head that I'd be 'as big as L' if I ate a lot of food.

When I was in highschool I never ate much for dinner because I came from a poor background and received free school meals. All this has led me to think that being thin is amazing and gaining weight is bad. Which obviously isn't true. 

I've been out of high school awhile and I've started gaining weight which wouldn't be an issue except L has lost loads of weight recently. She looks great, she's unrecognizable. I hate it. I hate being the largest sibling and feel like I have to lose loads so that L is the largest again. 

I feel glad for her because she looks so much happier and healthier, but I can't stand the comments I get about my weight and eating habits now. I've got a reputation in my family for eating loads, when the topic of food comes up I get: 'you eat like a horse' or 'You're a greedy git'. 

For the last two days I've gone cold turkey. I ate one meal yesterday and I'll do it today. It hurts, but I like the feelings of hunger. I just don't want to do too much, and have everyone get suspicious. I don't want to develop an ED, but I want so bad to be the smallest sibling again.",1576595911,12/17/2019 9:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ebx2u5/jealous_of_my_sisters_weight_loss/,1

3642,ebpmxo,"I feel so pleased with myself, it is borderline disturbing, and I can't share why with anyone else in my life","The first reason is: the battery in my scales died a few weeks ago and I didn't have a screwdriver to open the compartment to replace it, so for weeks I've been sneaking to use other scales. Today I finally bought a pack of screwdrivers (I didn't know what size or type I needed ugh) and a new battery. Finally. I am so happy. No one else would understand except here. 

The second reason is: I thought my GP didn't care about my ED and so I thought that meant I definitely was too fat for my BMI, because she's a doctor, so if I was actually sick, she should care right? Today she told me ""look at you! You're looking increasingly cachectic"" but that she knows she can't make me do anything, so ""when"" I'm ready for treatment we'll do something. I feel so validated.

3652,ebhm4o,My mom gave me appetite increasing medication when I was younger.,"According to my mom I was apparently extremely skinny when I was younger ( 5 or 6 yrs old ) and would be a very picky eater. My whole family is kinda chubby and my mom is a foodie along with my brother and my dad loves sweets. But I was very skinny so she got worried and brought to doctors. Multiple ones. 

All of them said the same thing; ‘she’s in a healthy range of weight’ but she didn’t want to believe that so they booked a appointment with this doctor who was really hard to meet and asked them if there was something wrong with me. My mom said that like others he also said I was healthy weight but apparently I was given some medication that made my appetite increase. 
Looking at the photos I looked like a inflated balloon when I entered primary school ( 7 years old ) and was almost always overweight and chubby looking. 

I know my mom was worried but if she had no reason since the doctors reassured her but instead she gave  me that medication and I can’t help but wonder if I wouldn’t even have to struggle with my weight and could just be skinny like when I was younger.",1576514968,12/16/2019 10:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ebhm4o/my_mom_gave_me_appetite_increasing_medication/,6

3658,ebb85b,Irrational ed panic,"Posting in here once again to talk about how pathetic I am. I lost my tape measure. I’m broke and don’t have a scale so this is the only way I can tell if I’m making “progress” besides sneaking weighing myself at other people’s houses. I looked everywhere in my room and still can’t find it. I found two other tape measures. One I accidentally cut while knitting which is why I have the one I lost. It had tape over the slit but still had a centimeter gap. This can be important in knitting so I don’t really use that one. I have another one I bought on impulse for knitting because it had my initial and is retractable. I fished that one out of my knitting bag so I could measure myself. But when I realized I lost the one, I went into full fledged panic mode. I still can’t find it and still feel panicky even though I have two others because I feel like I just need to know where it is. It makes me so anxious that I can’t find it. It’s been sitting on my nightstand and suddenly it’s gone. I look behind the night stand and my dresser, behind my bed and in my blankets, inside my desk and nightstand, nothing. My best friend was over today and I feel like they saw it and took it but I know that’s irrational. But is it really? They could have took it so I won’t measure myself. They know I have an eating disorder. I want to text them and ask if they saw it and say I need it for knitting but they’ll see right through my bullshit. They struggled with anorexia.

Fear that I’ve made him anxious or that he wasn’t able to trust me with what he was going through but mostly fear that whenever he comes home that something I think as being helpful will cause him to relapse.  

My husband and I are going into therapy and asking our other adult children to join us.  But if you could give me some advice, what can I do or avoid doing that will make my son feel supported.

3675,eaz6rz,My(24f) ex girlfriend’s (24f) ex (26f) suffered from Anorexia and died this summer. I’m still very upset,"My ex girlfriend’s ex— M, passed away this summer after a routine tonsillectomy, and was severely underweight after struggling with anorexia for many years.

We were extremely similar in many ways, as we both struggled with eating disorders— except she did not have health insurance that would pay for treatment. We had an amicable relationship, and she reached out to talk to me quite a bit given the fact I was dating her ex. 

Now my ex and I are broken up, and I’m still very upset by M’s passing. She was so beautiful and sweet, and suffered with anorexia so badly. She even reached out to talk about her boy problems with me and I stupidly waved her off. I regret it so badly now, who the fuck cares I was dating her ex?? I should’ve responded.

The current guy I’m casually dating doesn’t understand why I’m so heartbroken over her passing even though we didn’t talk much. It just hurts so badly to understand the specific place she was in with anorexia, even down to how her body would have felt at that weight (she passed away at around my lowest weight). 

She received a routine tonsillectomy, and her body was so weak that she hemorrhaged twice, the second time going into anaphylactic shock after losing too much blood. I’m not sure quite why I posted this here, but I guess I hoped someone would understand why I’m so sad that someone so much like me died. I can’t help but wonder if she would still be alive if she had access to treatment like me. And hell, I’ve honestly been starving myself too. 

I love you so much M, you and I were so so alike in so many ways, down to our father issues, love of Japan, even our specific mix of racial ethnicities— but I wish Anorexia is something we didn’t share. You basically had a harder version of my life. I wish I could have given you my nice health insurance that pays for 100% of the premium at the stupid fucking fancy treatment center I went to by the beach that has catered restaurant night, art therapy, and a whole bunch of other things.",1576418084,12/15/2019 7:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/eaz6rz/my24f_ex_girlfriends_24f_ex_26f_suffered_from/,6

3684,eaozxh,I ruin everything I do because I can’t do anything right.,"Seriously... recovery wise and ed wise. I “ruin” fasts by eating the tiniest amount of junk food. I “ruin” “good” days by not counting how many calories I’m consuming. I “ruin” my goals by not having the energy to exercise. I “ruin” starving myself by accidentally putting too much creamer in my coffee. I “ruin” ed plans by not being able to drink my coffee black. I ruin everything according to ed. Everything I do that’s not consuming literally nothing but coffee, breath mints, water, and zero calorie drinks and exercising to the point of exhaustion is ruining everything and going to make me blow up like a balloon. Ed doesn’t want me to be happy. But then I ruin recovery when I do consume food (what a fucking concept, doing something you need to live, how terrible of me). I ruin it by doing stupid shit like refusing to sit while I’m working for hours because I “don’t deserve it” and “need” to work off the little amount of calories I ate the night before. I ruin it by starving to create a “deficit” so I can deserve to eat dinner with my parents and can still successfully hide my ed from them. I ruin it by flossing, not for dental hygiene, but to get rid of any “extra” calories that may linger in my teeth and make me fat. Then I ruin it by worrying about calories I might accidentally consume through mouth wash. I literally can’t do anything right. No matter what I’m doing, I’m losing.

We didn't compete nearly enough, we just lived the same things, but now I know I've gained weight and probably she didn't. She might find me unattractive, which sucks. So, I've decided I'm gonna restrict for a couple days to see if helps. And triple exercises. Though I know it won't be enough. Kinda scared here.

3711,ea3kdp,What's It Mean to Be Anorexic?,"I wasn't diagnosed because I was told I wasn't bad enough to have anorexia or an eating disorder in general (plus for not losing weight). So it's gotten me to wonder: what's it mean to be anorexic? I've starved myself, restricted food, counted calories, checked the scale, think I'm fat, have thoughts like an anorexic, and so forth. How bad do you have to be until you are considered anorexic or even for starters, having an eating disorder?   


I was also wondering if eating happens when you're anorexic. I've seen ED memes where people say they're planning on restricting food but then end up eating (how they hate themselves for eating). It's never binging, but like you eat something (small, perhaps, but still ate). Can you eat snacks or even a meal and still be anorexic? Is it the thought process, behaviors, or both that make you anorexic? Can they be separated (ex: thought process but not committing the behaviors)?   


Thank you in advance for your replies. I've been questioning this for a long time ever since people say I must have an eating disorder with the way I am functioning (whether it be the thought process or behaviors) but then my therapist said I wasn't bad enough and due to not losing weight, I can't have an eating disorder. I relate to many anorexics and have made edits about it to vent or express how I feel. I know that you are not professionals, I just feel like the professionals I see may not be best to go to (mostly because I hear you can have anorexia without losing weight).

3713,e9zwzs,Read my horror story caused from anorexia. Stay safe&lt;3,"I thought I'd share the experience I had the other day bc it scared the shit out of me and I want people to be aware. My baby was in the hospital bc of the stomach bug (he was born with his intestines outside and had multiple tummy surgeries after birth. He was admitted to make sure it wasn't anything more than the stomach bug with some tests). When I'm stressed my anorexia kicks in 100% and I can't eat anything. So of course this situation has me worried and I stop eating. After 2 days of no food, with weeks of eating &lt;500 calories beforehand, I woke up for my childs blood draw at 7am. After they were done and he stopped crying a nurse told me she would change his outfit bc there was some blood on it. At this point I started to feel dizzy. I sat on the bed with my head between my legs and suddenly felt like I was going to throw up. I grabbed my water cup and walked to the bathroom where I'm not sure if I collapsed or laid myself down. I was on the floor and couldn't see, hear, or feel anything except my shoulder. I could still think and was wondering why my shoulder was shaking and slamming into the ground. After some time (I'm still not sure how long) I sat up and told the nurse that was with my son that I blacked out. She sent an attending on the floor to our room and some ER nurses came with a stretcher. After doing vitals and explaining what happened, the attending told me it sounded like my blood pressure dropped so low, my body made me have a seizure to save me. They wanted to do a CT scan and an ekg but I denied medical treatment. I know they would've hospitalized me after seeing my weight/bmi and after testing my blood. I've never had seizures before and didn't know this could even happen. It really scared me, especially since juice wrld died the morning before, after he had a seizure. 
TLDR; after eating very little for a few weeks and then not at all for 2 days, my blood pressure dropped so low causing my body to have a seizure to save me.

3721,e9ugqm,Am I being ab**ed?,"So, during more recent years, my mental health has plummeted... I don't want to bore you, but the only way to explain it is by a little backstory:

So I'm a middle child of 5, and I always had low self esteem, with high expectations, which I always tried to surpass, never looking at what I have achieved, but rather, what I could've done better.. granted, this was manipulated by people but that's not the point.

My eldest sister, since a young age, has always hit or threatened us to do as she pleased. My parents don't know about this because we are too scared to tell them.

As we grew older, I became closer to one of my sisters, because she helped me whenever I felt scared. But my eldest sister always tried to turn us against each other, lying about what the other one has said and making up BS, in the end, I would ask my sister if she actually said that, and she would tell me that she didn't, and we would make up .

Now, most recently, she always invalidates whatever I am doing, telling me that ""some people have it worse"" ""if you have an eating disorder, then what do I have?"" ""You know about calories, why don't you help me lose weight?"" ""I used to self harm, but I cut much deeper than you""(which is a lie) 

Today, she pressured me into tutoring a student, and my perfectionist self told me that I can't do it because it wouldn't be my best, as it was crammed in the middle of others, she swore at me and told me that I'm embarrassing her and that I'm unprofessional and a failure, and that I'm not good enough.

I'm too scared to see her now.

Am I being abused? Or is this a common thing?",1576188436,12/12/2019 16:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e9ugqm/am_i_being_abed/,4

Or maybe it’s because they want to give me a better internship  based on my extremely high test scores? I’m hoping it’s that. 

Aggggh. Lol. I think I’ll be fine, but the fact that I’m already over analyzing the reason they chose me… Not the best sign? 

 Everyone else from my school has to work at a nursing home, so I consider myself extremely lucky because they do phlebotomy and EKG at the clinic I was assigned to...and I won’t be cleaning poop everyday (so that’s a plus)

3724,e9q5hl,"My bf might have an ED, because of my habits? LONG","Personally I wouldn’t say I have an eating disorder, however I do fast for most of the day and watch myself weight wise constantly. However when I’d bring this up with my boyfriend he’d just make a little joke like ‘anorexia tings’ which never bothered me until we both started to count our calories. At first he did it out of curiosity I believe but now he does it to lose weight and keep track and not too long ago he jokingly said ‘Might become and anorexic and obsess over how many calories I eat’ and I know it was a joke ( maybe ) but I’m worried for two reasons. One reason is selfish because I don’t want him to be smaller than I am and the other reason is because I want him to be healthy and eat enough. He won’t go over the calorie limit the app gives him and he’ll do exercises if he does but not a lot. Part of me thinks he’s going to end up with an ED and the other part of me feels he wants to be healthy. He’s 5’9 and 180 or 170lbs so he’s pretty okay (I think) where he is but I also think I influenced him in a small way and enable this because we share how many calories we’ve had, I don’t know what to do really and I feel bad about this,,, help ):",1576169675,12/12/2019 10:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e9q5hl/my_bf_might_have_an_ed_because_of_my_habits_long/,0

3743,ef8djy,Had a difficult day? You're not alone.,"I'm just writing to connect with anyone who has just had a difficult Christmas Eve.

I really struggled with Rex, the ED voice in my head, today. He kept me in check constantly, telling me I wasn't allowed to enjoy Christmas. He also told me that stepping an inch outside of my routine was going to mean I would lose a mile (and all control). At one point his bully tactics completely overwhelmed me so much that I lost it, breaking down emotionally in front of my family. Thankfully they were supportive. But the shame and guilt this has left me with tonight is nauseous.

This (what I know is) irrational thinking completely conflicts with the inner child in me that really wants me to have a Christmas like he remembers, where nothing was off-limits or second guessed, and where any childlike behaviours were ok. Where he could be himself.

So if you had a rough day today, just know you weren't alone. Your experiences and thoughts were unique to you, but you had brothers and sisters around the world who know how you felt. They felt it too. And they are thinking about you now. I'm one of the them.

I've re-written my letter to Santa tonight, and hopefully he'll be able to deliver the last minute change. I honestly couldn't care for a material thing in the world right now. All I want for Christmas is... a box full of self-kindness. Let's hope I find that under the tree in the morning.",1577227955,12/24/2019 16:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ef8djy/had_a_difficult_day_youre_not_alone/,3

3768,eep9vn,A Message for the holidays," Over the next couple of days, many of us will be faced with one of the toughest holidays of the year: Christmas. For a lot of people, even the word brings anxiety and thoughts and promises of restriction. Family will be seeing us and for some, the effects of restricting over the year may come out. There are a lot of stresses with the holidays and over the last week, we have seen some posts reflecting that high anxiety. 

What I want to say is something simple: Be kind to yourself. 

I know that seems weird to say, but a common theme I have seen on the sub (and within myself) is the constant self-blame, self-loathing, self-hatred tied to feelings of being unable to eat, unable to lose weight… being unable to eat… for whatever reason. Many posts start or end with “I hate myself.” I know I have said that many times to myself. 

It is ok to be kind to yourself. 

RuPaul famously says “If you can’t love yourself, how in the hell can you love somebody else?” I have always found that quote hard to stomach because my feelings of empathy and love extend outward, not inward… but there is truth in the statement. While I am not asking for the Christmas Miracle of everyone on the board suddenly gaining love for themselves… I simply ask that you are kind to yourself. 

What does that mean? 

It will be different for everyone. For me, it means that I don’t punish myself if something is not perfect. It means allowing yourself to have something and have that moment with your family. It is to not allow the ED to dictate your happiness. 

And if those are too big, just a step. A moment where you let yourself be loved by someone. To allow someone to wish you a Merry Christmas, and you accept it, because… you know they mean it. It means allowing yourself to know that someone is thinking of them. Even if it is from here.

If I don’t, I risk the continuation of being triggered. 
My roommate who is incredibly thin (naturally) (almost positive she is underweight) keeps asking to eat my foods. I have been attempting recovery for the past two weeks and have allowed myself a few more foods than previously. Broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, bell peppers and sugar-free 10 cal jello. That’s it. Yeah, really not crushing this recovery thing...
It just makes me SO angry that she can literally eat whatever she wants, whenever she wants and she wants to have my FIVE foods that I can eat? It creates a me vs. them mentality, and makes me feel even more isolated from this illness than I already do. 
Although I’ve lost 60 pounds in less than 3 months, I’m still not even close to thin or underweight. She is MUCH thinner than I am which is such a daily trigger for me...I was doing better for about a week, but after she asked for one of my tomatoesI didn’t eat for 5 days (100 and something hours). I JUST forced myself to eat some carrots and very conveniently, she asked me to eat some of my jello about 20 minutes ago and now I feel even worse about eating.

3793,ee1m5v,Giving up,"I can’t do this anymore. I can’t. I’m not looking for sympathy or someone to give me the cliche “don’t give up” “it gets better” “you are enough”, etc. I’ve heard it all before and it doesn’t work. I could read those 10 million times and it wouldn’t make me feel any different. Life is shit. I actually don’t have that bad of a life. But I am incapable of being happy. No matter what I do, I’m depressed. I’ve lived with depression and anxiety for 11 years. Nothing works and I’ll never be happy. I’ve lived with this fucking monster in my head for 8 years. It’s never going to stop. I eat and I feel anxiety. I can’t just have good days. I eat and then I freak out and purge and then restrict the next day. It’s basically a cycle of restrict, eat (not binging) because I can’t take the hunger, panic and purge, restrict, try to eat normal because I’m sick of feeling this way, panic and purge, repeat. When I don’t eat I feel terrible, when I eat I feel worse. At least when I restrict and follow the rules I made for myself, the voice is a little quieter. When I eat I can’t focus on anything. All I can think about is the fact that I ate and the guilt. All I can’t think is I wish I were dead. At least when I don’t eat I can think about other things because I don’t worry about what I ate. Maybe I’ll die. I don’t care. I can’t live with this monster in my head forever. I can’t just eat like a normal person and live with this anxiety forever. They say I’ll eventually be happy but I won’t. They say eating will get easier but it won’t. I’ve tried and it just doesn’t happen for me. I’m destined to live with anorexia for the rest of my life. I’ll die from it. Because I can’t fucking fight this anymore. I went to a new doctor this week. I don’t own a scale because I’m broke but I measure myself often. I weighed myself at the kids I babysit house the day before my appointment. I was 95 pounds. On the verge of underweight. Then at my appointment, I was 101 pounds. A healthy weight supposedly. I was wearing my shoes and my coat but there’s no way that’s going to add 6 fucking pounds. I gained weight. Even though the day before I ate so much food and te day of my appointment I had eaten nothing. I gained weight because I’m a lazy fucking moron with no self control. I can’t handle it. I hate gaining weight. I don’t care if I’m underweight. I can’t do this. I’d rather be underweight. I’d rather be thin enough so I can feel my bones. And even see them. Every pound I gain makes me hate myself even more. I don’t hate fat people. I’m actually quite jealous of some of them. The one thing I do want is a nice ass. I have the flattest ass on earth and I hate it. But I still can’t eat because when I do, I gain weight in all the places I don’t want. I don’t hate fat people and I don’t think they are lazy, ugly, stupid, etc. But it’s different for me. I don’t know why but it is and there’s no use fighting it anymore. We had bloodwork done at my appointment and the only concern she had was my potassium and it was still normal. In my fucked up brain, that means I’m not trying hard enough. I don’t know why I want to be sick and I wish I didn’t. But I’m never going to get to a place where I want to be healthy. I don’t even think it’s possible for me to be healthy anyway. At my next therapy appointment, I’m just going to say I can’t do this anymore and I’m giving up so I’m not going to come anymore and waste her time. My therapist is wonderful and she’s helped a lot of people overcome eating disorders. But I never listen to her anyway. I’m not going to continue going and waste her time. She needs to focus on people who aren’t fucking failures and actual listen to her advice and have an actual chance of making progress. I’ve made myself a list of rules and strategies to avoid eating. I’m actually going to do it this time.  I’m going to follow the rules my ed has given me. I’m going to lose weight and maybe I’ll eventually like myself for once. This recovery thing doesn’t work so I give up. I can’t wait until I die so I don’t have to feel this anymore. I’d kill myself but I don’t have the nerve. Plus if I fail, my life will be even worse. So I’m just waiting until this monster kills me. Then I’ll finally be free.",1576995879,12/22/2019 0:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ee1m5v/giving_up/,1

I went through an extremely traumatic even a little over a year ago, was diagnosed with PTSD and Bipolar disorder, and have been dealing with the repercussions of the event. A few months after I was really low and started eating and intentionally ruining my body because it made me feel safer being unattractive. I really let myself go, gaining 45 lbs. Since then, I’ve been working hard on my mental health and finally finished therapy about a month ago. When my husband made a comment to me about my body (it was harmless and not ill intended at all, but I took it the wrong way), I freaked out and started focusing on weight loss. I started out eating 1200 calories a day, but every day I find myself struggling more and more to even eat. I’m getting about 400 calories a day most days, but am finding it increasingly hard to get even that many. It’s been two weeks and a day, and I’ve lost 12 pounds. My sister got mad at me and told me I was acting anorexic, but seeing as I’m still overweight, still look disgusting, and there is no visible change in my appearance, I didn’t believe her. My husband felt the same way as she did when he found my calorie count. I guess I’m just confused on what makes a person anorexic, and what is just weight loss.

3798,edyq38,How Bad Is It?,"TW: Vomiting, Numbers, General. 

Alright so I’m not sure what I’m looking for here-validation? Outside thoughts? Maybe I just need to vent?

Basically I eat every two days or so (drinking coffee and water to sustain myself otherwise). And when I do eat, it’s one meal. Usually less than 700 calories if I can help it. But I’ve gotten to a point where try to vomit up basically every meal I manage? Today I ate 5 small crackers and instantly ran to the bathroom to purge. And then it was the same for dinner (half a chicken wrap) only a few hours later.  

I don’t exercise much, but I’ve gotten into the habit of walking to further bus stops after work, and getting off the bus early to walk home even though it’s freezing out. Some of my coworkers have noticed I don’t eat, so I actually started putting out snacks on my desk to give the illusion I am. In reality they just sit there. 

I’m just now reaching underweight territory, with my BMI at 18.5. I don’t have time to talk to doctors or therapists because I have a really invasive full-time job. And the people in my family would only yell at me if I brought up the struggle. 

How bad does this sound? Do you think I can get better without a Doctor intervening? I’ve lost about 55lbs in the last year, most of it through restricting. But it’s never been like this.

3800,edw81u,[Trigger warning] Time for some pure ED bait from my father,"Trigger warning: fatphobia, mention of amounts of calories and sugar but no specific numbers, suggestion of skipping meals to “make up” for doughnuts.


My father has a problem with desserts. Like he compulsively eats them in large quantities... one time he ate 3/4 of a 16” cookie cake, and today I guess he ate somewhere between 8 and 10 doughnuts. But he will never admit he ate them, we all get yelled at for it. When I woke up (slept in because night shift) and saw there were only bits of 2 left I decided it was time to shower. I’m now naked in my bathroom listening through the door because I just *can’t* go be part of it. It’s always the same. He’s yelling at my brothers for eating so many doughnuts... he has literally never once admitted that he was the one who ate the thing. So he’s going off about how many calories are in each doughnut (with specific numbers I choose not to include) and how much sugar there is, and how sugar will not only rot your teeth until you look like a homeless person and need dentures but also cause diabetes. Diabetes is it’s own rant that is mostly about neuropathy and amputation. But he never forgets to leave out how disgusting we’ll look with dimples above our elbows and calluses on our stomachs from our fat rolls rubbing together when we move. He’s now suggested that they skip dinner to make up for it because they have to be healthy for hockey. They’re 13 and 9! I don’t think he’ll actually make them skip dinner because he never has before with this, but he will make them feel guilty for eating it. And I’m so glad this isn’t directed at me because that would be so much worse, but this is so triggering to even hear through the door. The worst part is that I’m healthy enough that I would have probably had half of a doughnut and now I couldn’t even if there were any left because I just feel so sick to my stomach. 

As far as nature vs nurture goes, I’m going to have to vote nurture on this.

Thank you so much for reading, I just really need the support and I don’t think I can ask my friends because there’s always *something* terrible going on here and I’d imagine they’re pretty sick of hearing about it",1576966693,12/21/2019 16:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/edw81u/trigger_warning_time_for_some_pure_ed_bait_from/,8
3801,edvxc7,Is my cousin anorexic?,"Hello all, I apologise if this isn't the place to do this, or if I accidentally trigger anyone, hence why I marked it as trigger warning because that would be my last intention of this post.

Since the beginning of this year, my cousin (13F) has been acting.. Off about her weight. I'm only 5/6 months older than her, but have a few mental disorders myself so I understand how hard it is to be fighting through it.

Backstory here:
Her mother (my aunt) isn't the most understanding person. I'd say she's on the line of being verbally abusive at times, and my father and her have had multiple arguments and the such, leading to our families having a bit of a grudge. We used to see each other a ton when we were younger, we still do but not as much. We go to the same school also.
She likely wouldn't care if I brought this up to her, so I don't even think anyone would take me seriously.

I thought maybe I could bring it up to my parents but they were pretty much making fun of the whole disorder, which I told them was unacceptable as its very real and affects people in horrific ways, but they didn't really get it.

Back to now:
She's skipping lunch, and sometimes breakfast. She's stopped eating fast food and is obsessed with eating healthily. She has had a pretty dramatic weight drop and she was skinny before hand. I'm getting increasingly more worried, she's obviously not doing okay but we don't usually have serious conversations. We have had a few, but in general she's hard to get through, and is quite closed off.

So, I have a few questions. I am more than willing to personally help her through this, I'll do anything, and I will be consistently there for her. I know she'll have slips and I know it's not going to be easy, but I am more than willing. I also won't try and push her to recover, I know it's about being ready in your own right or it'll be hard, but I also want to make sure she's as safe as possible. 
How can I best help?
Is there any food I can get that she would eat more willingly?
How do you guys like to be talked to about the subject, do you find you get triggered easily or anything like that?
How do I start that conversation?


And, yes, i am trying my best to get an adult involved, but I don't want her to get worse by involving the wrong one.

Recent relapse over the summer due to life/grad school stress and now at my lowest weight since age 12 (BMI 15.5). I have a horrible issue with justifying eating with exercise and I have the complete inability to sit down at any time. If I sit, I am being ""lazy"" and therefore do not deserve food. Unfortunately, today I slept through my alarm and got up three hours later than intended. Add to that that today is a holiday travel day and I will spend the next 6-8 hours in various cars and planes. The feeling of total disgust with myself and anger that I allowed myself to be so lazy is unbearable. It is so ridiculous to feel this way but I can't help it. I literally don't deserve food, because I have been/will be so sedentary and disgusting today.

I weigh 100lbs and im still not happy with it because I want to be 6st 3 (87lbs) and I can’t do it. I don’t eat lunch or breakfast. My dinners are small. If I eat more than I should I’ll make up for it by not eating or being sick if I really have to. I’ll never ever go over 500kcal and if I do then I’ll be an ass to myself. I don’t know what to do. It’s getting harder and harder to lose weight and I hate it. I just want to be happy with myself but I don’t think I’ll ever be. Now I’m very worried because it’s Christmas and I’ll have to eat so people don’t notice and I’m panicking. It all started in May when I wanted to lose weight for a party, I started at 9st (126lbs) and lost around 16lbs in two and 1/2 weeks and then it just escalated and now i can barely eat without hating myself for it. My mum knows I’m dieting but not to the extent i do and everyone keeps telling me about how they’re fatter than me and they don’t know why I worry but they don’t realise that although they might be happy with that weight, I’m not happy with it. The only part that makes me feel better is when my family see me they’re always telling me about how I look slimmer but it goes away all so quickly.

3823,edf3vf,I reached my goal weight and now I'm sad and still losing.,"
Trigger warning-- there's measurements, proportions, and numbers on the scale ahead. 

I just need to rant real quick. I've had a really rough time and I started a diet to lose weight and love myself-- but with recent events in my life it turned more into self hatred and just being comforted by the lowering numbers on the scale. I now feel the pain of hunger as a kind of reminder that nobody really cares, but they might if I feel it long enough. 

I have a larger frame. I am tall (5'11) I have big boobs (32DDD) and an average butt, wide hips that have that annoying violin dip. My thighs don't touch. I started on November 8 at 155 and reached my goal weight of 135 a week ago, and have been slowly going down since. 

And I still have a gut. 

I am absolutely devastated, and I need comfort before I start trying to lose more and label a new goal weight. I'm sorry if I'm not in the right place for this. I just am going through a lot and want some support for this in a place where I won't be judged. I really dont want to promote bonespo or anything but I literally reached the weight where they said I would be my healthiest and my stomach still pokes out. I can't believe this. It is one of my biggest insecurities and it won't go away unless I am underweight. 

At least if I'm underweight my boyfriend might get concerned, but I don't want all the medical problems of being underweight. I am so sad and I can't eat or sleep right now. I just work myself to death on nothing productive and drink black coffee to get through the day.  I have relapsed pretty bad. I used to be anorexic shortly after I was malnourished, because I didn't like the way the new weight rested on my body when I started eating. 

I used to be starved without my consent, and I now do it by choice. I used to be neglected by my mother without my consent, and now I choose to stay with him. 

I hate myself so much, and almost want to just waste away until I'm tiny and I die.

I snapped and my voice stared choking up and I told him I would give the phone to my younger brother. Cause last time he called and I didn’t get it he told me to give the phone to my bro cause he puked know. 

I hung up on him and shouted at my bro to come out of the shower so he should talk to my dad. My dad called again and he told me to open the safe to get some money and while I was waiting for him to tell me which purse to take it from he sighed and send he would just ask his friend. I choked out an okay and started tearing up. My bro was done showering and asked if he should talk and  he saw me and he’s like are you okay and what happened. 

It’s not like I don’t like my brother or dad. I love them both so much and I know they love me too. I know my dad loves me a lot but it stills hurts when I see him come in at night and he kisses my brother goodnight and bends down and says it and he just says mine to me when he’s about to leave the room.

I remember bragging to my friend that I ate so less. I had no clue about disorders or that it could be dangerous. 
I found out and did a lot of research and became obsessed. Looking back at those pictures I remember at that time I would cringe and look away thinking I was fats but now I look at them and I want to go back to that. 
At the end of last year my exams came and with my ed ruling over me i couldn’t focus on studies so I told my self I was going on a ‘break’ and started eating normally. I was till okay weight and this year first few months. Then June holidays cane and I ate and over this whole year I’ve gained 10 kg and I ducking hate myself. I started cutting myself with those pointy things u draw circles with in math class, rulers and the end of of combs. I just dig enough to make a mark. A reminder. I don’t want to die. It’s just a form of a reminder for me. 

I hate myself and how I look so so much. I used to watch this show called super skinny vs supersize and they pull always drop the food that person has eaten that day into a tube and see what level it comes to or exchange with another person.

I lost all that in 6 months by eating no more than 400 calories a day but even at 125 I see no bones. I’m fat and literally my stomach is out and about. I have all this lose skin that looks fucking pathetic and I still can’t even feel my ribs. It’s all covered in fat. I’m literal fat. I thought since I’m 125 I would be closer to looking like a normal girl and be pretty but I see myself in the mirror and all I see is fat and skin. I’ve been having a shit ton of panic attacks because I almost break down each time I step on the scale and it shows no progress. I hate that wearing warm clothes puts on 2-3 pounds more on me and I just feel so disgusted. I can’t wear thin clothes or I’ll freeze to death. 
I thought I would have a banging body by 125. I look in the mirror and there’s a fucking fupa. And just fat and I know I’m repeating myself but I hate it. I want to cut it all off. I hate being this fat. I have a pair of jeans which literally is perfect but makes me look like I have a muffin top. I hate looking like I have a muffin top. I hate that my body looks like this. I really want to rip my skin apart. 

How can I get to 100lbs faster. I really can’t stand being this fat. 

Should I move to 200 calories a day? Would that help? 
I just get hungry sometimes and then throw up. I don’t like throwing up so I try to keep it below 400. I just... I eat one bite and my body refuses to stop and I feel so pathetic. 

I promise it’s never more than 400 calories but I’m still not losing weight fast enough. 

I really would rather die. I want it gone. I want to rip myself apart. I hate my body. It’s ugly and disgusting. 

My best friend is the only one I go to and it’s like she doesn’t even care. I tell her that I need help and she just... she’s too busy. Maybe because she’s fucking 100lbs herself. She starves herself and complains to me and I support her all the damn time. She doesn’t have an ed but I do! She’s fucking lucky as fuck to be that pretty and perfect while I struggle with food. 

I want to have pizza. It’s been 6 months since I had pizza but I know I’ll throw up. I just can’t. Calories scare me but I’m so hungry. 
I don’t wanna be the fat and ugly girl anymore. 

I want food. I really do. But it’s just that my mind wants it... not my body. Like I know I’ll be fine without food but I was a fatty. I was always teased about being fat. I was bullied. And food comforted me. And idk it’s like it’s been all taken away and my depression has gotten worse. 

I want food more for the emotional comfort rather than cuz I’m actually hungry. But I won’t eat it knowing that I’ll throw up and I have a bad reflex that won’t allow me to throw up until I have a whole fist down my throat. I hate it.

I think I may have gotten to a place where my period is either stopping, or stunted by my ED. It’s hard to tell thus far. I seem to have the regular symptoms of pms (including bloat), but as of today the blood level is a lot lower than usual. I’m prone to irregularity though, so this could be normal. 

My question is, what happens when you lose your period to your ED? Is it a slow process? Like, you bleed less or only spot? Or does it just never come? Do other symptoms persist? Anyone have any firsthand experience with this? I’d love to hear what happened. 

EDIT: Another question: does it have to do with BMI, or general calorie intake?

3849,ecq3q5,I don’t know who I am anymore.,"I’ve(M21) dealt with disordered  eating habits through high school starting after my first relationship was toxic and I was raped, but I never had a full on disorder. I am now starting to deal with the fact that it happened(I was 16 and I never told anyone till 3 months ago). Over these few months, I’ve developed and have been diagnosed with anorexia. I knew I had a problem when I couldn’t help but throw up after every meal and just focus on food and weight for most of my day. I knew I had an eating disorder, but to actually hear my psychiatrist officially diagnose me felt so weird. I’ve lost 35 pounds in 3 months. What people don’t tell you is when you starve yourself to the point that your body eats away at your muscle, it fucking hurts. I’m in constant pain all the time. I can barely carry groceries to the door without feeling that I just worked out for hours. You’d think all these symptoms and consequences of anorexia would help me to push myself to get better, but I still purge almost every day. Diet Coke and Coke Zero is a meal to me. I don’t look emaciated, but I know it’s only a matter of time. I want to be able to say I can overcome this, but it’s so hard when every waking moment is spend on food. I don’t know where I’m going with this. I just can’t fall asleep because I’m so bony that my bed is uncomfortable, so I thought I’d put my thoughts on here. To anyone(girl or boy, adult or child) on here that is struggling and sees this, you are enough. You are beautiful and you can overcome this. I don’t know you, but I love you. I love you people on this sub. I see and feel the pain of all of you, but we can get through this.

I’m not underweight, and part of me wants to make the effort to avoid triggers and try to recover mentally, but the other part of me wants to dive deeper into it. It really is like an addiction, but I know that if I made the effort I could stop. I don’t think I want to. 

I also have not talked to anyone about this subject, and I’ve hidden it from my therapist like it’s something I’m deeply ashamed of.

3855,eins82,Should I be worried?,"A few months ago I loved eating. I was quite healthy and didn't have that many problems with my body. 
I don't know what changed that. Suddenly food disgusts me and the feeling of being full makes me sick. I absolutely hate my body and myself even more. I've been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses and spent three months at a mental hospital specialized in eating disorders (even though I still have no idea why I was sent there since at that time I had no problems with food). A few weeks ago I began looking up the amount of calories in my food and the numbers ruined my already low appetite. Others always tell me that I should eat more because I'm so skinny but I feel like I am fat and ugly and that nobody will ever love me if I look like this. I try to eat at least something so my mother doesn't worry about me and drags me to a doctor. They would probably send me to that same hospital and that's the last thing I want because it was so horrible. Yesterday I tried eating my favorite dish in an attempt to gain back my love for food. It backfired. It just made things worse. I couldn't even eat half of it and I already felt utterly disgusting. Now I just don't want to eat anything at all.
I'm not sure if I'm developing an eating disorder. Nonetheless I'm worried about my health but even more about my body. I forgot what being hungry feels like. So I'm asking for advise. Should I be worried?

2. If I have a day where I binge i wouldn’t want to see them for about three days until my stomach de bloats and I’ve had time to do exercise, which would obviously impact the relationship

3869,eiaval,Boyfriend left me because I was too much to take care of,"Hey y'all, happy 2020. I'm still in shock and crying from getting dumped yesterday. 

My boyfriend is 24 and finishing his bachelors this summer and is going to apply for jobs in computer science afterwards. I met him because he works at my community college and it was love at first sight. We had a 6 hour first date and didn't stop talking for ages. I went away for the summer and he watched my pet while I was away, and when I came back I started sleeping over at his house more and more. 

He was very insistent that he didn't want me to move in and that mon-wed and the weekends together was great, but he needed more space. 

I was always honest with him about my recovery. I slipped a few times with not eating and told him how much he helped. I was always very grateful when he did the dishes and cooked for me, just as much as he was grateful when I would cook for him. 

I got a bit too housewifey, even though I work and go to school, and I think it scared him off. He's always been the sort of person where he defines success based on having a good career, I've always wanted a good home. 

When breaking up with me, he said he couldn't stand knowing that if he forgets to pack me lunch or bring me a snack that I just don't eat. It made him so sad to know that I only eat in front of others that it weighed on him. He said it felt like walking on eggshells and that he couldn't open up when he knew how bad I was some days. He said that the good times were good but he simply stopped loving me and didn't see us together in the future.

Sigh.

I miss him, I love him, and I'm doing insane person math to try and figure out how long it will take for him to miss me. If anyone else is insane, I'd really appreciate psychoanalyzing his fear of commitment getting in the way of his career with you. Fuck.

But I purposely gained those 3 pounds back because my ass &amp; tits are gross. (am I a fake anorexic?) 

Well, now I have no ass, no tits. The thing now is to be curvy. &amp; I’m getting older (almost 22, which I find to be such an adult age) &amp; I want to be womanly &amp; curvy. So I gained 3 lbs. still keeping me underweight but a little less bony. Where am I going with this? 

Does anyone else have this awful fucking pull between anorexia &amp; wanted to have boobs &amp; an ass. 
I want to be sexy. Not a bag of bones. But I wanna be classified as underweight because if not who tf am I. 

And i can’t do the belly thing. I’m underweight &amp; still look pregnant. 

How tf am I ever gonna be beautiful if I can’t not look grossly skinny without hating myself. 
I think my girlfriend hates me because I’m too skinny. Does she feel like she’s fucking a plank? Poor girl. Good thing my sex drive is gone. 

Does anyone have tips on this insanity? When I was younger I wanted to be skin &amp; bone. But now I’m older &amp; everyone’s all curvy &amp; womanly &amp; im a fucking small boy.

3897,ehh9fl,Friends and anorexia,"So I know my friends are suspicious that I’m struggling with AN as I’m in college and I spend most my time around them. They ask me about what I ate that day and try to encourage me to eat when I say I’m not hungry. I’m particularly concerned about my roommate who knows I don’t eat even more than the others because shes at home with me during the day and I don’t cook or anything. It makes me sad that they are worried about me, and I feel like a burden. They are also always telling me that they are there for me if I ever want to talk about anything. Today my roommate asked me if I was eating enough. I know I’m really lucky to have friends who’re so worried about me and care, but I just don’t know what to do anymore. Also Christmas was really bad and I binged a lot so I know my restricting will only get worse in the next few weeks. I hate the thought that people are pitying me or worried about me and I know that they are talking to each other about my disorder. Which everyone knows the worse thing in the world is friends talking about you when you’re not there. It just makes me really sad and stressed out, because I’m afraid that my annoyance or repeated denial whenever they bring up food will eventually push them away. I’m just dreading the day that one of them actually confronts me in a very up front way because that will be incredibly hard. I don’t know why it makes it so much worse when someone points it out. I know I have anorexia but anytime anyone mentions anything about me not eating enough or concerns about my weight loss I just get really angry and defensive completely lying to them and insisting I’m fine. That’s the thing about anorexia compared to other mental disorders, the sufferer usually doesn’t WANT to get better. Someone with PTSD wants to recover. Someone with anxiety wants to recover. I do not want to get better, because it means weight gain, it means giving up control of something that I’ve been controlling for so long. I hope I can get to a point where I want to get better because I know that recovery and treatment isn’t possible if that doesn’t happen.",1577681059,12/29/2019 22:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ehh9fl/friends_and_anorexia/,3
3898,ehh5hi,My disorder is eating me 💔,"Hi. This is my first time admitting this but I am a previous survivor of anorexia. I use to starve myself back in my teens and I'm an adult now. It's been years since I went to the ER for fainting at school. I was eating 1/2 can of Campbells chicken noodle soup and walking 4 miles every day. I ate laxatives with it. I would only nibble on berries and nuts. My bus driver even saw me after 1 summer of doing that and said ""you look sick. Is everything at home alright?"". The problem wasn't at home, but in my head. I snapped out of it and started eating again and working to a healthy weight but I always had fear of getting fat. I'm now in my late 20s and I am showing signs of it again. I just went through the roughest break up (or break?? Idk) and I wasn't eating before we split. Its been about 4 days now and I fell back into my soup and berry nibble habit. I can't go completely without food now since I work 9 hour shifts 5/7 days a week, but I have absolutely no appetite. At all. I know I'm depressed about my break up but I don't want to relapse. Does anyone have advice on how to survive this depression and tips on eating again.

3907,eh51iz,TW - what's your biggest trigger?,"I had to complain about mine and maybe complaining about yours might help you too. The rest of this post will be discussing mothers and poorly informed people when it comes to eds. Please don't read on if you think this might trigger you. Also it's very long and written on phone. My biggest trigger is my mum and I feel so bad about it. She's not very informed with eating disorders or how to handle them. For context I have suffered with body image and, looking back now, an unhealthy relationship with food since I can remember. I've always been on the higher side of a normal bmi if not considered overweight so when I started restricting heavily last year my mum congratulated me on losing so much in a month. At the end of one month of restricting I told my mum about the problem and that was my first mistake. I had built myself up for it so much, planned to do it in the car so I couldn't escape and hoped that having someone on my side would help. Her first reaction - ""did it hurt?"" Okay not so bad, coulda been more supportive but hey at least it isn't insensitive or anything like th- ""I thought you were smarter than that."" Ouch. Okay that one kinda hurt. Then next came what was present throught my whole ""recovery."" (It was a shit excuse for recovery just one appointment with some ass who did nothing than said I needed to gain weight again then saw the horror in my eyes, pointed it out and proceeded to not push for any actual help with it.) She had recently been through stomach band surgery and she asked ""is it because of me?"" This annoyed me so much because yes mum part of my ed is because of you but no not because of that. Because you feed me shit everyday when I was younger and I grew to hate myself. Then at like the age of 7 I kept that fact from you because you always leaned on me for emotional support since I can remeber and ever since the days you started to use me as your therapist I guess I haven't been able to open up to you. I know you where depressed, I know you were struggling too and I love helping you but jesus when your 8 year old daughter asks you ""is it normal to cry when you look in the mirror?"" You don't respond with ""depends on the circumstances."" And ignore it. You ask, y the fuck is my 8 yr old crying in the fucking mirror at herself hating herself? This is really long and there's more I could go over but to keep this actually readable I shall finish with some gems that have come in the past year of binging and emotional eating, till my relapse into reatriction now. 1 - you were wasting my food? That I slaved over for you? 2 - I thought I had taught you better and, my personal favorite, 3 - rants about how hard this is for her and guilt triping me into somehow supporting her ontop of planting her body insecurities on top of mine, telling all her friends without my permission. commenting on how much im eating and everything in between. Though you are sweet mum and I love you very much I wish I hadn't gone to you with this. Maybe I wouldn't have relapsed.
Thanks for reading this big ass rant, writing this lifted a weight off of my shoulders. Share your biggest trigger, it helps.",1577619579,12/29/2019 5:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/eh51iz/tw_whats_your_biggest_trigger/,3

3916,egzao1,So I wrote another thing,"somewhere silent, 
there’s an empty room

and I am a shadow in the corner,
a something of a girl

how does the floor 
creak when I move?

how can a ghost 
weigh anything at all?

I am a small breath of a person,
a fleeting glimpse of a someone,

I am not sure I’m even here

this small thing slips from bed,
to shower,
to window,

slips from page to page to page,
weaves string and plastic
around her bones, to
see if she still exists

the soft swish of cloth 
in the silence is deafening

the hum of hunger and static
burns my eyes, 
breaks my back,
brings me to my knees,

forces my hand.

I could say this is private, 
and quiet, 
and gentle

but the bloodied hands, 
the bruised spine,
the nail marks across my stomach, 
are not private

the body that I can never recognize,
no matter how much I change it,
how much I force it to fit my molds,
Is not gentle 

somewhere silent,
there is this small voice,
insidious, it hisses in my ear
and down my neck

wired like a marionette, 
how do I do anything else
but what it wants?

sometimes it’s the only 
thing I can hear",1577581879,12/28/2019 19:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/egzao1/so_i_wrote_another_thing/,2

3931,egmo96,My friend and I are both anorexic; lately she has started lying about her weight &amp; BMI - claiming it to be lower than it objectively obviously is. Really not sure how to deal with this. Help. **NO NUMBERS MENTIONED**,"My friend and I have known each other for a long time. She's a good friend of mine but ever since she started lying about having a lower weight, I've felt like the friendship may be becoming toxic for me. I know she's lying about her weight as we are about the same height, with the same build and the same age. The lying started when we hung out after not seeing each other for a while and she noticed that I was more emaciated then she is (i am not trying to brag, I'm just trying to be objective - I'm actually attempting to convince myself into recovery right now). Now, by no means do i think she is faking her ED, in fact i know she's not. But she does like to over exaggerate for attention. It wasn't something that bugged me until this fiasco. It feels like she wants a competition with me but needs to feel like she's ""winning"" and is willing to straight up lie to me while also totally disregarding my mental well being. It feels like she's trying to make me feel bad about myself in order to feel good about herself. 
I'm not sure what to do. Talking about it doesn't seem like the best option since we both do have anorexia. I don't want her out of my life -- I love her.

(They know about my disorder and are worried) Then as if dinner wasn’t enough I was asked to eat a peice of pie afterwards! They cut me a small piece but it was still too much. After I ate half of that I stated I was really full so they let k en off the hook. Then when I returned home later I was forced to eat dinner agin! I said I’m still full from dinner at my friends house but they made me eat anyway. I was almost in tears. I ate 4 Brussel sprouts and refused to eat any more. My family kept asking me to eat more but I was crying by this point. Then I had a full as meltdown at the table when they asked me to eat again. Then they finally backed off.

3958,eg4d86,I’m obese and anorexic,"TW: numbers, depression, suicidal thoughts, BMI 

I am obese. I don’t “look the part”, I guess; but I am.  I’m starting a weight loss journey but I’ve quickly realized that it’s mostly fueled by my disordered thoughts.  I used to binge eat and attempted purging but always failed. I was severely depressed and suicidal. I’m an attempt survivor. I went to 3 inpatient psychiatric hospital stays as well as 8 weeks out patient. I managed to gain 20 or so pounds within 3 months and reached my heaviest weight of 191. I couldn’t handle it anymore and I couldn’t keep being a pig so my brain was like oh let’s hate ourselves and start starving. So I stopped eating lunch at school and avoided dinner at all costs. I even skipped breakfast but it wasn’t the move lol. Winter break started so I told my family I’m starting a weight loss journey and my dad immediately told my mom to stop forcing me to eat dinner. In fact my dad is inspired by my control. He thinks it’s awesome that I eat ~1000 cals a day max. He thinks it’s awesome that I walk at least 10,000 steps a day and burn at least 2560. I’m an inspiration. But I hate my self. I can’t eat food without seeing calories, cholesterol, trans fat, etc. I can’t eat a thousand calories without burning at least double. If my weight goes up on the scale I feel like the world is gonna end. I hate it. I wish I could express this to them but I’m doing well. I’m eating healthy. I’m working out. I’m losing weight. I currently have a BMI of 31.75. I’m killing my self if I stay fat. But I’m saving my life by losing it. It sucks. I’m just gonna be another success story. And who knows if I keep starving myself after I reach my goal weight. Will they start caring.

3959,eg43t5,Speculating," hi I'll open it with I recently moved out of my parents since then I've been hoarding food in my apartment every time I go to any store I have the compulsion to buy more food even though theres literally plenty at home and despite doing so I have been near starving myself I don't know why I've been hoarding all of the food and not eating it but on days where i get really stressed I tend to binge a little bit and the times where I do feel hungry when I cook I look at it and I suddenly just don't want to eat it and oddly enough after being completely full like I literally can't have anymore I crave things like crazy. Im speculating I must be malnourished or something. I used to have an eating disorder and an unhealthy obsession with counting calories a year back 
I check my weight at least three or four times a week since then I remain a pretty healthy BMI. but I still want to be thinner and I find myself reading a lot into fasting  and think about how much I want to do it or start to plan to but unfortunately I no longer have the luxury because I work at a warehouse so calories kinda are needed in order for energy, when I used to live at my house and some days I still do this, I have the tendency to skip breakfast even before work and I have totally gotten accustomed to not eating for very long periods of time even during work and even when given the opportunity I don't feel sick or empty I just exist like this, is there something wrong with me?",1577409326,12/26/2019 19:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/eg43t5/speculating/,0

3962,efyvad,My metabolism is so damaged-Christmas edition,"TW-calorie counts 

I try to tell everyone that I will gain weight if I eat more than 500 calories, and they refuse to believe me. It’s true. My metabolism is so damaged that if there are days that I eat 600-700, I will gain at least 3 pounds. Christmas was really difficult. I spent the day with my boyfriends family yesterday and had a wonderful time, but I made a careless mistake. I weighed myself in my boyfriends bathroom, and the scale said I gained like 7 pounds. (It was manual so it was hard to get an exact number) Prior to Christmas I was eating a lot more than usual for approx 4 days-500 calories a day. And I gained 7 pounds?! I got out of breakfast yesterday by using the old “I already ate” excuse, which my boyfriend wasn’t going to try to deny in front of everyone, but he knew. He was like “you already ate”? In a somewhat sarcastic manner, like he knew I was lying. I then only ate a few strawberries, grapes and half my plate of salad at Christmas dinner and his whole family was looking at me like I am a maniac. Everyone kept trying to offer me food. I then slipped up and drank a glass of wine and I have been beating myself up over it ever since. I avoid alcohol because of the high calorie count. If I do drink, I have like one shot or two and I am pretty much drunk since I don’t ever have anything in my stomach. 

After weighing myself I just felt so worthless all day yesterday. I felt disgusting, like I didn’t deserve to be in company of wonderful people who care about me. When we took the family picture in front of the tree I just wanted to run and hide. I kept telling my boyfriend to stand further in front of me and he wouldn’t. He is very tiny, and I’m not. I look bigger than him, especially by standing in front of him for the picture. All I could keep thinking is that I am going to fast until New Years, because by next Christmas I NEED to be so much thinner for that picture. But deep down I know that there won’t be another Christmas with him and his family if I keep this up...I have lost myself. I lost the one thing he loved most about me, which was my intelligence. I can’t even think straight now half of the time. I can’t write coherent sentences. We played this complex board game later on and I couldn’t keep up because I’m so malnourished...my brain is dying. I lied and said I was tired and faked falling asleep in the middle of the game because I was embarrassed. It made me feel like absolute shit, even more so because we were playing with his stepdad who is a professor, and I want to make a good impression on him. His stepdad kept saying that he needs to play this game with his two other kids because they are “smart enough” and would have a lot of fun with it. The voice inside my head kept taunting me the whole game for not being “smart enough” anymore. In the midst of the game I began having suicidal thoughts. (I am safe-no active plan. I just feel worthless) I’m losing myself. I’m losing my boyfriend. I think he’s having an emotional affair with a coworker-someone that can intellectually stimulate him in a way that I just can’t anymore. 

I know I don’t eat a lot but I feel like I eat way too much. I feel like I have eaten like a pig the past few days at an avg. of 500 calories a day. I hate this. I hate what I have become. 
I’m in the midst of a 107 hour fast because I feel guilty about 3 days of 500 calories and a glass of wine. It would be 7 days or longer if I wasn’t going to a friends house on the 30th who I know will force-feed me. 

Someone just fucking take this away from me so everything and everyone I love isn’t taken away from me-including myself. This illness has taken me by its hands and has pulled me out of my very own body.

*update* I weighed myself at the gym (the scale I usually weigh myself on-my boyfriend took my home scale :/) and I actually lost 2 pounds. I must have read the other scale wrong because I was drunk and had to do it quickly so no one would know.

I’m scared I’ll never stop gaining weight. I’m scared. It’s almost like I’m scared to be happy. I feel like I’m not sick enough ever. I watch documentaries about eating disorders and tell myself I don’t actually need help because I’m not *that* sick because I don’t do a, b, c that these people do. Literally told myself my ed is not that bad because I don’t smear food in my hair like the girls in the doc about the 8 year old anorexic. I don’t think calories will seep into my skin from touching food (but maybe it does cross my mind that I shouldn’t smell high calorie/fat/sugar foods because then I’ll want to eat them). I don’t weigh my foods. I basically just restrict calories (and sugar, sodium, fat on a lesser scale. Don’t have a limit but avoid things high in those), purge and over exercise, weigh myself 10 times a time, and hate myself. But I don’t do *those things*. So I can’t be sick right? Some sick twisted part of my brain wants to do those things. Otherwise my ed will have been “wasted” if I recover. My therapist said the other day “your brain is not broken” but I don’t think I believe her. Is this why I can’t recover? Because I have this sick twisted idea that my eating disorder will only be “worthwhile” if I am doing even more? How can an eating disorder even be “worthwhile”. I’m literally killing myself by eating less than 500 calories a day, often nothing but some change from coffee creamer which I’m trying to wean off of because it’s sugary and has calories so obviously “bad”. I’m killing myself by exercising full body workouts for at least half an hour when I haven’t eaten anything for 30 hours.

3989,ell5pd,Dad wants me to lose weight,"I'm currently trying recovery, and my parents are unaware I ever struggled with this since I've been away for college for a year. However, now that I came home for the winter holidays my dad won't stop commenting on how much weight I've gained and is sending me to a nutritionist tomorrow. 

He's been sending me to nutritionists since I was 9 (10 years now) and bothering me about my weight since forever. All his comments are making it really hard to stay in track with recovery, especially during the holidays. 

Idk I'm just so tired of this and tomorrow's appointment is making me super anxious. I'd appreciate any support or suggestions.

EDIT: I have clarified bellow why I can't refuse treatment and/or report her. Upon analyzing, I've also realized my biggest source of anxiety is my dad, not necessarily the appointment, so if anyone has any tips on how to make my weight appear smaller on the scale, as well as body fat % and/or measurements that'd be super helpful.

I'm just realizing in these days how much bad my ed could be. I didnt even realize I was losing control until my parents sat down with me and talked to me. My mother is a doctor and she noticed stuff, that I lost weight, that I vomited, that I'm reluctant to eat.

I'm confused. Half of me knows there's something off, the other half likes my body the way it is. I'm aware of the fact that vomiting is not ok, but I do feel better eating less. I accepted to get help because honestly I never have energy to do anything and I'm always in a bad mood. 

Also,in the past months I noticed so many weird things like insomnia, anxiety, nervousness over any small little thing, me wanting to be a hermit and not wanting to be with anyone, and over exercising, and I feel that these are not ok behaviour. 

Has anyone felt like that? As a med student I'm aware of the fact I fucked up my hormones and these are the reasons for feeling like this, apart from fasting. I do want to feel ok but I'm so scared to be overweight. I was overweight years ago, and I love looking skinny. But I want to be also healthy. 

I'm sorry for the stupid amount of infos put in a random way. I'm just very confused and scared. Thanks",1578325412,1/6/2020 9:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ekvrmj/confused_and_anxious_about_everything_i_feel/,4

Well I finally got my “control” back. Ate nothing yesterday and exercised. Got up early and exercised today. Even did my hair and makeup. My weight is almost down to where it was before Christmas.

I was having a difficult time getting past the calories, deciding what to get, ANDI felt rushed. A recipe for a huge overwhelming feeling that I could not shake. My eyes began to fill with tears and I knew I couldn’t hold them back. I didn’t wanna cry in front of my parents and I definitely did not wanna cry in front of strangers all bc of a goddamn menu. Right before I thought I was going to lose it I walked over to my step mom and shared my struggle. However, once I started talking the tears started to stream down my face. How embarrassing I thought. I tried to run and hide from the situation, but before I could flee my dad held me close and told me it was okay and that I didn’t have to get anything. It was comforting despite still feeling shameful. Once we sat down my stepmom asked what triggered me getting upset. I told her and she offered to let me look at a menu for as long as I needed while we sat at the table. I looked at the menu again but I just couldn’t bring myself to eat anything, though I was hungry. Ana has a tight hold on me and she made sure I remembered today in front of everyone.

But it was really not the best meal and i feel like im being punished for allowing myself to even eat it when i was trying to fast. I could’ve done more to not eat it like I used to, but I didn’t want her to catch on and get upset with me. I feel disgusting. I feel like my stomach is going to explode at any second and im just going to die fat and disgusting. I want it to come out. But i have to go to work now and i wont be able to purge there.

It was just a few months ago that I was fasting for days on end and I was unstoppable. Let’s just say I went from being morbidly obese to average. I went from not even being able to buy any clothes at all to a size M in most stores. Until my family convinced me I needed to eat. “Too skinny” they said. Are you fucking kidding me??? I was pathetic enough to believe them. So I ate. And ate and ate and ate and ate. I gained nearly half the weight i lost back and nothing fits me. My once favorite pants can’t even come past my knees. Shirts that hung loose are now tight and suffocating. I unbutton the pants I wear now whenever I sit down.

4057,ejtr2b,Is it possible to be happy with anorexia?,"*DISCLAIMER* I am by no means trying to glorify eating disorders, I find that behaviour very toxic. This is just my experience, and read at your own risk.

I am not diagnosed with anorexia, and I never go around saying that I have it. I do however relate to almost everything in this reddit, and I just put anorexia in the title because I can’t put this whole disclaimer in the title. I hope you understand.

Anyhow, I have been feeling inspired to take more control of my life, alongside the food. I plan to continue extensive starvation, and strive to be able to reject food. It has come to my attention though, that anorexia is closely related to depression, anxiety and stuff like that. 

I have no issue with that, but I am just wondering if I am able to control both my life AND the calorie-terrified voice in my head. I’m happy living this way so far.

While I want to create a living for myself, and want to begin getting back into achieving high grades, I’m also motivated to starve and stay underweight.

Can an actual anorexic person have motivation for anything other than food, like I do?

Does this mean I shouldn’t consider myself to have a disordered view of food and carry on since I’m content like this?

Let me know if I didn’t clear anything up enough. Thank yaaa. Stay happy.😁☺️",1578124099,1/4/2020 1:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ejtr2b/is_it_possible_to_be_happy_with_anorexia/,20

Right now i am underweight and i am very happy with how i look but i also want to gain weight so my family can stop worrying about me so i started eating more and try to not count calories.
Today i weighted myself and saw i gained, still underweight but seeing the number higher made me question is it possible to recover this fast?
My family already thinks everything will get sorted out when i finally gain weight and they really don't understand the mental part even though I tried to explain this to them many times.
Now, gaining weight feels like i have been faking my whole disorder and i was just seeking attention. I don't want my family and people around me to think what i have been feeling was fake.
Is t possible to eat without guilt or shame in a matter of weeks even though i am afraid of gaining weight?",1577987949,1/2/2020 11:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ej1lsr/am_i_recovering_too_fast/,7

4115,eiuwdq,What should I do about my wife.,"So my wife suffers from from anorexia.  In January last year she was admitted to a in patient clinic for a few weeks and then continued as an out patient for awhile longer.  It got to the point when they needed her to come in more often than she was but was unable due to work commitments.  We got her a councilor who she sees weekly.  I was starting to feel that things were getting back to normal.  Then a couple of weeks ago she got a package from a supplement company.  I thought it was just some protein powder or something but nothing appeared on the regular shelf were the rest of my stuff sits.  
I did a little snooping and found weightloss pills in one of her draws.  I was hoping for a little assistance on how to approach this with her.
Other things to note she saw the anorexia coming herself and talked to the doctor when it appeared and this is not her first time suffering from it.  Also she mentioned that her boobs were coming back when I said that's great she was less than happy.

Today I got my original gw .I haven’t weighed this little since 8th grade and I’m now a junior. I feel somewhat attractive now but I don’t want to stop. I want to be underweight. At the beginning of the summer I knew I had gained weight because I could feel it but I didn’t know how noticeable it was. One of my close friends mentioned to me “you’ve gained weight but it looks so healthy.” I guess I’m a really sensitive person because I would NEVER say something like that to anyone. I never mention anyone’s weight to them because I know what it’s like to feel self conscious. I guess that just triggered it all and I went from skipping meals to now heavy restricting. Today I just binged a lot for the first time in about a month and I feel so awful about it. I just drank a lot of water to see if that would help my stomach settle but it hasn’t. Tomorrow I’ve promised myself I’m not eating anything. I want to feel what I felt on the scale this morning.

4131,ep7ypc,yet another poem,"when the morning fog kisses the window,
she tumbles from my bed,
all legs and eyes,
silent footsteps on
tiled graves, weights sewn into the bottoms of her feet

she whispers in the steam around the mirror, 
finds me in my sleep and pries my lips apart,
fills me with these things that I can’t remember how to get rid of,
no matter how empty I am 

her siren songs wake me from shadows.
she sleeps in the divots across my ribs,
she makes her home in the valley between my hips

is it her iced hands or mine that crawl up and down the ladder of my spine? caresses the yielding curve of my tailbone? 

I can no longer tell her grasp from my own

so who is it keeping me hostage?

I want to say she is forcing my hand,
this small whisper in the steam around the mirror,
her mantras a safety net branded across my skin, 
comfort screwed and clamped into my bones,
and God, am I afraid

and I want to say this is not my fault,
not my will,
that this is out of my control-

-but those whispers in the steam,
those bruising fingers.

they look a lot like mine.",1579120390,1/15/2020 14:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ep7ypc/yet_another_poem/,2

about a week ago, i found out i’m pregnant. honestly, i’m overjoyed. my menstrual cycle has been out of whack for a long time due to my ED and taking plan b a couple times. my coworker with endometriosis was concerned because i would tell her about it and she thought i had endo as well and with that comes infertility. 

all i’ve ever wanted to be was a mother. and i was going to wait until i was about 25, but after one of my other mental disorders got worse, i got reckless. and now i’m pregnant with a child to a guy that’s not even my boyfriend anymore, has a kid to be born any day now, no car or license...needless to say, it was a bad choice. but regardless, i intend on keeping it and raising it as best as i can. 

i’m really early in, only three and a half weeks, and i already eat and sleep a lot more, as well as breast growth (as i expected). but now that i see i’m gaining, all i want to do is starve, throw up and exercise. i really don’t want to lose the child because it’ll destroy me. but the weight gain is going to drive me insane. 

my question is if there’s any mothers on this sub that have gone through something similar and how to deal with it. i’ve bought some healthy foods to eat but i’m attracted to ramen noodles and dill pickle chips for who knows what reason. any advice will help greatly :)",1579053680,1/14/2020 20:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/eovkpv/im_pregnant_and_i_dont_think_i_can_deal_with_the/,3

Her parents have told me on multiple occasions that our time together really helps her.

However, I've had feelings for her for years. Everyone tells me to just ask her out, ""what's the worst that could happen?"".

I don't see it like that. If I ask her out and it ruins the friendship, that can't possibly help her well-being. Awful for me too.

I can wait, I'd much rather her be happy.

4161,eonu7e,Where do I go from here?,"Hi! 
First post on reddit so let me know if I do this wrong. Not really sure what this post is except a hope that writing this out and others opinions will help me figure out what to do next. So me: anorexia since age 15, now mid 20s, nursing school, long hour and lots of pressure/responsibilty. Spent the last ten years or so maintaining a weight that was just below normal but didnt attract attention/concern, with multiple relapses down to pretty bad weights (bmi XX probably) that required family interventions (no formal treatment ever). Dur to family/relationship/school stress and drama over last year, ive completely relapsed down to my lowest weight again. My parents are now living with me part time to “keep an eye on me” which basically means we just argue about what I eat and how much I work out, and nothing changes. Their hearts are in the right place and they have tried to help for years, but they do t understand that critisicm and anger just dont help. Been in individual therapy with eating disorder therapist since last august and have only gotten worse since then. Her philosophy is very much that I am supposed to take control and choose to get better. I mean sure yeah that would be great, but if i could just choose to get better then there wouldnt be a problem in the first place right? So over the last few weeks thing have just plumeted. Weight still low, struggling to not add more exercise (literally my only coping mechanism in life), fight with the parents and as of last week therapist dropping me to recommend inpatient therapy because she just doesnt think i can change. Meanwhile my head is as dark as it has ever been since this started. I feel no way out at all. Stress of school is rising, extreme pressure from my parents to just fix this already. Ive become obsessed with my weight which is a new problem. Never really been my focus (more about feeling control/safe). Now i weigh every mornjng and it literally dictates my day. Im right on the border of crossing into a new weight zone (as in being X9 to X0) which is completely destroyjng my head. I want to get better but on the days i cross over into higher weight i physically cannot eat. This dark blanket of delression, anger, doubt over takes me. Im actually physically ill with nausea and shaking. I can plan out all these perfect weight gain plans but when it comes down to actually doing jt i cant because im so afraid of that feeling bc once that feeling has taken over there is no way to make it stop. Im sick the whole day, i cant function at work or school bc all these dark feelings just take over my head. I become a terrible person. I feel like every tkme i try to get help for this problem i get a million times worse. 

Wow that got long- i guess my question is i have these options-

- gain a little weight so everyone leaves me alone and go back to the routine controlled, no food variety, “safe” comfort zone that ive lived in for ten years

- figure out a way to get past these feelings on my own (no therapist now) and probably fail (bc i gain one pound and slip back twenty steps)

- my parents want me to drop out of school and get more help (not an option jn my opinion) 

- any other ideas....???

Anyway, i would love some ideas on what to do. Feeling very lost. Thanks for reading",1579020684,1/14/2020 10:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/eonu7e/where_do_i_go_from_here/,2

4163,eomsiu,Recovery Rant,"I’ve just started day hospital last week after several previous attempts and hospitalizations. I know this time is different because I’ve taken time off school because I just wasn’t functioning anymore. I’m motivated and I know I have to do this. On the flip side I’m seeing my bones disappear already, there’s already thickening of my skin and I am stuck in an endless thought loop of distress about what’s happening. I know I’m going to go back and eat the meals with nurses tomorrow but I’m disgusted by myself already and it’s only 4 days in.

I got weighed today and they said I’d need about 2-3 weeks to restore weight before I can move downstairs to the outpatient clinic, that alone makes my disordered brain think I hadn’t starved enough before and then I feel stupid for even being here. I know I need the help and I know if I kept going I would end up having a medical event that would take my choice away but I’m terrified I won’t be able to accept the growing body. What if I allow this weight restoring to happen only to realize I can’t live in my body like this but also know I can’t keep living (although damnit I want to) in a tired, irritated, hair loss, weak, anti social, unproductive state.

This is a rant, and for that I’m sorry, I’m just sitting here after voluntarily eating a snack (I’m supposed to do a night snack as part of the program) everything in me is telling me I didn’t really need questioning absolutely everything and quite honestly the current worth of me and my body.

I now have a bmi in the low healthies but a couple of days ago I broke down crying after I saw myself in the mirror and saw just how fat I have become in my eyes. I am just so unhappy with the way I look, I don't know what to do anymore. 

A couple of days ago I went in to get my values checked which seem to be very inaccurate to me (fat percentage, muscle percentage). Basically very little fat and a lot of muscle, but I genuinely DON'T look like that. However i just can't stop myself restricting anymore. It's like that one single breakdown has overthrown everything I've been building over the past months.

I am now in my exam weeks in law school. It's my final year of my bachelors and I have so much to do but I just sit in the library hungry every day and I can't focus but if I eat I cry. Today I had a brownie cause i thought i was gonna faint and i have literal tears in my eyes about this stupid brownie as I type this.

I just don't understand. I KNOW I value my education more than I do my weight. I just don't get why I am messing everything up so much and I am so stressed and I feel so alone (I live by myself).

4213,en61oj,Ever met someone who glorifies eating disorders?,"My best friend of 15 years has recently claimed to have an eating disorder. 

In no way do I want to diminish that or downplay what she’s going through. 

I remember when my eating disorder started at 16. I forced myself into it. I remember I thought it was a way to see how far I can push my limits. It was like a contest with myself. I remember how good it felt to lose weight &amp; I remember how fucking awful it felt to be so damn hungry. 

I try to remember how I felt when dealing with her... I don’t want her to become as sick as me. I try to warn her but she thinks it’s some fucking joke. 

I fear that when I eat around her she thinks I’m “healthy”

I want to recover, although it’s not going well, but I feel as though my desire to recover makes her think I’m not sick. I fear that when I’m bloated she thinks I’m a fake. I fear that even though I’m very underweight she doesn’t see that. 

Why am I so fucking concerned about what she thinks? Why is my ex posting things dogging super skinny girls knowing that I’m literally deteriorating from this? Why do I feel like a giant fucking joke who can’t even eat five bites of food without hating myself? 

&amp; why the fuck is my best friend thinking anorexia is some type of fucking fun. I try to tell her “dude, this is NOT what u want” but she doesn’t listen. She continues to talk about how she wants to fast. 

I don’t even fucking fast, I just don’t fucking eat at all... god, I wish I could just fucking fast &amp; then resume eating. 

Sorry this is all over the place &amp; im a train wreck. 

What do I do? Has anyone else experienced this? It’s not fucking cute to be “2 best friends with an eating disorder” 

Like no bitch I wanna fucking eat some pizza &amp; not hate myself &amp; have a god damn panic attack. 

Why is she glorifying this? Do people with eating disorders tend to brag &amp; glorify it? Because I hid mine for years. I want to be supportive but that’s so hard when she thinks it’s cute. It’s not fucking cute. It’s 6 am &amp; I still haven’t slept because I’m scared to eat.",1578739767,1/11/2020 4:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/en61oj/ever_met_someone_who_glorifies_eating_disorders/,38

Most of the times she comes to practise she is already in her outfit but in december we had a performance and she changed in front of me. I was able to count her ribs and her vertebra (sorry, english is not my first language). I know most ballerinas are quite thin but she does not look healthy. Without makeup she looks very sick. 
We get along very well in class but besides that we don't have a lot to do with each other.
She lives alone and her parents live in another country but her sister lives here too and goes to the same ballet school as we do.

Should I express my concern or ask the sister if her sibling is doing okay? Or would you recommend to stay out of it?

Back in October I decided that I was too fucking fat and had to lose some weight. I hated looking in the mirror. I hated how I looked in all my clothing and I just wanted a flat stomach and a jawline like girls I interact with at school. I have been counting calories for a few months now, it wasn’t that restrictive and I wasn’t totally obsessive about it. It was actually pretty high. Whenever I tried to go lower I couldn’t and felt so ashamed of myself for not being able to. I couldn’t exercise regularly due to an insane schedule, so the weight loss look a fucking long time. Around New Years, I ate too much and felt like throwing up because my stomach was too full. I’ve barely eaten a meal since. My dad is guilting me into eating food but I only eat a few bites and say that I feel nauseous. I really do suffer from extreme nausea when I do restrict heavily and that’s why I didn’t do it so often to begin with. I’ve lost five extra pounds since New Years and it’s making me not want to eat much ever again. I’ve also been battling with a potential respiratory infection and  the flu. I feel so weak, and I feel guilty for not eating, but... it’s working.  And that scares me. My counselor already thinks I have a problem, and he was nice enough to order me lunch yesterday with a school budget thing, and he promised to eat with me during lunch but he was too busy. I ended up eating a few bites and nothing more... he was so generous and so nice and it made me feel so guilty because I really do have people in my life who care about me and don’t want me to suffer and this takes over anyway. I can’t tell my friends because they’d never stop fucking harassing me to eat, and I can’t handle that.

There's no light exercise for me because everything is about burning more calories and i can't stop..
So everything hurts so bad and I can't get up from my couch because I'm exhausted.. I hate my life so much right now.. :(

I just want to vent mostly, but if there's anyone with similar experience out there that has found a way to deal with this, I'd like to hear about it :)",1578590163,1/9/2020 11:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/emcopd/im_so_exhausted/,5

4265,eskzh1,"I’ve recovered, but I still hate eating and it’s not the eating disorder I knew","So, I recovered probably just over three years ago I’d say. I feel like Anorexia is one of those conditions which sort of wait in the wings, but overall I’ve been well for some time. Of course I still get occasionally intrusive thoughts, but now I can overlook them.
Despite this, I am chronically thin and I put it down to my lack of interest in food. I do sometimes feel hunger and when I do, I eat, without guilt, but this is rare. 
Meals can honestly make me feel sick to stomach, sometimes I can’t even swallow without gagging, as if my body is rejecting the food almost. As such I often forget to eat, avoid eating and generally don’t treat food like the fuel it is. 

I’m not sure if there’s a link but it would be interesting to find out. Has anyone been in a state of confident recovery yet developed this poor relationship with food?

I don’t think it should.... idk I desperately want to relapse I’ve been wanting to starve but my boyfriend makes me eat or he threatens not to eat. I have a tendency of judging people’s bodies when I’m in a bad mental place. Well we have both gained weight, so a part of me is like maybe if he did eat less he could lose a few pounds. I know that’s not how it works though and I don’t want him developing this disorder too. I don’t want him to realize how great it feels to starve and crave it like I do. I know people care I just am stressed and have so much on my plate right now, too much to worry about eating something on a physical plate. I just want to have sex, smoke weed and get shit done. I feel like I’m reverting to who I was a few semesters ago. Why does college and stress just make me want to starve? And then wanting to starve makes me lie. Lying and starving leads to me being angry because of the hunger and people not noticing and people being so ignorant and me being stress and people only thinking about what’s going on in there little life never caring about anyone else..

4279,es5nve,I feel so stupid,"I know I shouldn’t but I do. 

Every week, my dietitian alas about racing heart and chest pain. She reminds me of how serious anorexia is and how it can hurt my heart. Last week, I purged for well over an hour. My heart was racing and I was in the shower and had to turn the water to cold. I’m *always* cold so that is saying something. Nearly 50 degrees last couple days. Today I was wearing a sweater and still freezing. Not even underweight atm (it fluctuates between underweight and low end of healthy which of course makes me feel like shit). Anyway, I felt dizzy and thought I might pass out. My dietitian was pretty concerned and said that I could have died at that moment. 

So today when I woke up with my back in pain and then chest pain that came on suddenly and stayed throughout the day, I was worried but scared to go to urgent care because I was afraid it was my heart and they would admit me (I can’t afford to be admitted and take leave. Refer to my post history for a full explanation of this). I’m in a recovery group chat and they convinced me to go. My normal hospital has this ridiculous new system where you can save your spot online for urgent care. So I check and their urgent care has nothing today. So I go to urgent care through another hospital. They do all the normal stuff. My blood pressure is fine. My lungs sound fine and my heart sounds fine. They do an EKG and she said it looks textbook normal. She said it could be anxiety or the beginning of a cold. 

I know I shouldn’t but I feel stupid. I did tell them I have an eating disorder when I got there but they still didn’t seem concerned. I feel like I wasted my time. It makes me feel like I’m completely fine and this isn’t really an issue. Even though I’m always cold, my fingers are blue, and I often feel like I’m going to fall. I do lose my footing a lot just standing. I know I’m sick but somehow this makes me feel like I’m completely fine. I also had my blood and urine checked about a month ago and everything was normal. I feel very much like this is a reason to keep going and “proves” that I shouldn’t eat and don’t deserve food. 

I almost laughed when the doctor asked if I have anything I do to destress. Almost said something to the extent of “I told you guys I have an eating disorder when I came in. You can probably figure out that my coping skills are not healthy” 

I was telling people at work I might not make it in tomorrow. I work at a school as a tutor so I have to do a lot of communication with teachers and I wanted them to be aware if I wasn’t there. Now I feel like everyone is going to be hyper aware of me and be worried about everything I do. People already express concern when they see me not eating and offer me food all the time. I’m afraid people are going to put 2 and 2 together. I don’t want *anyone* to know I have an eating disorder. No one at the school knows and I want to keep it that way. I’d rather just say I have medical issues. 

I hate myself. I hate my brain. I wish I could just stop existing.",1579661354,1/21/2020 20:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/es5nve/i_feel_so_stupid/,0

I’m so fed up with the “you’re too skinny”, “you’re all bones”, “you’re going through something most teenage girls go through”. Like shut the fuck up.

Not eating makes me happy. And it has nothing to do with outer influence. I brought this on myself and only I can fix it!!! So if I don’t want to fix it, which I don’t, let me be!!

I know that my family would be considered toxic if they didn’t worry for me, but I wish that they at least tried to hide their worries for me so that I didn’t feel like I was burdening them all the time.

Fuck this.

I’m too ashamed to admit that YES. YES I DO.

I study every single person that walks by me and if they are overweight, I try to train myself to feel disgusted about it. I’ll say to myself “god you look like that too and she is gross”.   Or I’ll stare at someone who is overweight (when they can’t see me ofcourse) and pick apart their rolls and imagine them on me, all while saying awful shit in my head.  I’ll watch people like amberlynn Reid and call her disgusting and gross in my head to try and repulse myself into fasting.

4353,eq6wm0,No reason to recover.,"Usually people recover for their family, friends n other nice future goals. Well, I don’t have any of that. 

I mean I got family n some friends but have always struggled keeping contact w mates, trust issues, thinking everyone is always leaving me, was taken into custody when I was a kid, thankfully the family was really loving n we still love eachother to this day. Got called fat by my grandma. I’m an emotional mess when it comes to any kind of relationships. Being in an proper relationship like my sisters, don’t even think about it.. [gay male btw]

Have never believed in myself, everyone else does tho n it’s sad how I just keep starving myself, use laxatives every now n then to empty my bowel to stay thin cause I’ve fucked up my digestion so food gets all stuck in there. Can’t go to school cause bad shit happened there as well back in the days. Not even sure what I’d pursue as a career, most likely couldn’t focus to studying due to my past.

I eat for awhile maybe even a week, then start hating my body, take laxatives, starve, cigarettes, caffeine which I try to limit as it fucks up my sleep n makes my anxiety worse. Tho I do like to numb myself by not eating, helps w anxiety.

I look back some old shirtless pics of me n not even sure am I fat or fine in them. Clearly I was fine in most of them, like after I grew up n started eating healthier. Until years go by n u can see how I’m losing muscle n my stomach begins to collect all the food n water weight not able to let it go. When u spend years thinking ur fat, then lose weight n are finally happy how u look. Ya let’s just say gaining back some of that weight is not easy..

I know what u may be thinking. ”U can’t even try to have any of these nice things if u don’t recover.”  but it’s not that simple.

I could probably write more but this is already so long.

4359,eq0yo4,Struggling between getting better and wanting to continue,"So after 15 or so years of a myriad of eating disorder tendencies and denial, I got help. I have been seeing a therapist who specializes in ED for a couple months now. We danced around the issue for multiple sessions and then one day I finally broke down and told her. Told her about how I go through cycles, and different variations of ED. It started with restriction and working out obsessively. Then it turned into bingeing and feeling an enormous amount of guilt and then eating more to pacify those feelings, albeit for very short amounts of time. Then it went into crazy obsessive workout and restriction again, then binging with the introduction of purging. Sometimes these tendencies overlapped. 

The other day she said she would kind of diagnose me as someone who has a little bit of a lot of things, and leaning towards orthorexia (I had to look it up but basically being obsessed with eating ""good"" food). After she said this I kinda felt like, that was such a simple diagnosis for what I feel is so complex. Then I started having thoughts of like, well I'm not at the weight I want and what I have doesn't sound that bad, so maybe I could push it a bit further...

So I'm going to therapy to get better, but another part of me wants to continue (like I want to eat less, work out more, lose weight and get fit). I want to be able to do this healthily, but it seems like every time I try I just go down a spiral of one extreme to the other. Does anyone else struggle with this?

Tldr: want to get better but part of me wants to continue (maybe more extremely) with ED tendencies to get desired results.",1579270892,1/17/2020 8:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/eq0yo4/struggling_between_getting_better_and_wanting_to/,2

4364,epu5y4,"Sometimes, you don't realize you're slipping back until someone points it out","I was on the bus home with my office mate. We've become really good friends. And last night, I was talking to her about my plans on how to change my life. Pointing out all my toxic and unhealthy traits and the good habits I want to develop.

After I finished talking, she told me... That it was nice to hear how determined I was to change for the better. But she also felt like I was being too hard on myself. Then one thing led to another, and she finally called me out. She told me: ""I've noticed you haven't been eating. You've been talking about your plans to take care of yourself but... We've been working over time everyday the past few weeks and I've only ever seen you eat once in a day.""

That kinda caught me off guard. Because looking back, she was right. I haven't been eating. 

I've been choosing not to.

And just like that, I remembered all the times I've been unconsciously telling myself ""I wonder if I can get through the day without eating"" and ""I've forgotten how good it felt to feel hungry.""

And I can't ??? I can't even pinpoint where it all started. I just started losing my appetite. I just started opting to smoke instead of eating. I just started limiting my food intake, and feeling disgusted when I ate too much. I've been buying packs of gum instead of crackers to get me through the day.

When all this was happening, I never thought ""Oh I think I might be relapsing""

So. Idk. I don't really know where I'm going with this. I guess I was just really surprised. 

And now, I also feel bad because I sound like a hypocrite. Because tbh, with the way things are going... I still don't want to eat. How can I expect myself to get better if I refuse to let go this part of my life?

Also... I've been noticing my body getting smaller. My collarbones are starting to show again. My thighs are getting thinner... And I hate that that this is the only thing that's exciting me at the moment.

I don't know. hahaha i don't know what to do with myself anymore. I feel like a complete hypocrite.",1579229111,1/16/2020 20:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/epu5y4/sometimes_you_dont_realize_youre_slipping_back/,2

4376,evzlqs,I guess I can afford treatment,"In some of my previous posts, I talked about not being able to afford treatment because I can’t afford to take leave. I have Medicaid and I think it should be covered. I am a paid volunteer with a nonprofit and it’s different than a normal job. We are considered members and we get a living stipend and other benefits. I had talked to my boss and I misunderstood the leave policy. The way it was explained, I thought that if I took any long term leave, it was unpaid. But that is only if it more than 30 days. I still get my living stipend if I take less than 30 days leave. And I can work a modified schedule when I come back. This makes me feel better but also scared. Because now I can’t say I can’t go to intensive treatment until July. Intensive treatment sounds terrifying and all I can see it as is losing all my freedom. I really want to get better. I’m sick of this and being plagued by this. Honestly, death is preferable to this. When people say this is important because I could die, I just think, “so?” I want to get better and have a family and be a teacher. I want to be happy. I just don’t see any of those things as achievable or even something I deserve. I’m tired of being cold all the time, feeling dizzy, hunger pains, anxiety, etc. I’m tired of purging. I’m tired of feeling like I’m only accomplished if I eat nothing. I wish I could just rid my brain of this monster. But treatment is scary. I don’t want my meals monitored and to be monitored even in the bathroom. I don’t want to be forced to not exercise. I’m already not supposed to be exercising or purging but I can’t stop. I’m scared to let go. I’m terrified of gaining weight. I’m terrified I’ll never stop gaining if I start. I’m terrified to eat normal as weird as that sounds. Does this ever get any easier? How do I get over the fear of recovery and intensive treatment?",1580357984,1/29/2020 22:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/evzlqs/i_guess_i_can_afford_treatment/,0
4377,evze8j,I think I may be anorexic and I don't know what to do,"every meal now is super agonizing - I can't look at a plate of food without trying to count the calories in it, and if it gets above a certain amount I feel disgusting. I live in dorms and eat at cafeterias, and whenever I get up to get more food after I get a plate of something it takes five minutes of struggling back and forth and then I feel like I'm out of control. I hate feeling full, and I don't like the feeling of being hungry very much, but I worry I've overeaten if I don't feel hungry at the end of the day. I'm training up for a half marathon, and I know that it's going to be more difficult if I don't eat, but I eat less on days that I run anyway.

and at the same time, I'm still a semi-healthy weight, even though I'm losing it slowly, so I simultaneously feel like I'm sliding into a disorder and I'm faking it. even when I'm eating less, I still eat three meals a day and I don't fast, so I feel like I'm not really anorexic. but if I am, I don't want to tell anyone because I'm afraid they'll try to make me eat more and gain weight. I know that I shouldn't be this afraid of gaining weight, and I shouldn't hate the fat on my body as much as I do, but trying to eat high-calorie foods makes me sick to my stomach whenever I think about how they may make me go over my calorie allowance. I used to really love food, and I really love making food, but there are so many pictures of food that I see or recipes and I think, I can't make that, it's got this or that fattening ingredient in it.

I just needed to type this out because I feel like it's taking over a bigger and bigger part of my life. I've known that I've had an unhealthy relationship with food for years now, but last year I was able to live normally and gain weight, and since this past summer/fall it's turned around and gotten mentally worse than it was before. I'm worried, but part of me is taking a horrible joy from the fact that I don't want to get better.",1580357009,1/29/2020 22:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/evze8j/i_think_i_may_be_anorexic_and_i_dont_know_what_to/,3

4382,evvc40,A lost father,"My daughter is 14. At 13, we pulled her out of school and spent 5 months in a highly regarded eating disorder program that restored my daughter’s weight. It was too late to restore the 4” of height she would have grown without this, So now she’s 4’11” and that’s that. But when she left, her labs were good again. 

We got her home, and things were ok for awhile. Then she started restricting again. 

Smash cut to - she won and we lost. She now will have to go to 24/7 residential, which will happen in 2-3 weeks - unless she dies before then. 

Anyway, I can’t reach my daughter. She hates me for sending her off. And just because. She thinks she’s fine and that there’s no problem and if I were in her corner I’d let her do whatever she wants. 

Unsure if this is a sub for pro-anorexia or anti-anorexia but either way, maybe I can get some feedback as to why every move I make has been the wrong one.

She was experiencing the realization that once your body adjusts a bit, you really don't feel that hungry a lot of the time (at least I didn't until I was a couple weeks in when it was really bad).

I told her to eat more for all the right reasons, but part of me was telling her to eat so she couldn't realize there was a way to just not eat, and take ""my thing"". I used to be so possessive about it, and resented anyone else who was sick too because I felt like they were taking ""my thing"" away from me, the thing that felt so personal and like part of my identity.

I remember when I was little my big sister was overweight and I never wanted to be like that, Fat disgusted me at an age that I should have been playing games with friends. I loved being skinny, how I looked, all the compliments, they fed my ego and as I got older the ED got much worse. I was mainly anorexic, I wasn’t fond of purging Bc I didn’t want the food inside me at all. I felt like if I purge I fail. My junior year of HS I dated a mentally abusive bf who would call me fat constantly and I spiraled. I was skin and bones, my parents noticed and got me help. It helped me eat a little more but the ED was definitely still there but manageable. In college my weight was up and down depending on my mood. I eventually ended up getting more help and it worked this time, I thought I was finally cured of the constant voices in my head telling me I’m fat. I was good for about 3 years and last month I got super sick with a stomach bug and couldn’t really eat for 10 days and lost a bunch of weight and it triggered the ED. I’ve barely ate all month, I look great though so it’s fueling it more. You know the worst part, I kinda missed my ED. It kept my mind distracted from other problems bC that’s all I could think of, and I love being skinny.

4416,ev5u5s,Helping a friend with anorexia?,"Hi,

My friend has an eating disorder. She has always told me about how she was insecure about her weight, so when she started bringing less and less food to school, I knew that something was wrong. 

She is a very busy person, she is a semi-professional sports person, so she doesn't have a lot of free time. When I bring up seeking treatment, she freaks out and starts telling me that her sport is way more important than her health, and that her and her parents are trying to recover without professional help. I dont know if this is the truth.

I dont want to trigger her, or force her to recover, but it has gotten really bad, and im afraid that something really bad might happen if she doesn't get professional help.

Does anyone have any tips to talk to her about this, or any tips on how to get her treatment?",1580219396,1/28/2020 7:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ev5u5s/helping_a_friend_with_anorexia/,4
4417,ev4lwo,"I have bad anorexia days and good ones, but at the end of them I feel like I haven't done enough to shrink myself","The thing with me is that they got onto my eating disorder very quickly but I was diagnosed with ARFID(look it up, can't be bothered explaining) and it was assumed that other suspicions of me having AN were common misdiagnosis. Fair enough. But I have both and I know it! I'm terrified of eating new foods or foods of a certain texture or foods that will trigger my intolerances but I am also terrified of not losing weight! 
So naturally it fluctuates; cornflakes are a comfort food for me but I feel like it's gonna add to the fat on me, and carrots are a food I know won't make me feel fatter but they make me very anxious because for some reason I don't trust carrots. I dunno why, just my autistic ass decided on what food is devilspawn and what food isn't and I just abide. 
Being that they put me in outpatient eating disorser treatment, my family is constantly monitoring my eating and it means I have to work towards starvation in secret. I also hate to contribute to global food waste so I eat what I'm given, but nothing else. When I am feeling really harrowed by how much I've eaten and how much I miss the emptiness, I over-exercise. I get to school and I try to talk to my mates about having been diagnosed with an ed but I feel like a fool and a self-obsessed hypercondriac because I'm at expected weight.
I have a couple of friends who are really skinny but it's just because of their metabolism. I(or the anorexia) envies being so small. I also have really low self-esteem and I can't bear to have like a medium size body. Like I don't deserve it somehow so I have to shrink myself away. I try to act completely normal like everyone else around my skinny friends but I'm actually overboiling with emotions most of the time. My mind is preoccupied with how much I want to be smaller so I kinda mention the topic of their weight too much, just without realising. 
Living with an eating disorder is so exhausting! Especially when you try to convince others that you're in need of help and that you're not recovering, just surviving. I swear I can't bear to read the scales and see I'm at a healthy weight ever again. I want back what I had pre-diagnosis, an alarmingly low weight and sweet, blissful, control.",1580212313,1/28/2020 5:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ev4lwo/i_have_bad_anorexia_days_and_good_ones_but_at_the/,0

I'm super super triggered by the fact that I've never been hospitalized for anorexia. I'm HORRIFIED of going to an inpatient clinic and absolutely dont want to, but the fact that I've never been ""bad"" enough to be forcibly hospitalized makes me feel like I never got thin even at my lowest weight. it's a weird feeling because I really dont want to go to a hospital but I also think I'll never believe I'm thin til I'm in one. I know I'll still feel fat in a hospital because that's how anorexia works but I still just....want to I dont know. it's probably because I used to watch clinic documentaries to trigger myself when I was actively starving (I've been forced to physically recover so I'm not nearly as bad as I was/want to be) so that's just like.....warped into my goal. ugh. I dont know what to do with this feeling. 

I also have a fear of going to a hospital because I'm scared that I'll be the fattest one there, especially right now because of how much I'm being forced to eat. like my mental state absolutely should be in a clinic but I'm so fat I'd be humiliated around everyone else who would be so much thinner.

I used to be super underweight but basically went to rehab for it and eventually gained all the weight back and then some. I have been going to the gym regularly for the past two months and doing my best to eat healthy so I'm really strong but none of it is showing on the outside. The muscle weighs so much more than I look and so my BMI basically says I'm obese even though I know I'm not but it's so hard to look at that number and then look in the mirror. The only thing stopping me from just cutting off all food is the fact that I'm in college right now and my brain just doesn't work when I'm hungry and by the time I get to that point where I stop being hungry the damage to my grades will probably already be done.

If only they know the struggle. i see a lot of them venting on their social accounts when someone tells them “you’re fat” etc. (body shaming) but it seems to me that people only have one idea that body shaming is conceptualized to being overweight and not underweight. 

fast forward to now, i’m in my 2nd year in grad school. I entered into a relationship where I am loved and accepted though I was unusually underweight. one day I just suddenly realized when I saw myself in the mirror that damn I gained weight. when I weighed myself I was normal. not saying you should enter a relationship.

What if I get used to eating more than I am supposed to be eating?What if what if what if?

He was really nice. He, himself, has a really low BMI. When we first got together a year ago, I felt nervous about how skinny he was comparatively. I've since lost 10lbs. He's always been SO CAREFUL about talking with me about body issues. But he said that if I gained weight I would look healthy and it would ""add curves to my curves"", and ""healthy looks sexy""

I'm still trying to decide if this has had a positive effect on me or not. I guess it will be determined.

Anyone else have this kind of feedback where it's in-between?

\-In one way it made me feel this dark happiness ""sick skinny""? Excellent Smithers.  
\-In another way, I felt total relief. I can gain some weight and be OK.

4444,eup7iz,Men with eating disorders?,"I've been suffering from anorexia on and off for the past 7 years (I'm 19). 

The last ED wave was this summer; I was heavily restricting. After not having eaten anything for a week I was eventually hospitalized for what they chose to call a ""suicide attempt"" because men aren't supposed to be anorexic. They didn't help me at all and I was paired with a doctor who broke doctor-patient confidentiality. It was overall not a salubrious experience.

I decided to take matters into my own hands as I understood that I wouldn't get any help from my healthcare providers. I recovered, but recently I've fallen back, and now I'm back at square one. I'm restricting to the extreme and I want to become healthy again- I just don't know how. I've told my psychologist, and she will be informing my psychiatrist and counselor, but I'm afraid it won't help; it never has, so far.

I feel so alone in this, especially since I'm a guy. I try to seek out similar stories and such online since that's supposed to help with the loneliness, but I dont really feel ""seen"". I don't find texts about how I'm a ""beautiful, strong, woman who's valuable, no matter her size"" very applicable to my situation.

They love naked skinny women online, exs, friends .. but they don’t look at your like they do these people and that’s where it starts. The pain becomes depression, which later when you learn to hate your self so much you start to want to be like these people. This is what beautiful is right? A skinny girl, big tits who acts as a slut online. That’s beautiful now a days. So you change the one thing that is hard to change. You start to count calories and you loose pounds.. they still don’t notice you. You know of your depression and self harm and they don’t care. Your The mother of their child, and they don’t seem to care . They still throw insults at you and some days, you just feel like you can’t hold you head up over the water in the storm. And so in that moment, you give up. But not like a normal giving up. You give up happiness and the hope you have to force your self to keep counting, because if I loose so so amount I’ll be beautiful and I can be happy then and then I can be loved... but the catch is...


No matter how skinny you look, how slutty you are...




They will never love you



And it’s not your fault. You’ve always been beautiful. You’ve always been perfect. They were just a virus trying to break in and change your rna.. they were a bacteria wanting to use your body until you were sick. 

It was never you. It was them. 

You deserved love, they did not. They didn’t appreciate you when you deserved the world.

I went to therapy two years ago when my fat ass got really thin again but I stopped going about a year ago because I was restricting again and I felt like my therapist was annoying. I got better afterwards on my own but right now I am restricting again. I didn't start for any particular reason but that I had gained way too much weight in the past few month after I broke up with my boyfriend and started going to university. I wanted to loose weight but instead of just trying to eat less sweets I started counting my calories again.

4469,etyuw2,Has anyone who is active in their anorexia had to take the Plan B pill?,"Last night this guy Ive been seeing for about 2 and a half weeks or 3 weeks and I had sex for the first time—we had been drinking and he wasn’t wearing a condom. The whole thing was really stupid. On both our parts. He didn’t know I wasn’t on birth control that is totally on me. But he didn’t put on a condom or ask if I was on bc. I assumed he’d pull out and all my ex boyfriends have done that and it’s been fine, I was also drunk and NOT thinking clearly. This guy just kind of abruptly stopped. I thought he was tired and just couldn’t go on. He didn’t make any of the usual noises, or motions of anything that he was about to orgasm. When he abruptly stopped I said “are you ok? I can try another way to make you get there” and he said “I just did” I was in total TOTAL shock because he absolutely didn’t seem like he did, I had no idea and then realized wow WTF you just did that with no condom, no warning, no pulling out , nothing. And he seemed totally unbothered by it. So I got really upset and worried and silent for about 5 mins then said “well I’m worried because I’m not on birth control and you weren’t wearing a condom” he didn’t seem phased in the slightest, was totally relaxed and said “that’s ok, you can get the plan b pill tomorrow. Or I’ll get it for you” 


Yeah, well, he doesn’t understand that i don’t take birth control so I haven’t had extra or different hormones in me in FOREVER. Especially a high amount. The one and only time I took the plan B pill it was like 12 years ago because my boyfriends condom broke. It made me break out with pimples really badly, that’s one thing. It also made me super nauseous, super crampy and made me bleed a lot for about a week. What I don’t remember is if it made me gain any kind of weight anywhere because I wasn’t anorexic 12 years ago and didn’t think about stuff like that. 

But now I obsess over it obviously. So has anyone who is actively anorexic and deeply concerned about their weight taken the Plan B? And how did you react? I think knowing or hearing from people with the same concerns might lessen my anxiety. Because I’m scared it will make me super hungry, make my boobs bigger, cause a ton of water retention, possibly slow down my metabolism, make me break out with acne and make my periods irregular when right now they’re SUPER regular and I hate to have to mess with that. I’m still going to take it but my anxiety is through the roof.",1579996515,1/25/2020 17:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/etyuw2/has_anyone_who_is_active_in_their_anorexia_had_to/,6
4470,etwypd,Battling Anorexia And Bulimia," 

It started when I was 14. I had always been conscious of the way I looked but this, this was different. I started small, just eating a little bit less and working out more. I knew all about eating disorders. we had studied them in school. I never thought I would be that girl, the girl with the eating disorder. it all seemed so far away, so unrealistic.


The small steps I took grew bigger. I started restricting, hiding food, and spent all my time fixated, concentrated, on my weight, my next meal, how much exercise I needed to do. I grew thinner, and I developed bruises on my back from all the sit ups I was doing in a desperate, vain attempt to try and lose the weight that I hated so much. It got to the point where I would stand in front of the mirror, naked, and look at all my flaws. From my eyes, there was nothing good about myself. I only felt good, only felt ok about myself, when I was hungry.


Eating brought shame and guilt, and visits to the bathroom where I could cry from my self-loathing, and consider all my options. I became obsessive over the amount of food I ate, and the number of calories I burnt.


The voices inside my head whispered to me incessantly, telling me that it wasn't enough, no matter what I did.


I became concentrated on losing more and more weight, and it was never enough. I was underweight, faint and dizzy, fatigued, but I could not see these symptoms.


When I finally noticed that something was wrong, I was running, and suddenly, I could barely stand. I fell to the floor and did not move for maybe ten minutes, gathering my strength. I walked the rest of the way home and since then, have begun to get help for my condition, more commonly known as anorexia. Relapses are a still a regular occurrence for me.


But, this is my fight, and I won't give up. I know that there are many others out there, who fight their own demons on a regular basis, and it is no different for me. Know that you are f***ing strong for getting this far, and please don't give up hope.


Fighting your demons and fighting your own mind is one of the hardest things that anyone can do, but this is your fight. Don't give up.

I’v been looking into treatment centers as well as my therapist recommended some but a lot of them have bad reviews so I’d like to know of some good ones and the experience anyone has had. It would also be nice if they weren’t as strict on rules as some centers.

4536,eym763,"Boyfriend of a girl with Anorexia, with questions about her developing bulimic habits.","I'm a boyfriend to a girl with Anorexia, and we've been developing strategies to help her recover. I'm sort of her only support system, as therapist is too expensive and her mom seems to have lost all hope.

My first strategy that actually worked for a while was just asking her once in a while ""what did ya have for lunch?"" or ""did ya have three good meals?"" 

This seemed to work, and she hit a record weight, the only problem being she weighed herself, which I know isn't a helpful solution I think.
 
Ever since she weighed herself she dropped again because she developed bulimic habits. She black out after she eats and isn't able to remember or control her purging. She also has anxiety attacks if she doesn't purge. I know this isn't the Bulimia sub, but you guy are really helpful and responsive.

I suggested starting a voice memo before she eats to keep track of the times she purged, and to start recognizing the signs, and also to try and have her meals with other people around. This is new to me, Bulimia, it's a whole new realm that I'm not familiar with so I'm really feeling around for some solutions.

My main questions: are there any flaws in our strategies here, anything I can do more to help with her? Anything thats more problematic than helpful?

I just want to see her healthy and happy and I'm willing to fight this with her every step by any means necessary, so if you have any suggestions I would be so so so grateful.

I've got a very good friend, who is anorexic and since we opened up about our problems to each other, we supported each other in difficult moments.
It isn't easy for her and I was proud of every meal she ate. It was seeming like it was getting better and better each and every day. Of cause she had days with relapses, but they got rarer than before.


Now:
Today we chatted again and after a time talking she told me, she wasn't well at all. After eating lunch with some friends she was angry about her self afterwards, that she was eating at all.

She told me she doesn't want to even try continuing with eating or getting back to a normal eating behavior.
Weeks, even days back she was much more motivated to eat and get better and healthier, but it all went away so quickly...


She doesn't have a therapist, because her parents won't allow her to have one. She doesn't want to go to a clinic, even though this plan would work from the parental side, but it is understandibly scary for her to attend to one.

Her parents aren't very helpful, because they only force her to eat rather then helping her more effectively.

The main problem is that we don't live in the same country. In terms of helping its mostly through texting and skypecalls. I've read up plenty on the disorder itself and recovery processes. I know there isn't any actual solution, but to the recoverees amongst (I'm very proud of you all, you've done amazingly ❤️), what are some things people have done to help you that had a positive effect on you?

I bought some food today which i will finish but that’s about it. Would b huge waste of money to not eat them. I honestly don’t know anymore. Spiraling into deeb depression where life seems so pointless. What’s the point? What’s there left? Literally _nothing_.

I was very underweight last winter but got back to a healthy weight because of how close I was with my mom and hated seeing her cry (we were like best friends) as well as having to already put off so many semesters of school. Since then I still haven’t been able to do another semester my mom doesn’t understand any of my mental illnesses and after going to some therapy it made me realize how much I blame my mom from not protecting me and my brother from my dad or even making things worse as well as she doesn’t support my anorexia or mental heath like she should she tries but at this point our relationship has just gotten bad. I moved out in the summer and cut my dad out of my life. My mom has been helping me financially. Since the summer my relationship has just been getting worse and worse with her. I told her more then once and even texted her exactly how I feel and felt about what she’s done or does but she doesn’t get it. I used to have so many friends too especially from college but my anorexia and everything else has scared them away so I’m at the point where I have no support system other then my therapists which haven’t helped (need to find new ones) I just feel like I have nothing to live for anymore I missed so many semesters of school don’t have my mom anymore to talk to which I would tell her everything and no friends. I’ve dealt with so much and keep going on but nothing gets better. I don’t even see myself having a future at this point when in least in the beginning of my my last relapse I did I still had dreams and goals. Don’t care about those or anything anymore at this point Idk what to do my depression is so bad and I just break down and have no one to turn to I feel alone and to be honest I don’t care if my anorexia kills me this time I’ve struggled with everything not just anorexia I can never catch a break for to long not even on the right meds right now just found another new psychiatrist after about 100. Idk what to do anymore I just wish I had something or someone to live for.. Sorry for the huge rant.

4639,ew2sqw,relapse limbo,"i developed anorexia at 15. 16-17 i spent doing several inpatient/outpatient programs. when i was 17 i got out of the hospital one day and decided i would leave treatment and try recovering on my own.
i ended up doing p good. since i was 17 i started eating by my choice, my way. i stopped exercising except walking, i started eating what i pleased when i pleased. i didn’t check my weight once. 
i am now almost 19. i started getting ed thoughts when somebody posted thinspo on tumblr and spent that entire night looking through proana tags. 
ever since i left treatment, ive avoided doctors at all costs but recently had to see my (new) doctor, so for a prescription. i went, they weighed me, the number was way higher than i thought it would be and i threw a total fit. 
i wrote all this meanspo about myself when i got home and decided to lose a bit. i quickly got invested in looking at thinspo/diets/workouts/calories and didn’t eat for the rest of the day.
im extremely confused about what to do. it feels so good to be hungry and i cannot live w myself at this weight i really can’t. my body is actually healthy now and i worked so hard for it but i cannot live knowing it’s this high. i just don’t know how easily it would become a full blown disorder again.
i can’t talk to anybody about this - my family would want me to go back to treatment in an instant, as would my therapist. i don’t have any close friends really and my boyfriend doesn’t know about the hospitals or anything.

ive heard a lot of overweight-obese people diagnose themselves with anorexia because they compensate for binges or restrict to the degree a dieter would tend to do for their health out of guilt instead of care for their own well being. this is very disordered and their weight has no impact on whether or not they have a problem or deserve help for it, i completely think they should seek treatment because all forms of disordered eating are destructive and will take so so much joy from your life. 

i honestly should not care whether someone is claiming to have something they dont fit the criteria for and refuse to see a doctor about because it doesnt actually affect me in any way, but it makes me feel so disgusting. it feels like a bit of a slap in the face when people act like simply eating less and going under your tdee for a couple days will start killing you. idk why i really get so hung up on this because i know its not healthy to have any kind of disordered behavior but it just makes me feel icky that anorexia is thrown around so lightly like it wont given enough time take over your entire life and consume your personality and *actually* kill you and people are just saying oh my anorexia isnt even making me lose weight.",1581479961,2/11/2020 21:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f2l4fx/improper_self_diagnosis/,6

4661,f2g85m,Anorexia + Addiction = please say I’m not alone in this...,"Hey, I actually just wanted to know if I’m all alone in this, I have Anorexia Nervosa, going a bit on and off from B/P subtype to restricting subtype. But I’ve also recently (in May 2019) started to misuse my Morphine, it started with just taking more than I should, then I started using IV a bit and now I’m all in an IV addict. I’m going on a program to stop, I’ve cut down to less than a fourth of what I was taking regularly when I was at my worst. 

Using made me B/P less, when i was using I could also eat and my ED got so much “better” during the time I used the most. But the thing is, I suffer from Anorexia, Anxiety, Addiction but also because of my Anxiety I have a problem with self harm. 

I feel extremely alone in this. 

As I’ve started to use less, I get more and more urges to self harm or B/P to deal with the withdrawal. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. 

It’s either harming myself physically, trough food or misuse of my Morphine.

I get professional help to “step out” the Morphine and I go to the Psychiatric ER to se a Psychiatrist twice a week and I go to get my daily dose of morphine daily. Every time I go see the Psychiatrist I also leave a urine sample so that they can be reassured that I do not use anything else or too much etc.

I don’t know what’s going to happen on Monday when I start on my new lower dose, every time I lower my dose, which is weekly, the urges to replace the drugs with something else gets stronger and stronger. When I harm myself I do risk my life and that scares me, haven’t harmed myself since December when I ended up in the intensive care unit, had to undergo surgery etc.

Don’t know how to deal with this anymore, has anyone else gone trough or is going through something like this? I feel so goddamn alone in this and don’t know how to deal with it anymore. The psychiatrist just says I should go to the P-AE if it “gets too much”, I feel like I don’t get taken seriously. I don’t feel like I’ll get help if I actually seek help when I reach my crisis points. 

The addiction made me start eating a little bit without the overwhelming anxiety, it was the only thing that stopped the B/P and heavy restricting. I didn’t gain or loose anything which probably helped with the anxiety, I really thought I was going to get clean from the horrible ED. But I was so wrong, the less I’ve been using, the more my ED, anxiety and destructive behaviors come back. 
I’m so scared that the ED will totally take over my life again, it probably will, and I don’t know how I would handle that...

I just can’t stand feeling so alone in this anymore. Please let me know if I’m not.

Because it feels like I’ll never get trough this alive, especially not if I’m alone.

Sorry this became such a long post, hope no one got triggered, I really tried to make the post as non-triggering as I could. I hope it’ll pass the admins too because I can’t stand the feeling of being all alone in this. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you so much, I really needed to vent, even if you’re not going trough what I am now, I could only imagine how tough your journey have been since you’re on this subreddit and you’re reading this... 
I hope you get well or at least better, you deserve all good in life, you deserve all help you can get, even if the ED, anxiety, depression or whatever you’re going trough is telling you that you’re not.",1581459627,2/11/2020 16:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f2g85m/anorexia_addiction_please_say_im_not_alone_in_this/,23

4673,f23eyk,My raw thoughts on my struggle with anorexia+misophonia,"sometimes i feel like im making it all up in my head, like i want attention from it. and then sometimes i see (my weight) on the scale and think “that’s too much.” and i look in the mirror at this one spot on my body that looks so fucking fat all the time- this one part that sticks out more than the rest on my stomach right below my belly button thats why i dont let anyone touch my stomach because i dont want them to feel it and that i just want to cut it off and have that perfect hourglass shape when i only eat an apple a day. i know im not fat. i know that (my weight) is not enough, but i think ive trained myself these past few months to feel horrible after eating a huge meal that i wont eat the next 3 meals after it. big dinner? (big as in half a bowl of pasta that gives me cramps because im not used to eating that much) im only eating a banana the next day. some days i wake up and i LOVE how my body looks, so i dont put anything into it that will change that glorified, thin image of myself. i used to get so much praise for it “you’re so skinny omg im jealous!” “how are you so skinny its unfair” “skinny minnyyy!!” and that makes me feel really good cuz i know its what people, and myself, like to see. i miss my butt and my strong legs and the ability to exercise without fainting, but every time i binge, it backfires and i feel even worse than before because i know that if i eat it wont go to my butt or my legs to make me stronger, its just going to that one spot that my eyes seem to focus on every damn time and i hate it. i hate that spot because it makes me not want to eat and i hate that when i dont eat, i love how i look.

my mom and dad started to notice (after telling my mom a few months ago) when i would make food and have this amazing plate in front of me that took an hour to cook but then it just sits there and i distract myself so the hunger goes away and then i wont have to think about food. “from the side it looks like theres nothing even there” “you’re skin and bones little love! we gotta fatten you up!”I FUCKING HATE THAT!!!!!!!!!! dont say “good girl” mockingly when i finish my plate of food because it makes it seem like im a fucking dog. and the words “fatten you up” make me want to never touch food ever again i HATE IT.

i dont think any of my friends really know the full extent of whats going on because i talk about food and eat enough around them that why would they think somethings wrong? they dont see me at home when im laying in bed so fucking hungry, but i go downstairs to get a glass of milk because thats a good substitute for dinner right? they dont see when i fainted in the pub after not eating all day and now have a scar on my face that reminds me every day of it they dont see me when i go to the fridge because im hungry but then think about what that will do to my body so i distract myself, give up, and close it.

but i cant change it.

i dont know how to without feeling the middle section between fat and thin that makes me look and feel so gross. for all my life ive sucked in my stomach, when it started from me just wanting to look skinny, to my muscle memory of never fulling letting my stomach out

i know its said that people with anorexia wear baggy clothes so people dont see whats underneath, which in some cases is true because i rlly only wear sweatpants and sweatshirts. but its the skin tight tank tops underneath that make me feel really confident. when i wear skinny clothes i get compliments and that fuels my need to stop eating and to maintaining looking skinny because if i ever gain weight people will notice and i dont want anyone to think im fat. ive been the skinny, athletic girl all my life so i ate everything but when athletics were taken out of the picture, i had to do something to maintaining the skinny, so food became less of a priority. im too lazy to run so i use my lazy attribute to not eat.

i think my misophonia is also a wayfor me to avoid eating. i dont like the sound of others eating so i dont eat with them i dont like the sound of my own chewing so i dont eat myself. being skinny is better than having a panic attack because of mouth noises right? even the fucking sight of someone eating makes me want to leave the room and i always feel like im being a bitch that “just doesnt like the sound of chewing” BUT I CANT STAND IT I CANT BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS MY LOVED ONES WITHOUT WANTING TO DIE FROM FRUSTRATION AND IRRITATION BECAUSE OF THIS DISORDER THAT I DIDNT ASK FOR.

i want to be normal again and eat but i dont know how. some days are good and some days are bad and today was a good day because i ate one meal

what does that say about my perception of myself?",1581396964,2/10/2020 22:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f23eyk/my_raw_thoughts_on_my_struggle_with/,2

4699,f1k1uy,When is it bad enough to need help?,"I’ve struggled with eating for years, at first eating only one meal a day in high school for a while because my anxiety made me so nauseous. Then it became me just being super busy and neglecting to eat, not fully on purpose but also I was okay with it. Over the summer of 2019 I didn’t eat a ton, skipping meals or eating very little when I did. A friend noticed and started checking in with me to make sure I was eating three good meals a day. We did this for two months, before I felt capable to continue on my own. However, I’m a college student, and soon afterwards since no one was around to check, I began neglecting to eat again. This time it was a combo of somewhat on purpose and me just being too anxious to eat. Late last fall I started a medication for anxiety that gave me my appetite back. But, these last two months because of that, I’ve started purposefully restricting my food intake. 

In my eyes, I need to lose weight, but I don’t qualify as having an eating disorder because it’s not that bad and I’m still technically eating. I’m not rapidly losing weight, although I am a bit underweight. I don’t feel as if it’s disordered eating or a disorder because I don’t see any physical effects of it yet and because I think I’m okay and that it’s not hurting me. Everyone who has told me otherwise thinks it’s a big deal, and I hate hearing that. But part of me thinks it might be true. I know obviously you can’t tell me if I have an eating disorder or not, but I figured this community would be capable of possibly advising if it’s time to seek help or not. I don’t want to ask for help because I feel I don’t deserve it and that it isn’t that bad yet.",1581304014,2/9/2020 21:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f1k1uy/when_is_it_bad_enough_to_need_help/,6

From now on, guilt tripping after being told not to do so is just going to extend whatever sentence you've been given for breaking rules that are clearly stated. I'm tired of it, and I'm sure others are too. 

Thank you for those that spend time writing thoughtful, helpful messages and tell others when they're breaking rules, and especially to those that report for rule 10 - the rule that people apparently hate.

4733,f10dqh,Becoming addicted to exercise/purging???,"General TW for ED stuff 


I've had an eating disorder going on 3 years now. It was very bad last year. 
I got better over the summer, then returning to uni everything went downhill. My weights been up and down, I was in a binge restrict cycle. 
Long story short, the past few weeks, I've found myself going to the gym here and there. Mostly after a binge, or when I was feeling anxious. My use of laxatives, which was never a thing, has increased ( although i dont think it's really bad, just after binges), twice in the past week ( but I dont really intend on using them frequently!) And I've purged a few times over the last couple of weeks ( again, not that bad, infrequent). 
However, I've gone to the gym every day this week. I've found myself stressed out planning when to go, fitting it in between my classes. We had a snow day yesterday, gym was closed and I freaked out. I went today, for my usual time (just 45 min) came home, and have been obsessing about going back to the gym tomorrow. I even had to do some home workout stuff to relieve this weird anxiety over ""not doing enough"". I binged yesterday (got drunk for the first time in ages), and I'm just terrified right now. Because I'm nowhere near how bad I was last year. But this absolute panic over exercise is scaring me a little bit. Today I went to get pre workout, cause I'm tired all the time. My session was really good, but then I found out that my pre workout has some mineral whatever that supposedly causes water retention and I PANICKED. 
I dont knos what this post was for, except that I'm afraid. But it also isnt that bad, because I'm not bad as I was? So everything is fine? But it's really, really not and it's only been two weeks and I honestly have no idea how to stop this exercise. I feel the need to increase, at least on weekends, because ""I have the time for it, so i should be at the gym"" 
I'm going home for 3 days this upcoming weekend, and I'm literally already panicking over the idea of not being able to go to the gym for 3 days. 
Coupled with heavy restriction, but that's a given, it's like this is my new focus. I just dont know what to do. M dietican obviously told me to cut this shit out, but I cant. And I'm only realizing it now.i thought I was choosing to go to the gym. It's only when it was closed yesterday that I realized I'm not the one controlling this. 
And I'm terrified of gaining weight by muscle or whatever. I'm just so afraid that I'm slowing everything down but I'm still compelled to go to the gym. It's insane. 
I fucking hate having an eating disorder.

4762,f04p6p,I am going into treatment.,"The last thing I wanted was for it to get to this point. I am so disappointed in myself and how much I have allowed anorexia to take from me. I know that I need to do this, for me. I need to do this before anorexia takes the last thing it can from me-my life. 

Although, I essentially made this decision after anorexia took my beloved boyfriend from me the other day. He feels helpless, because he has tried to do everything he can to help with no success. He said he did not truly want to break up because he loves the connection we have, but breaks don’t work-and he needs time away from me and this, as his inability o help has began to affect his self-esteem. I also ended up in the hospital the other day for a somewhat related issue. It was caused by my shame of how much I have let my ED affect my life. It was a long, terrible day in the ER. 

I am heartbroken and ashamed that I affected someone I love so dearly this immensely. He has cared so much. He was going to make a decision (whether or not he is breaking up with me) and talk to me later this week, but I think I made it for him. I told him that I am doing what is best for the both of us (checking myself into treatment) for he needs time to himself, and I need to get better. That if it is meant to be, we will reconnect when I get out. That I hope this isn’t goodbye, and I love him. 

He responded, “I love you too and I hope this isn’t goodbye either” 

So I am not sure where we stand right now. I am not sure if we are broken up, or if he will want to resume things when I get out. I have no idea. I wrote him a letter, and decided that I wanted to wait a little to send it, as I think he just needs time right now even though his response seemed positive. I was originally supposed to go tomorrow, but due to insurance complications it may not be until the end of next week. I am scared, but I also know I am not legally obligated and the length of my stay is up to me, which makes me feel a lot more comfortable. Although the doctor did tell me today that since my eating disorder is so severe, if I don’t respond to treatment in the first 30 days that they would have to transfer me to a hospital.

*edit* I feel like this is an appropriate time to mention this, although most of us here already know. 

You never know when somebody is suffering from an eating disorder, no matter what size. I am a healthy weight, and if I wasn’t going into treatment/made the decision to get better, I could be dead in two months. Always remember never to judge a book by its cover and to be compassionate and kind to whoever you meet ❤️


*update* 

I ended up not going to treatment as I am in a terrible financial situation and had to find a job as soon as possible and start working so I could pay rent. 

I am overjoyed to say that I ended up initiating recovery on my own and have now been in recovery for a month and a half. 

I feel like an actual person again. I can do all the things I used to love doing. I can take walks in the park without blacking out, read, and write poetry that actually makes sense. I can finally think again. My sense of humor has come back, something that has played a huge role in my friendships and social interactions. 

I also got a job, and hopefully will get a second job I just interviewed for. My ex boyfriend and I, the one mentioned above (we did end up officially breaking up), have been spending time together and rebuilding our friendship. Turns out I was right, all he wanted was for me to get better. We are kinda “seeing” each other again. Now that I am myself again, he looks at me the way he did when we first got together. It’s so beautiful. 

I eventually gave him the letter, and he just told me a few days ago that it was the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to him. 

Recovery has been so worth it. I may not look the way I want to anymore, but I can breathe. I can laugh. 

I can finally *live*.",1581047040,2/6/2020 21:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f04p6p/i_am_going_into_treatment/,11

4769,ezx1g3,I’ve only been restricting for a couple days yet it’s already becoming an addiction.,"Hi! My name is Connor and I’m an 18 year old trans man and for most of my life I’ve never had problems with my body image other than my pretty intense gender dysphoria. Actually most of my life I’ve been pretty small and skinny cuz I was born 2 and a half months premature and had problems with appetite as a kid. This all changed a couple days ago when I was looking up some info about anorexia on youtube and tumblr cuz I have friends who have it who I wanna support and also out of genuine curiosity. I looked at some proana stuff on tumblr (I’m very not proana I was just curious) and started to feel bad about my body like that for the first time really ever, and then I had the thought “if I was skinnier I would have less curves and a flatter chest” and I had a bit of a crisis. And then I started to get “what I eat when restricting” videos in my recommendations on YouTube and I kept watching them. The next day I started tracking calories and trying to have as little as possible. And I’m just kinda hooked. The day after that I tried not to think about it and ate whatever and today (the day after that) I started writing down calories and even set a goal and the idea of not doing that is making me feel guilty. I have an addictive personality so I’m not too surprised but it consumed my thoughts a lot quicker than I thought it would.

Update: I told my boyfriend who has dealt with anorexia about this and I realized how hungry I was and I’m saying fuck this and eating as much as I want today.",1581015582,2/6/2020 12:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ezx1g3/ive_only_been_restricting_for_a_couple_days_yet/,4

4794,f6c98b,my ~story~,"first of all, i am living proof that men can suffer from eating disorders. 

i have always struggled with my weight. when i was in elementary/middle school i was overweight. in the beginning of high school i started to lose weight pretty naturally and healthily and it got me down to a pretty normal weight for someone of my height. 

my ed didn’t really start until i met my ex though. he was a lot skinnier than me and it made me really self conscious. so i started restricting. and then i went down the shore with him for mdw last year and i met his cousin, who at the time had just started treatment for her anorexia. she was severely underweight. and as fucked up as it sounds, seeing her inspired me in a way. it was like, “i could be that thin”. and so i just stopped eating. i ate occasionally, but it was always small portions and usually a liquid of some sort. i got severely underweight towards the end of the relationship. and then i went to an outpatient program (for other reasons) and the doctor took me off my adhd medication. 

after that i started gaining a lot of my weight back. and i think i was just too depressed and too hungry from all the time spent not eating that i couldn’t stop myself from eating. 

but within the last couple months i saw my weight starting to get a lot higher than i wanted it to be and started restricting again. and recently i’ve been eating less and less. 

it’s so hard for me (and i assume others as well) because unlike certain psychiatric disorders like depression, you’re not always sure if you want to “recover” from your eating disorder. i don’t know if i should seek treatment for it or let it happen. because deep down i want to be thin, and i know seeking treatment would prevent that. 

i’m just so conflicted and i don’t know what to do.",1582126196,2/19/2020 9:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f6c98b/my_story/,2

4806,f61pae,There is no possible way to lie about our progress in early recovery,"I view much of this illness as an addiction. What sucks is unlike some other addictions (let’s say...porn addiction) and *alike* drug addiction, people can tell when you’ve been restricting within a matter of days, just as people who have been using again. They can tell even without you losing weight-the sunken face. The bags under your eyes. The slow movements. The slurred and quiet speech. The paleness. You can try and use all the makeup you want to cover up those dark circles...doesn’t work. Never worked for me. Well I can’t afford expensive makeup, lol. I can go only 24-48 without eating and I already look and seem dead again. All it takes is a few days of consistently eating and you can always see the color coming back to my face. 

I think you probably have to be recovered for a long time in order for the effects to not be so prominent within a matter of days. It’s not like you can say, “I haven’t watched porn in a few days” and have people believe you because there is no evidence that they’re lying (unless you have access to their technology). 

You just can’t lie to people. I mean, you can, but if they know you well it’s difficult. They’ll probably know. 

**sorry for all the grammatical errors, it was just a rant. It’s not that I *want* to lie to people, I don’t anymore. Kinda saying this in a positive manner actually...it’s a good motivator to keep pushing through. I can’t hurt anyone anymore.

I'm eating proper meals for the most part and with some strict parenting and routine I'm no longer skipping meals. But my anxiety around scales, at this point is getting kinda ridiculous.

I know I've put on weight, I can't use numbers because of the sub but I can *feel* my weight and I'm really proud of that. But I really want to weigh myself but can't work up the courage. My nan owns a scale as well so it's not difficult to get access it's just...I dunno. I feel like I'll feel like I'm making 0 progress if it's lower than I think or I'll scare myself right back into Ana if it's too high..

Obviously it isn't important to my life and I feel somebody will immediately mention that fact so I'm just gonna save your time. It's principle, in my eyes properly weighing myself after 2 years is the final mark to say I've healed but I just have no clue how I can confront my fears.",1582054068,2/18/2020 13:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f5x7fq/overcoming_my_fear_of_scales_possible_trigger/,2

4821,f5nsot,Is anorexia a mindset or a practice,"Hi, I have a question.

I feel like I might have an eating disorder.

But the catch is I eat.

I eat dinner every night, I have to because my mum likes the whole daily family sit-down kind of deal.

I will eat at social events or if I'm out with friends.

I'll eat a bit on my breaks at work because I'm expected to.

But when I'm left on my own I won't. It won't even cross my mind. I don't get hungry. 

I eat one meal a day and that's dinner because my mum isn't awake in the mornings and nobody forces me to eat lunch at school.

I like to pass it off as the appetite reduction that comes from my ADHD meds or the fact that I'm simply too busy to remember to eat but then there are the times I stand in front of the mirror and feel so proud that I havent eaten all day.

Or feeling hungry and consciously choosing to have half a piece of chewing gum or a glass of water instead because I eat too much.

Or the way I run everywhere I can and it's not because I'm in a rush, it's because I only spent 2 hours on the treadmill that day and my muscles aren't burning enough for it to be adequate. 

Basically, I eat every single day and I'm wondering if it's possible at all for me to have an eating disorder. 

This sort of mindset has been an on and off thing for around three years, but it's getting worse as I get closer to moving out. Since August I've lost a substantial amount of weight (dont want to put the numbers, but it's not a healthy amount). I don't know if that changes anything.

I'm just confused. Thank you in advance for any and all help, I don't know if this is a stupid question or not yet. 

I'm not asking you to diagnose me or anything either, you guys arent professionals and I wouldnt ask you to do anything of that sort. I'm just asking more along the lines of is it a possibility or am I overthinking, you know?",1582009203,2/18/2020 1:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f5nsot/is_anorexia_a_mindset_or_a_practice/,5

4859,f4pv18,I've lost Control. Please help me.,"I had a binge eating disorder. It was horrible and sickly. I hated myself. I hated my fat. I couldn't control myself. I decided for change. 

So I started seeing early signs of Ana about a year ago but things got extremely serious towards summer and I'd dropped really underweight. It felt so addicting to see the number on the scale get lower everyday, feel the water fill you on an empty stomach- and what was previously an innocent plan to lose weight and get into shape morphed into a full blown eating disorder.

I have an anxiety disorder (where I always feel completely uncontrolled of myself) and choosing not to eat gave me that control in which I became addicted to.

After summer and at my lowest weight, my family and friends grew concerned and I decided I'd just try and maintain it. It worked for a while. I began excercising, eating more, getting into a good shape, received compliments, and for the first time in a long time I actually liked my body (even though I was a underwight). Then Christmas came.

It was like I completely lost control again. I binge ate thousands and thousands of calories. I developed bulimia. I purged everyday, multiple times. I hated it. I tried to get back on track of a reasonable calorie intake, plus exercise. Didn't last long.

Around half way through January, I binged again, and again, and again, until it became an everyday thing. And then I'd purge, but I hated purging so much so I stopped. But I couldn't stop the binging. I gained a massive number of kilos in under two weeks which was a waayyy too quick time period and not at all healthy. I feel like I've entirely lost control again and want to make it stop. Im terrified of getting back into my binge eating disorder and (and I know it's bad to say) I'd rather be anorexic.

I'm so lost and sad and scared. I can't talk to a professional because I'm still a teenager living with my parents, and I can't talk to my parents either because they are the most hateful, selfish and critical people ever.

How do I stop binging. 
How do I get my control back.",1581854900,2/16/2020 6:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f4pv18/ive_lost_control_please_help_me/,16

She’s been my friend for about a year and a half now, and I used to vent to her a bit about feeling fat and disgusting. Today she texted me and told me she weighs what I used to weigh, where I weigh what SHE used to weigh (no numbers due to the rules, but there is a serious discrepancy and I am much heavier than before)! 

I don’t think she did it on purpose but today I binged on Lindor truffles my boyfriend got me for Valentine’s Day and now I can’t stop thinking of the calories in everything I’ve eaten and how now she’s prettier than me and I’m a pig and other self deprecating thoughts.

i posted on here a while back abt getting bad again. to kinda run over everything, i’ve been in recovery since may last year and let’s just say it really hasn’t been easy. i kinda pulled myself out of getting bad last time and i was doing alright. i was doing more than alright, i was at a healthy weight again after five years of this hell. 

but now i’m getting bad again, again. and the worst part is, i don’t care. i don’t care abt anything anymore. my depression has been kicking my ass at the same time as all of this and most of the time i just want to go back to before i started recovery. i keep binning food and i do it subconsciously, like i don’t realise i’m doing it. look at food and the thought of eating and makes me feel sick. i don’t want to recover. i don’t and that’s the truth. i’ve known that since i first went into recovery involuntarily.  

i’m gonna get out of this, even if it takes years and years. even if it’s that long till i’m ready. i’ve worked far too hard and for far too long to let it destroy me again. i’m gonna recover someday, but it might take me a little longer.",1581799228,2/15/2020 14:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f4fciq/getting_bad_again_again/,1

4869,f4codo,Anorexia hospitalization?,"(delete if not allowed)

Hello everyone, I have a pretty pressing question, so I'm hoping someone here can tell me what I should do/expect.

I see my therapist about once every one to two weeks through the health services provided by my university. She's been asking me to get my vitals checked for a while now, but she recently told me that if I continue losing weight without getting checked out, at some point she's not allowed to see me anymore. That upset me a bit, because I do like her, so I agreed to go get my vitals checked and now I have to see a doctor again this Wednesday and then keep doing this once a week.

But the problem now is that I run the risk of being hospitalized. I don't think I'm bad enough to actually stick me anywhere at the moment, but I don't really plan on stopping because I've been doing good with losing weight. However, I'm also in my last semester of my undergrad and taking the capstone class for my major on top of a senior thesis. The goal after graduation is to get my own apartment so I can finally start transitioning, as I've been a closeted trans man since 2013 because my family is transphobic. I'm extremely worried that if I'm hospitalized, I'll be in there long enough that I'll end up having to drop out of my classes or something and then I won't get a degree which means I can't get a job that can support my monthly budget for living on my own + help me get into another program that starts in Summer of 2021.

What happens when you're hospitalized for anorexia? How long does it take? And should I stop going to therapy and stop seeing the doctor so I don't have to run the risk of being put there? I would be really sad to quit therapy because it's helped me out a lot, but if this is going to throw my whole life off track... desperate times call for desperate measures.

And because I dropped another chunk of weight quickly in the preceding weeks so it’s stalled again. I know this happens every time. I know that if I don’t eat something in the next 48 hours before I see my doctor I’m getting hospitalised unless I lie about having eaten. I know all this.

So I’ve been like *trying* to recover for the past week, thus I’ve been eating. I hate eating in front of people, especially my roommates. In fact I really can’t remember the last time I ate in front of someone. So I brought my crockpot into my bathroom (I have my own bathroom in my room that I pay extra for) and it’s a literal disgusting MESS right now. Please don’t judge. I mean, you can. I don’t care about strangers judging though. Like it’s bad...eggshells on the floor and in the sink, small pieces of broccoli in the sink...have I washed my hands in the past week? No. I’ve been severely depressed. It’s been the worst past two weeks of my life. Anyway. So my roommate has her boyfriend and her friend from work over...it’s 4am in the morning and they JUST went to sleep recently and stopped being so loud and obnoxious. I’m still up. I see my door start to open. Her friend comes in and I immediately sprint up and I’m like “my bathroom is a literal mess right now...like it’s not usable”. He just nods his head and proceeds to use my bathroom. Now he’s probably going to tell my roommates and I’m going to absolutely die from shame and embarrassment. I never want to eat again now. There was literally another bathroom in the hall. If someone was using it, you could have waited. This is a trigger I did NOT need right now.

*edit* oh, but wait. To add to the dramatic effect of “my life is in shambles” aesthetic, my scale is just lying there broken to pieces with a hammer right next to it.

I ate the foods I wanted while also eating healthy and working out and I felt strong and powerful but then on Wednesday and Thursday I’ve started binging again (I used to binge and restrict) and now all I want to do is restrict because if I still binge while eating healthy then what’s the point ya know ?",1581667448,2/14/2020 2:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f3p3wa/recovery_binging/,6

4894,f3m25r,I can’t even look in the mirror. I can’t enjoy the little things.,"I always try my best to avoid mirrors. When I’m brushing my teeth I avoid making eye contact with myself. When there’s a mirror in front of me I shift my body to the right as quickly as possible. If someone is looking in the mirror and they point at something on it I’ll just nod and stare from the distance. I can’t even hold my baby in front of the mirror with my whole body in it.

When someone tells me they’re going to take a picture of me I start to panic. I start thinking of my body. I try to suck in. I try to sit up. When they show me a picture I’m in I look at the other people and smile but I never look at myself bc I’m afraid to look and feel the gut sinking feeling. I can’t take family pictures. 

My bf can’t hug me or put his hands around my waist without me feeling disgusting. I think to myself how sorry I am that he has to be with someone like me. I try to wiggle around so he doesn’t feel all my rolls. 

I can’t enjoy the little things.",1581650527,2/13/2020 21:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f3m25r/i_cant_even_look_in_the_mirror_i_cant_enjoy_the/,2
4895,f3l8lu,Food is my most f'd relationship.,"I've been dealing with ana for 15 years now thinking that I had things under control. I avoided weighing myself or tracking my diet, rid myself of all triggering imagery and rhetoric. Finally I was working out for health, I became a yoga instructor that volunteers for body positive workshops, I could not think about my size. Or so I thought. Recently, things have started to slip back to a bad place. It first was little things like noticing a women's body size and finding myself fetishizing overly thin physique. I started indulging my thinspo, which spiraled into pinching, body shaming, guilt when eating. I feel embarrassed eating around people again, I am completely uncomfortable in my body at all times. Yesterday I made the mistake of weighing myself while at the gym and realized I gained weight...now I cant get off the couch, I've slept for hours and have to force myself to eat. I realize I was only okay because I was still avoiding my coping. I was working out excessively to the point of destroying my body just so that I could feel okay. But I'm not. When I'm not teaching yoga I'm doing it or at the gym or hiking or whatever active motion I can do to physically and metaphorically run away from this monster that is ED. Ana is that ex I think I've left behind but really has been in my bed controlling my head the whole time. I know she's bad, but I want that feeling of emptiness, airiness, thinness...",1581646676,2/13/2020 20:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f3l8lu/food_is_my_most_fd_relationship/,0

4900,f3inh2,Can't cut the circuit,"I thought I was recovered. After all, I was eating. Every month that I forced food down my throat, I counted as a victory. But eating doesn't mean recovery.

On paper, I'm 3 years into ""recovery"". I can say I've been ""healthy"" on a BMI chart for the last two. I'm no longer fainting in showers, struggling to open doors, falling down stairs, my heart doesn't feel like it's going to stop whenever I walk up a slight incline. I can wear my winter coat and not feel like I'm wrapped in a blanket of bricks, it's so heavy on me. I'm not on the verge of dying. But my brain is still fucked.

All this time I was lingering on the border between ""healthy"" and ""underweight"". Now I've slipped. I don't know when it happened, but it did. I can see it in the mirror now - and knowing it only makes me feel better. I tried to cut the circuit, to stop seeing sickness as success, but I can't. 

It's been three years of me lying to myself, and now, only now, I realise how flimsy my whole web was. I still count calories, still search for the salads on the menu, still over-exercise, and all this without even thinking. Yes, stress has been worse lately. I'm in therapy to deal with trauma from years of sexual abuse in my childhood. I'm cutting people out of my life - family members - because I have to, because they've hurt me over and over, but the texts and calls still come through. And all the while, in the background of this ""healing"" and ""recovery"", my brain has stayed set on self-destruction.

I never could cut the circuit. Now I've slipped and I don't even want to get up. Everything about me is weak. I'm not 16 anymore, I shouldn't be falling back on that sick girl, but the truth is that sick girl never left.

I’ve developed acid reflux from purging. I’m cold all the time because I refuse to eat. We were talking about it and I felt like my empathy was so fake. She doesn’t deserve that. There’s nothing she did to deserve going through that. But I’m doing this to myself. I’m the reason I’m always cold and dizzy. I’m the reason I have acid reflux. It’s all me. What’s even more fucked up is I just kept thinking “I wish I had that problem so I could avoid eating.” Like wtf? Who looks at a friend who’s having very distressing medical issues and feels jealously because it makes them lose weight? We did emphasize over how people worry about us. I get told by my dietitian and therapist and best friend all the time I could die and she said people say the same thing to her. But like, I need to be told that. But she doesn’t. She knows.

I have good excuses, good enough anyway. “I’ve been exercising, I got a job so I’m walking more, I’ve been trying to eat healthier” (I stopped eating again I stopped eating again shouldn’t someone be worried??)

I tried to tell people. It... didn’t help. Nothing happened. No one changed. And I feel like I can’t even talk about it at this point. Like... my sister just got hospitalized. I can’t tell my parents; I can’t do this to them while they’re dealing with her. But it’s always something... There’s always someone more important. I’m not important. I’m okay with not being important. I’m stronger than they are. I can do this. It’s okay.

I’m never going to eat again. I feel so sad right now. Everything is falling apart and I don’t know what to do about it I wish I could just fix it just fix it why the hell can’t I fix it??? I should be better than this

I just want it all to stop for a second. Let me catch my breath. I don’t know if I even really have a problem I’m such a hypochondriac but there’s other things to worry about I guess. It doesn’t even matter.

As soon as we get on I see my old classmate, she was one of the skinniest popular girls. And tbh, we never got along. Terrified I asked my mum where she wanted to sit. And she decides to sit RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER. I felt so fat. I had gained weight since I last saw her (I had surgery and couldn’t move for about two months). I was already chubby to begin with but now I felt HUGE. She looked at me and looked back down at her phone. I felt so disgusting. She was already skinny but now she was SUPER SMALL AND DAINTY.

She told me whenever she felt hungry she'd selfharm at the time I thought it was a rather stupid thing to do we talked or more or less complained about our shared struggles.
She later moved school and went into recovery. 



I the dumb bitch I am didn't take any notice of any doctor and my ed got worse my diagnosis changed and I later gave into the coping mechanism she used to use. I'm now cutting myself if I go slightly over the low calorie limit I've set myself. Ignoring my families pleads to recover, doctors, psychiatrists and therapists advice and running away at any chance I can take to get out of an appointment.

I’m tired of being found with food “I thought you didn’t eat” in all the wrong places. I’m tired of having to hunt high and low for a place to b/p (I have a roommate). I’m tired of “oh my god, you eat so much at a go, how are you so thin?” Because i f purge. But they don’t know. And I’m tired of being so guilty and ashamed when I’m caught out, like i have to maintain this perfect image of a girl who’s super clean and only eats salad what is she doing with this ton of food?
I’ve tried subtly explaining it but people are so. Dense. Unaccepting of mental health. Of days when I can’t focus on people or class and all I think is my ED (tbh, it’s always there but you know the moments when it fully consumes you) and people keep f interrogating. 
I b/ped today, walking out of the mess with a quite normal sized cup of noodles and still people stopped me to judge me. Sometimes I feel like f telling everybody.

My cousin (17F) is like my younger sister. I have 2 siblings and she has none so I’ve taken the older sister type of role in her life, and she tells me everything. I was the first person she came out to and that means a lot to me. I love her with all my heart and I don’t know how to help her.

A couple months ago she was diagnosed with anorexia, but I knew atleast a month or 2 before something was wrong. She barely ate, which wasn’t like her as we’re both big eaters. She was loosing a lot of weight, often looked sick, and was tweeting on her ‘spam’ twitter about how she was fainting all the time. I reached out to her and she had told me she was struggling, so I went with my aunt and her to see a doctor. 

She was getting better, until recently. I’m not sure what happened, she got into all the universities she loved, got a girlfriend, got a job, but just crashed. She’s eating less and less, constantly comparing herself to others, and fainting so much that she has bruises. She said she doesn’t even see a point in recovering anymore. Nothing I seem to do or say can help, and it really fucking breaks my heart seeing it. 

Please tell me how I can help, even if it’s just something small I can say or do. I try to go over to her house almost everyday and get some food or atleast lots of water into her, but I’m in uni and work so sometimes I just have to call.

5068,f6oqyv,Update,"TL;DR: went to see more professionals and getting different answers and conflicting whether I have an actual issue or not. 


I went to see my doctor yesterday. At first I felt so fucking stupid. She knew why I came in, that I was having restrictive eating behaviors and having a lot of trouble with it. So, she started asking about other aspects of anorexia to see if I had those as well. “Did you lose your period? Are you over exercising? Have you tried to purge?” To name a few. To most of her questions I answered no. I felt like a fucking joke. If I don’t have more behaviors such as those, how can I even classify this as an issue? Why was I wasting her time with my bullshit? And then, after the questions, she started to talk. She gave me a 20 minute lecture on how I was going to fuck up my body and natural state and health for the rest of my life if I continued on this track. She told me that she wanted me to start eating triple the amount I am now, and that she didn’t want me to lose anymore weight. All of this took me by surprise, as I’m not underweight. Quite the contrary, I JUST got down into a “healthy weight” BMI. She also wants me to meet with a psychiatrist, and a dietitian. I’ve only been bad for about two months now, I don’t understand. I’m not suffering from many physical side effects of losing too much weight because I haven’t yet. The only thing I’m doing is eating very little every day. I don’t understand. I feel like I have no issue at all, that I’m full of shit, but also like this is a real issue. I’m being compliant with all my doctor says to do, so that’s something I guess. She should get back to me with my blood results. If there’s nothing wrong with my blood I feel like I’ll be crushed. If there are no physical damages, then there’s no issue.

And when I feel my stomach and back it feels like there’s just rolls of fat. But I just looked in the mirror for the first time in a while and I can see my bones. I’m absolutely terrified of scales and I don’t trust them at all so I haven’t looked at my weight... I hate this.

5074,fbkie2,Anorexia sufferers - What words/phrases/actions made an impact on you?," 

Hey everyone.

I myself suffer from BED and keep moving from one spectrum to the other, so yeah, still on my own way battling my demons.

This is, however, not about me. It's about teens who suffer from various Eating Disorders (Mainly Anorexia, but also Bulimia, BED, Obesity, Orthorexia, etc) who seek counseling and help in clinics that are located in my area. I work in a field close to the clinics and frequently come in contact with these teens, regularly having convos with them while they wait. I've heard sensitive information with individuals seeking advice and feedback.  
In other words, this is nothing I take easily.

I really wish I could give support and aid them with something useful, so I wondered if perhaps I could ask the people here for something substantial. I'm also grateful for advice on what to avoid.

Thank you for any serious input!",1583016386,2/29/2020 16:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/fbkie2/anorexia_sufferers_what_wordsphrasesactions_made/,3

5086,fb9ccz,How to Write an EDed Character,"I was inspired by Binyavanga Wainaina's satirical piece called ""How to Write about Africa"". Sorry if this offends anyone, this was written very quickly as sorta a rant as media had/has a large role in driving me forward out of a need to reach validation and the ""standards"" in films and TV.

If your character has bulimia or anorexia make sure they're extremely underweight and if they have BED make sure they're obese. If they are ever normal weight and anorexic, make sure that they lose at least 1/3 of their weight in **one** restriction phase in under a school year. Either way, your character must be a white girl in high school. If they have bulimia or anorexia make sure they have none of the unglamorous symptoms such as hair falling out, skin discoloration, acne, bad breath, weird weight distribution, a snailed paced metabolism, or excessive body hair. The only symptoms allowed is looking tired (with obvious eye circles, nothing behavioral besides spacing out), being cold, and having Russel's sign if they are bulimic. Make sure to never show an anorexic person successfully purging (attempts are fine) or **ever** binging. If they are anorexic, they must be blonde, attractive, wear a baggy top, and be kind and self-sacrificing at all times (unless at the climax in your movie). The climax for either bulimia or anorexia must be the main character either blowing up at their loved ones or passing out. If your character has BED, they must be skinny by the end of the film/show and the climax must be them hating their body or finally decided to “take control of their life”, because remember, in the end eating disorders are just switches that with a little bit of rehab or help are curable. Never show your character relapsing near the end of your movie because the only good ending for the mc is being “fully recovered”. As well, your character must either have a horrible dysfunctional family or be in a rich household with well-intended but misinformed parents. Siblings are encouraged and they must never be rude to the mc. You must have at least one scene with your mc crying because they think they're ugly, whether to a bf, parent, or friend. If your movie takes place in rehab, the other girls (with, optionally, one boy or LGBTQ+ character) must be weird at first but slowly connect with the mc through relatable humor. Your main character must have a scene breaking down their disorder, cause, and psyche perfectly, of course guided by the first google result for ""eating disorder symptoms"". If your character has anorexia, they must freak out at having anything ther than an apple especially&gt;! pasta, a sandwich, or broccoli/carrots/green beans!&lt;. You also must include the line, ""you were such a happy kid, what happened?"" in your film at least once. As well, they must have body dysmorphia, but make sure to never actually research what bd is, just make them vaguely say, “I hate my body” while toying with fat in a spot that have almost none if anorexic/bulimic or their arms/tummy if with BED. If they have a love interest, make sure that they somehow fix all of their self-confidence issues and never include toxic romantic relationships. Finally, remember that every single person with anorexia organizes their food by size or color.",1582962639,2/29/2020 1:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/fb9ccz/how_to_write_an_eded_character/,0

I have no one to ask about this and google isn't any help.",1582859965,2/27/2020 21:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/fao8fm/feeling_faint_after_i_eat/,24

5115,faex50,I have been recovering for a long time and this is my first hard relapse.,"Recently, I have been going through the first BIG break up of my life, four years to be exact (If you want more info on this I have made several posts the past few days on various subs). After my break up, I have found no motivation to eat food anymore. I know I should eat, I had been healthily eating for a while now and this isn't a good relapse. However, I can't bring myself to eat food. I tried the first day after my break up but everything tasted just wrong in a sense. I don't feel hungry really, yet my stomach hurts. I feel like my mind wants food, my body doesn't need it. People are starting to ask me when was the last time I ate and I know I cannot tell them without them worrying so I have been lying. How do I go about my life with a sense of normality anymore? After my life has been flipped upside down, how do I get to being okay again?",1582822099,2/27/2020 10:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/faex50/i_have_been_recovering_for_a_long_time_and_this/,1

5120,fablnm,Let’s flood this subreddit with love!!,"Hey guys, I’m gonna tell you a little bit about myself. I’m 30 years old I have dealt with anorexia for most if not all of my life. I struggle on a daily basis to attain my goals of normal eating habits and of thinking that being a normal weight is OK. I have done well in the later years of accepting normal eating habits. Although I still struggle from time to time.
About me in short...
I moved from the East Coast to the West Coast to start a food truck (Believe it or not I’m a chef). Well my partner “supposedly”, was not ready and I’ve wasted my time and my money, both things that are very valuable to me. I’m Moving back to North Carolina to have a stable life to have a fighting chance to overcome all of my vices. 
I say this to say that I am stressing out...and this sub has opened me up to so many like me that are going through a constant battle and all we can do is push through and fight back! You are a warrior and you will prevail! 

Peace is a lie there is only passion
Through passion I gain strength
Through strength I gain power 
Through power I gain victory 
Through victory my chains are broken.

Always with love
