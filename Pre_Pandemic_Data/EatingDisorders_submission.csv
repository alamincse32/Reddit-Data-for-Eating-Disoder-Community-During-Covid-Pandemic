0,82ssma,"Request: What to do now? Gaining weight, afraid of relapse","I've been in recovery for quite a few months now and I've been doing well until recently. I've been under very high stress these past few weeks...this combined with the fact that I am recovering and I'm a big stress eater has caused me to overshoot my pre-ED weight. (I haven't weighed myself, but my clothes don't fit the way they do even before my ED began.) For obvious reasons this has caused me a lot of distress. I can FEEL a relapse coming on - I have a lot of work to do and midterms to study for but all I can do is think about what new food rules and exercise schedules I should follow and googling ways to lose weight again. I'm so frustrated because I thought I was doing well but now I feel like a full recovery will never be possible. I don't know what to do anymore because I feel like my therapist isn't always very helpful either, and she actually suggested that we see each other less often now that it's been a few months of me improving. What should I do? I'm STILL gaining weight and I know I can't keep this up forever because I'm already slightly overweight. How do I keep this under control without relapsing into my ED again?

1,82ncqj,Request: Questions about treatment program,"I am going to the Eating Recovery Center in Colorado soon for treatment for Bulimia. I'm super nervous about a couple things

I am an athlete with fitness goals, will I be allowed to exercise? If I bring some bands can I do some calisthenic training on my own or will they assume that there's something wrong with me.

Will I be forced to eat beyond my will? Will they force me to eat a specific amount of food or can I choose to eat what feels right?

Do they try to teach me that ""Obtaining a good physique"" is unhealthy? I honestly don't believe in ""body acceptance"" and think people should work to improve themselves physically.

Is it in any way possible that I can be released from treatment early? They plan to have me for 4 weeks, and I have only been struggling with bulimia on and off for a few months and am also at a perfectly healthy body weight.

Any informed answers will be well appreciated.",1520418952,3/7/2018 4:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/82ncqj/request_questions_about_treatment_program/,14
2,82nc86,Request: Confused. Do I need help?,"Before I start I know I sound silly. I’ve had on and off periods where I binge and purge. This has been going on for about four or so years. Bad at first then went away for awhile, then came back, then went away for awhile and now it’s back. I’ve never told anyone while it was happening because I have always thought that it was something I had control over. I do it when I want to lose weight and lose it fast, so I cut corners. Once I lose the weight i want, I stop. Each time I do it I remind myself that it’s only temporary and that if I want to stop I can. 

I guess what I’m questioning is that, is this temporary or do I actually need help? I’ve gotten scary good at hiding it. I know if I need help I have support around me but at the same time I feel like I don’t need help because once I lose the weight I’ll stop. I don’t want to make anyone worry because I feel like it’s unnecessary worrying because it’s “something I can handle” Once again I know this is silly and confusing but I just don’t know what to think.

I'm fairly well-recovered physically, though have found myself to be becoming more and more mentally precarious in the last couple of months. My diet is still fairly limited (always has been, even before any actual disorder showed up) and I'm expecting that I'm going to have to cut things out of my diet as a result of the chronic daily pain my IBS is causing. The last few days, my eating has been almost non-existent and my symptoms have been hugely relieved, which is reinforcing my disordered behaviour.

I'm currently in general counselling, but have no ongoing ED-specific support and I don't feel like it's something I have either the time or money to access right now. I'm terrified about what'll happen if I need to start restricting my food intake again, especially if the cause turns out to be a food I rely on to eat enough.

7,82i67s,Request: Binge eating disorder (Bodybuilding),"Hey everyone.

I‘m a girl, I‘m 20 y/o and I have been doing bodybuilding for 2,5 years. I‘m very passionate about fitness, I train a lot &amp; love lifting heavy weights. One of my biggest dreams is going on stage (bikini fitness).

I have had a problem with binge eating disorder, since I have started with bodybuilding. I started Sep 2015, and by April 2016 I lost a significant amount of weight. I started binging in January. It happened very often. I managed it to keep the diet for a few days/weeks, then binged. I was thin at that time, but I didn‘t see it. I wanted to lose weight and have less body fat. In May 2016 I ‚gave up‘. For about 2 months I ate without counting calories &amp; weighting my food. I gained back much of the weight I had lost. Then I started dieting again. And binged. And dieted again and again. It never lasted more than 1 month. It‘s been like this till today. I never manage to keep the diet for more than 1,5 months. I give up, I start binging. I eat everything I don‘t allow myself when I‘m on diet.

During this time I‘ve been training a lot, the first 2 years about 6 times a week, now 4-5. I can‘t understand why this is happening! Why can‘t I normally cut and then normally bulk? I don‘t believe it‘s about discipline, when I‘m about to binge all my dreams about bikini fitness, low body fat percentage, sixpack etc disappear, there‘s only food on my mind. Even though I know I will feel guilty, I will never make my dreams come true this way and that I‘ll regret it. I‘m sick of diet, I‘m sick of trying and I don’t know what the reason is!!! I have not been bullied as a child, I have loving boyfriend and family who care about me, I had a good childhood, I study... I have never done an extreme low-calorie diet or something like this, when I try to cut, my calories are not very low !! So I cannot understand why I binge all the time!

Any of you had similar experiences? How do you fight with BED? Do you have any idea what could be the reason in my case and what I should do?

Greets!

when I met my recent girlfriend I saw right away that she used to be annorexic. She is very beautiful and while she is not annorexic anymore (and hans't been for a long time apparently), she is still highly undernourished in my opinion. Before we were together, her diet consisted mainly of water and food supplements ans she would try to keep her weight (at least not lose any more weight) although she wouldn't tell me how much she's at (which I'm fine with). After talking to her she slowly started eating more and is trying hard to change her eating habits. Strangely enough though, after starting to eat more she lost weight for the first time in years. How is this possible? Is this normal? What can we do? I started googling for ""eat more lose weight"" etc. but all those articles are directed towards people who want to keep losing weight by eating more (what?).

I've been here a month so far and have been yo-yo losing and gaining some several pounds. I eat a plant-based diet and the facility has been accommodating in that regard, but I've found that each time they weigh me (every week or so as part of their routine) I've gained a couple pounds. I know this would most likely be due to me going back for seconds at meal times, or eating large portions when we have an outing and go out for dinner. But I guess I want control over what I consume, not just the portions. I am also currently a bit overweight (although I used to be underweight when my ED first developed). Does anyone have any tips on how to manage weight loss when you aren't in charge of what's served to you? Should I simply eat less and find time to exercise more?

14,81dc92,Request: Questions about IOP Treatment,"Hi there,

I’ve been struggling with my ED really badly for the past year. My therapist wants me to go to IOP treatment, because she’s says I need more intensive support ASAP and that I’m “heading fast towards the inpatient direction.” I don’t disagree that I need help, because I’m miserable as I am. However I’ve never been to formal ED treatment before (when my ED started in high I self recovered), so I have no idea what it is like. I’m also really afraid that since I’m technically a healthy weight everyone there will think I’m a sham and that I don’t deserve to be there.

I’m definitely going to look into whatever places my therapist refers me to, but I’m just really nervous and would appreciate if someone could provide a little insight into what to expect (especially if you’ve been to treatment in the Bay Area)

These are my main questions: 

- how long does it last? 

- what is it like on a daily basis? 

- is it difficult to get it covered by insurance (I have pretty good insurance thankfully) 

- how to juggle work and treatment? (I work full time) 

- what if the people doing my assessment think I need a higher level of care? (I tell my therapist a lot but there’s still a good chunk of things I struggle with that I haven’t told her about because I’m too ashamed)

17,84i0vj,Request: Does this sound more like BED or Bulimia?,"Can I ask how you all would label this? My new therapist suspects I have non-purging bulimia, which I had never considered. I had self-diagnosed myself with BED. I need to give you my whole background on the various relationships with food/weight I’ve had, but I will try not to get too long.

As a child, I was chubby. My doctor said so and so did other kids. Around age 12 I got the typical (sadly) obsession with being thin. You know the usual. Always crash dieting and having “you’re so much skinnier than me!” conversations with my friends. As I became a teenager, I did become thin, though I still couldn’t see it. But at [redacted], I know for a fact I was thinner than I thought. Looking at old photos now always blows my mind, and makes me suspect I had BDD at the time. I should tell you, I was close with an unusual proportion of people with eating disorders. Three close friends, one of whom was my romantic partner at the time, were hospitalized for several weeks-months for anorexia/bulimia on separate occasions. And that’s not everyone I knew with EDs, just the ones who had to go inpatient in high school.

So, college. Freshman year I learned about feminism and did my best to completely diverge from the obsession with thinness. Tried to liberate my mind/body, you know? I gained a little weight, but not much. My mental health was worsening in other ways though, in terms of depression. Then, my second year of college, early in first semester, I got sick. Just, all of a sudden one day, I woke up, threw up, couldn’t eat the rest of the day. My entire semester followed that routine, as my depression and anxiety got worse and worse, and I was suicidal. I would wake up each day, throw up, not eat all day, and then at night I would smoke weed and have a bagel. I probably had full meals a total of [redacted] times that semester. I was really skinny, wasn’t weighing myself so I don’t know a number but probably below [redacted]

So then I was prescribed medicine to help with my loss of appetite and extreme nausea (which, after blood tests, they figured must be caused by my anxiety, which in turn caused nausea, so I was stuck in a cycle). The medicine enabled me to eat! And I gained weight. But I tried to be feminist about it and be okay being fat because at least I wasn’t throwing up every day and wanting to die and failing and dropping classes. I still had a low appetite unless I smoked though. So I still wasn’t really eating during the day, but I was able to eat more than just a bagel for dinner. I also got addicted to sugar and would eat literally giant bags of m&amp;ms or sour patch kids. Always at nighttime.

I graduated college and slowly learned how to eat at work. At first I would go to work and not eat all day since I couldn’t smoke, and then have one meal at night. Then I started having snacks at work and so on etc: I basically finally began to be able to eat small amounts without smoking. But then I got the psychological dependence of the reassurance of a big meal at the end of the day. If I was having a bad day at work I would think “it’s okay, you can go home and eat an entire pot of pasta and feel happy”. And so now I’m very overweight, nearly obese but not quite.

These days, I try to eat cereal in the morning, have a few snacks or a sandwich during the day, and come home and still have the craving to stuff my face. And I often make myself very nauseous by overeating. Like I’ll basically finish a meal that should really have leftovers, and then I’ll eat a ton of candy. It makes me sleep terribly and feel so anxious due to the nausea. I’ve thrown up a few times from too much sugar. And it makes me hungover. Literally. I feel sick the next day after a carb/sugar binge. All that said, I still have terrible appetite when my routine is changed. So like, when I traveled last year for a funeral, I ate like, crackers and carrots when I could, but had no meals at all for a few days. People always say “Really??” when I tell them I have appetite issues because I’m so big and it doesn’t make sense to them.

So, now I really want to stop binging so I can sleep better and not make myself nauseous and anxious. My primary reason is so I don’t feel physically sick. But in the back of my mind, the part that I try to ignore, I also want to be thinner so I can be more attractive/people pay me more attention. I hate that I think that by the way, like I deeply believe the feminist side that says people are attractive regardless of size, and it’s true in my opinion! But I still can’t shake the association that the reason people ignore me and hit on my roommate when we go out is due to me being fat.

So my therapist thinks I’m “restricting” during the day, but really I’m trying to eat as much as I can so I don’t have this fucked up metablism/appetite thing! However, is it possible that subconsciously I am restricting? Like, super super deeply sub-sub-sub conscious? I want to be thin, for sure, it’s a conscious thought that I try not to focus on. I primarily just want to be healthy. I know I don’t eat enough during the day and then eat way too much at night. But if I try to eat when I don’t have an appetite, I get nauseous.

I’m just so confused on if this is bulimia. I always thought I just had BED. But is my low appetite actually a form of restriction?

My gf has on a few occasions suggested that I have an ED, I know I have an unhealthy relationship with food but I'm not sure if it qualifies as an ED. I'll say a few things that I do/experience to see if others can can relate or not.

The thing that prompted her concern was that I had started eating one meal a day, usually at around 9 or 10pm when I was done work and classes for the day. I said it was because I didn't have time in the mornings and couldn't be bothered to bring or buy lunch but she's still worried. I'll regularly skip meals or forget to eat until I suddenly feel light headed and my hands get shakey and I'm reminded. I can't say I ever really eat due to hunger but rather boredom or depression. When I do eat I have to eat all of it. Bag of this box of that etc. Sometimes I'm able to not eat all of it, but it's rare if I don't eat to the point of feeling gross, bloated, sick, and hating myself. With junk food and sweets I'll often feel the need to eat all there is one day so that I can ""be good"" the rest of the week rather than try to spread it out into smaller portions throughout the week.

I also need to divide everything as evenly as possible. If there's 10 pieces of something I need to be guaranteed 5. I weigh myself a few times a day usually (0 to 3) and while I am still overweight and hate being overweight my weight remains fairly static overall.

Is any of this a cause for concern or do I just have bad eating habits ?

My sister is dangerously underweight, but not quite enough to be hospitalised. She goes through stages of trying to start to recover, but mostly she just seems to accept that it will never improve. To be honest, she is scared of going through recovery and doesn't want to start. She is not putting on any weight, and she's calculated about it, and keeps herself just above the point at which you get sectioned (I'm in the UK if that's different).

My family want to go on a long-haul holiday this summer for two weeks. But we don't know whether to take her (to be clear, we wouldn't go without her, it's all or nothing). To me it seems like madness considering how unwell she is, but if we said we couldn't go, she would go mad at us and probably wouldn't speak to us for weeks/would shun any help we tried to offer. I'm also worried it would negatively affect her mental state which isn't good for obvious reasons.

On one hand I really don't want to take away something she's looking forward to. On the other hand it seems stupid to take her out of the country, not to mention the stress it would put everyone (her and us) under in regards to eating out etc.

Which makes me angry because I feel like I’m still just another person who is bad at dieting. And I worry that if I take her advice, my binges will spiral even further out of control and I’ll gain weight. I know that logically, she is right (that the binges stem from the restricting), but I’m also not underweight and I am struggling to accept the fact that I COULD gain during this process.

Also, I let slip that I have had suicidal thoughts but I swear to god there is no “plan” to take action, it’s more of a mid-binge “wish I could disappear” kind of angst and general exhaustion with my life. I don’t feel that I am depressed, though I do struggle with anxiety and ADHD.

All of this started because I just wanted to do therapy to help me stop reacting to (mostly minor) stressors with binge eating, so that I could actually lose weight for good... and I feel like it has spiraled into her making it a much bigger deal than it really is.

I don’t know what to do. If I could accept my weight as it is, I could accept her ideas for “recovery”... but I don’t know how to get to that point, especially when an hour later my brain is telling me the entire thing is stupid, I’m wasting money on therapy, I don’t have an eating disorder, and I’m just another nobody with a high-end-of-normal-BMI and no willpower to meet my goals.

28,83nlwm,Request: Research participation request,"Hi all,

I work in a psychological research lab at the Portland State University. I’m currently running a study looking at the effects of weight stigma on underweight individuals. There is a great deal of research out there suggesting a strong and negative weight bias towards overweight individuals, though there is significantly less regarding the discrimination that underweight individuals face. The research that has been conducted is compelling, however, and we are looking to see how underweight individuals perceive the weight bias that they face.

For this study, we are looking for individuals over the age of 18 who have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 or less. Participation in the study requires a 1-hour conversation which can be conducted by phone so location is not an issue.

If you are interested in taking part or know of anybody who may be, please email me, cdoctor@pdx.edu. Feel free to direct any interest, questions, or comments to me there. I will also be checking back here regularly.

30,836tqi,"Request: Girlfriend seems to be ""better"" with Eating Disorder","So a little backstory: Been with my SO for a few years now, serious relationship where marriage is imminent within the next 2 or 3 years (we are both young and in no rush). My SO has struggled with depression for quite a while, and has always had self destructive coping mechanisms. Over the course of the past year this led to her developing disordered eating habits (not a diagnosed ED, because while she is seeking professional help it is not for eating issues as she does not want those addressed currently, but she has admitted on various occasions that its most likely an eating disorder). What I've noticed is that whenever she seems to be more engulfed in her disordered eating stuff (not sure what to call it, ED habits I guess for lack of better terms), she is doing better mentally, socially, etc. She fluctuates between these behaviors, sometimes for a month or two at a time, and when not engaging in ED stuff she is noticeably more depressed and struggles with other issues. I know she uses this to cope with issues she doesn't know how to deal with, as a way to have control over some aspect of her life, and because of this is happy with eating issue stuff. However, this leaves me in a precarious situation. I try to support her, but its hard when at the moment it seems like the best for her is to continue falling deeper into an eating disorder. There is so much more that I would like to vent/ask about, but I risk rambling on too much. Would just like some advice on how people think I should handle my side of this. (Side point she doesn't think I should have any input as she wants to deal with this on her own, which also means no support from me. This kinda seems like a way for her to not have to lose her current coping mechanism)

32,836t9a,Request: just feeling generally uncomfortable doing everyday things.,"I’ve had an ED for about 3 years now. It started off with a big weight loss, then extreme exercise and restriction, and then I would say I’ve been bulimic binge/purge for the past year a half. It sucks and comes and goes in waves. Right now I’m trying this thing where I just try to extend the time in between episodes— setting small milestones for myself— trying to go one week, then 8 days, 9 days etc without one and it’s been helping.

But sometimes I just feel uncomfortable simply existing... does anyone else feel these things?

Being uncomfortable getting dressed in the morning, knowing you’ll have to be naked and feel your body?

Showering, and having to look down and bathe?

I’ve also felt so uncomfortable when smoking weed, as if I just want to completely jump out of my body and like I’m going to have a panic attack from being inside it.

Simply having to look at a picture of myself, or in a mirror without having clothes on.

I have to wear a large sweater everyday at work because I feel too uncomfortable not wearing something baggy.

Sometimes I can’t even make myself clean up my apartment or go outside because I feel too bloated or fat and I just want to curl up in a ball and not be aware of my body.

To add to that, I have a pretty curvy body and I’ve been bestowed with a big bust. I also had one breast implant 6 years ago, which I think feeds into my discomfort with my body. But sometimes I feel hypersexualized because of this, and I just want to melt and not have anyone see me. Sometimes I even feel like at work, people are noticing my body and it makes me less professional. There’s been a lot of times where I wish my breasts were smaller because I don’t want the attention, especially with the ED.

It’s awful. The only times I feel confident about my body and my skin is when I’m working out, or when I feel empty or hungry. I always feel that after I eat, I’m bloated and disgusting and I can’t tell if this is just ED/BDD talking or if I actually am bloated.

I hate the delusional thoughts. Can anyone relate? Does anyone have advice?

33,836szs,Request: Post-assessment blues. Do I want to go into residential? Do I even have an eating disorder?,"First thing’s first, I know y’all can’t make this decision for me or diagnose me. I just need to vent.

Had some heart palpitations on Thursday, when I began to think that there might just be a problem. Had an assessment on Tuesday with my local Renfrew Center. They seem like good people. It started off with me asking them not to use the term “eating disorder” in reference to me and ended with them recommending residential when I didn’t even realize they had an inpatient facility. I thought at worst they’d recommend the day program and I could talk my way down to evenings so I wouldn’t have to miss work. So when they brought up residential I countered with not being able to miss that much work and they told me that I can schedule leave now or wait until I wind up in an emergency room and miss work then. They told me that I was too far off of the Ideal Body Weight for my size to be considered for outpatient, which I didn’t even realize was a thing. They said I need medical monitoring because I’m at risk for refeeding syndrome. I’m supposed to be visiting a potential grad school from March 21st to March 23rd and they treated this as a complete non-issue, stressing that the program is completely voluntary and I can come and go as I please.

Since then I’ve gotten an EKG, a physical, and a whole lot of labs. The only thing that has come back abnormal are ketones in my urine, which was to be expected. I work in medical research so I feel confident looking at bloodwork that I am not at risk for refeeding syndrome after all and I had a full meal last night that actually went pretty well. They are still recommending residential and now that I have confirmed my short-term disability coverage I am earnestly considering it, but a few things are giving me pause.

Today the woman who assessed me at my local Renfrew called to ask whether I would be willing to cancel my grad school trip. I told her no, that I had interviews scheduled with labs I wanted to rotate in, and she asked whether I could just do them over the phone. I told her no again, that enrollment decisions are due by April 15th and I cannot in good conscience commit to a doctoral program on a campus I’ve never seen with Principal Investigators I’ve never met. She said she would “check in” with the residential facility.

Obviously this is inconvenient, but it made me lose more than a little trust in this whole process. How can it be completely involuntary if they’re having to check whether I’m allowed to leave? And why were they so confident to begin with if this was the case? I told her that this could be a dealbreaker for me, because I struggle to think of myself as even having an eating disorder in the first place and was mostly open to treatment as maybe something worthwhile to check out before the stress of grad school, so if there is any chance of interfering with grad school… no fucking way. Now I don’t even trust that I’ll be able to go on my visit even if they say it’s been cleared with the facility and want to wait to schedule my admission for after my trip, if I go at all.

It’s been all of a week since I first thought I might not have as much control over this as I once thought so this is all still completely surreal to me. My head is fucking spinning and I do not know what to do.

36,860u2w,Request: What to do about my gf's parents?,"So my gf has EDNOS, a sum of not eating properly vs. binge eating.. She has had it for a while and she lives in a country where there is probably only little knowledge of the disease.. Her parents, especially her mum, thinks she is doing everything on purpose and they bombard her all the time about getting her sh*t together and stop loathing.. also they pressure her to get married, get a job, career etc.. irrelevant stuff that should not be a priority while she is sick..

That only makes my gf worse and makes her sad about feeling pressured and not good enough... sometimes even she goes into binging mode to try and diminish her anxiety, only leaving her feeling horrible afterwards..

Now I also assume her parents probably care about her much as a daughter and try to support her in some way, but I see they don't have a slightest clue how to act towards a diseased person.. I kind of feel very upset at them for saying the things they do but a small part of me understand they must feel very worried and tired too..

I haven't known them for a long time but have already had the courage to write a letter to them, which my gf translated to their native language since they speak only little English....I wrote about how much their daughter means to me and that we should work together to get her into a dietician and psychiatric help and not pressuring her all the time as it is counter intuitive.... and they seemed to like everything i said and they said they will try their best.. but only little has changed..

Her mum is still yelling to my gf about being the way she is and seems disappointed all the time at her.. she seems stressed more about stuff that shouldn't matter rather than the well being of their own daughter..

I don't know what to do.. it feels odd to preach to them as if I know their daughter better than they do.. but it seems to me like that.. and my gf told me I'm one of the few whom understands her and that her parents don't get her pain at all..

42,85f5ej,Request: Does this sound like disordered eating?,"Hi all!

All throughout my teen years, I struggled a lot with body image and with my eating. I would avoid eating for as long as possible (sometimes up to two weeks), attempt to throw up any food I ate, and drink a gallon of salt water when I ate to try and induce vomiting.

During this time period, I lost about a lot of weight. Once I stopped, I promptly gained it back and have been self-conscious of my body image and of my eating ever since. Now, about 8 years since this all started, I have realized that I'm transgender and that definitely explains the hatred of my body since birth. I've found a way to lose weight in a healthy manner and am down to a reasonably healthy, but still overweight place.

In the past few months, I have been losing weight for a surgery that I am having in two months. I fear not being healthy enough for anesthesia, even though I know that I will pass a physical and my blood work. I've been restricting my food, doing ""juice fasts"", regular water fasts, and just generally trying to limit my intake dramatically. I feel so guilty when I eat anything at all and I feel all of these disordered tendencies coming back to me. I'm not sure what to do to avoid going down this hole again.

It’s a complicated situation, because my “job” is to go through the 12 steps with her and guide her in her recovery from alcoholism/addiction. The problem is that she regularly tells me that she has binged and purged, and while I’m grateful that she feels comfortable confiding in me, I have no idea what to do to support her.

We’re taught that sometimes we have outside issues that require more than just working the steps. I am not a doctor. I’m unqualified (I feel) to help her in any way other than to listen and offer support. We’re also taught that we aren’t there to tell a sponsee what to do.

My question is, what are some things I can say when she regularly tells me about binging/purging? I am wondering what I can say when I’m not there to sponsee her in terms of an ED. I’m also worried maybe it’s a warning sign of a relapse in alcoholism/addiction, although that’s out of my control. We’re regularly dual diagnosis people, but at the same time she doesn’t seem to want recovery, just to tell me when she is acting in her ED (which is becoming more and more frequent).

I guess I’m looking for advice on how to support or guide someone in active ED while still maintaining my role as an AA sponsor. I’m also looking for advice on how to respond when she tells me about binging and purging when she doesn’t appear to want to stop or get help.

Any questions or clarifications needed are welcome. Also, I understand some people dislike AA and how it works. That’s totally fine, I’m just giving the situation. She also says she wants to work the steps and be in AA, so she’s not reluctant in that area.

Below is a description of the study 

Project Title: Investigating the Moderating Role of Rumination and the Relationship between Distress Tolerance and Disordered Eating

Project Description: Researchers at Deakin University are interested in Investigating the Role of Rumination (repetitive negative thinking) in relation to distress tolerance and disordered eating behavior for the general population.

If you are an adult and identify to engaging in disordered eating you are invited to take part in this study, where you will complete an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes questions around eating behavior, emotion regulation, body dissatisfaction and rumination. This will greatly contribute to our knowledge of how these processes interact with eating behavior.

The survey will take approximately 25 minutes of your time. All information is de-identified and confidential. If you would like further information on the study, please contact Alexandra Griffin

48,87uxqi,Request: I think our relationship is over,"My gf suffers with BED. We have had a really tough time over the last few months, so much to go into. I had been doing everything for her, enabling her eating disorder- we have had chats about all of this together. I started to become really numb, but then we had a massive outburst where we spoke about everything. Everything seemed great and things temporarily got so much better, but after reading up I feel like I have had growing resentment. Doing everything for her put so much strain on myself, it became so hard.

Granted I haven't given much detail, and this post may make me sound like a dick boyfriend, but the resentment from when I was doing everything for her has not left, I feel like it has just grown. I'm now feeling unhappy. Things just aren't the same anymore, and hasn't been for a while.

I feel like things are coming to an end, and I can't seem to face it. One of her ex boyfriends left her by saying he was unhappy and it completely broke her. I still love her, but like I said nothing feels the same anymore, it almost feels like I have subconsciously given up. Originally, I could picture our future together, but now it's like I can't see anything.

What is the best way to break up with someone with BED? We currently live together with 2 other people, so I know this would be awkward anyway. I just feel strained constantly.",1522266491,3/28/2018 14:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/87uxqi/request_i_think_our_relationship_is_over/,1
49,87shdy,Request: How do I help my GF understand triggers?,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about two months. We are very open about everything; she knows I've suffered from EDs and my relapses as well.

Last night, I was showing her pictures from high school, just so she can get to know me better, and a picture popped up of me showing off a bad sunburn I had on my entire back.

She then goes: ""Wow, you were so skinny!"" Those words hit me like a ton of bricks. She saw my face and then said: I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by that. I just assumed you got bigger, not smaller, when you had your eating disorder."" I was stunned. I didn't know what to say. She apologized again and then moved on from the subject. But I can't get her words out of my head.

How do I explain to her that it's not okay to say things like that? That it's really really triggering? I don't want her to think I'm being dramatic or overreacting.",1522248461,3/28/2018 9:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/87shdy/request_how_do_i_help_my_gf_understand_triggers/,4
50,87qljj,Request: Do I have an eating disorder? Desperate for advice or an answer.,"I have had this issue for so long but it’s becoming more prominent. Lately my body confidence has spiraled down at an unhealthy rate. I have no body at all. I am an A cup and I have no butt. I have been underweight for my short height and been the same weight since I was in high school (I’m almost in my 2nd year of college now). I hate looking at myself in the mirror lately because I always end up trying to make it look like I have a hourglass body that many people (especially men) seem to love nowadays by arching my back or trying to get the right angle. Every time I see a skinny model w/ a body type like mine, I always see people commenting how skinny they are and how disgusting it is that some women don’t have a big butt and and no boobs. Always seeing other people drag other skinny girls down for not being “thick enough”, telling them to eat more and to hit the gym. Seeing other women w a flat stomach w double cup boobs and an ass triggers my confidence and makes me feel bad abt myself. I feel like an embarrassment bc of how I have no body shape at all, I feel anxious whenever I’m walking by people thinking they’re staring at my body and making fun of how I have no body type. I have a childlike body and the feeling of not being good enough depresses me to the point that I don’t want to eat.

I have always coped w my anxiety/depression by not eating. It makes no sense to me and makes me feel crazy because I want to gain weight but I just don’t want to eat, I feel gross and my depressed emotions makes me lose my appetite. I get full very easily (always have), I don’t eat much protein to gain weight bc I hate meat , I don’t drink dairy bc i’m lactose intolerant, + eggs are gross to me (I have been wanting to go vegan for a long time). I don’t know how to gain weight bc of my picky diet that it makes me lose hope in achieving an hourglass body which makes me feel hopeless and leads me to become even more depressed abt myself. I have tried hitting the gym of course but no results because my non existent protein-less filled diet is not helping me build a body.

My self esteem has plummeted. The man I am madly in love w/ has a celebrity crush on a very slim thick woman and it makes me feel like he can do and find a better curvier woman than me. No matter how many times he tells me that he loves my body how it is now I can’t find myself to believe his words. His type has always been slim thick women and I am the complete opposite of that. Deep down I know he loves me for who I am but I cant accept it. I feel myself getting skinnier and my parents are starting to notice. Their constant words to me about how i’m “too skinny” now and that my skinny body is unattractive is making it even worse for me.

I have had this issue for months and I feel like I am getting worse. My insecurities is making me push away the man I am in love with and I don’t want to lose him over this. I don’t know if i have a disorder or a problem or if i’m just sounding like a whining idiot. I know this is not the exercising community but if anybody has any tips of how to gain weight in my emotional situation or if anybody has gone/is going through this it would be much appreciated.",1522230126,3/28/2018 4:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/87qljj/request_do_i_have_an_eating_disorder_desperate/,2
51,87h4u7,Request: Healthy heart rate after recovery,"I'm wondering if anyone has had noticeable heart problems after recovery. It has been 8 years since I was last hospitalized for an ED and I have been in ""recovery"" since. There was a period two years ago that I was once again restricting, but I believe it's under control. The severest case was, again, 8 years ago. Back then I had bradycardia (irregular heart beat) but since I haven't noticed anything about my heart that was cause for concern.

However, I have recently started exercising again. I believe it is a healthy amount of exercise, and I try not to go to extremes, but I have noticed while doing aerobic activity that my heart rate has gone up to 205 BPM (I hope this number is okay?). My average heart rate is 167 BPM according to the machine, but 205 seems much higher than it should, and I also feel lightheaded after stepping off the machine (despite doing cooldown to bring my rate to 140ish BPM).

Is this okay? Am I okay? I think I am eating enough. I am at my lowest healthy weight, but I'm happy with the way I look for once and eat regularly according to hunger, so I think I'm in a good place. I only go to the gym twice a week and do not stay on the machine for more than 45 min. Have any of you experienced a high heart rate during recovery, such as this? Should I be going to the doctor-- or rather, what should I be looking for here?",1522144101,3/27/2018 4:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/87h4u7/request_healthy_heart_rate_after_recovery/,5
52,87h4mf,Request: Seeking help but feeling like a fraudster,"I’ve been purging via laxatives for nearly two years. It used to be every week, almost without fail. I used to attend a weight loss group and I couldn’t stand having not lost anything, so I’d take a good number. On top of that, I’d try and keep to a healthy meal plan and as soon as I started counting calories I would get panicky and agitated and NEED to binge. So there was always this need to take laxatives.

It’s slowed down a lot recently but I’m still constantly thinking about them. I’m heavier than I ever have been and it’s driving me mad but I know I have to be healthy otherwise it’ll get worse.

The reason I’m finally choosing to get help is because of Friday- we had pizza at work, I felt numb after eating it and this uncomfortable nausea hit me. So actually purged- it wasn’t a lot but the fact I suddenly didn’t feel bloated was good- I know it shouldn’t be and I’m avoiding large meals now just in case.

But despite all of this, I feel like my gp will just tell me it’s a phase, like it’s nothing to worry about. I keep telling myself I’m not actually sick, like it is nothing to worry about when I know it probably isn’t.

I’m just freaking out a little- I want to hide and not go but at the same time, I do want to get help. Yet there’s a part of me that says “you’re not sick enough, don’t bother.” Then there’s the part that’s terrified that in a few weeks I’ll actually have a diagnosis and I don’t know what to expect or think

53,87h4ed,"Request: Set point, overshoot and all that stuff - is there any truth in it?","I have a restrictive ED and I am underweight. I got sick at 24 yo when I had already completed my growth curve. I used to be the skinny one and effortlessly maintain a weight on the lower half of the 'healthy' BMI and before the ED I had never dieted, had any problem with my weight or even wondered what calories were.

I am growing more tired by the day; therapy is not helping that much and the dietitian does not really understand. Each day I get increasing urges to just let it all go and eat as much as I want, which right now means ALL THE FOOD IN THE WORLD. I am resisting for now, but I know that at some point I will just snap.

I have already tried it a couple of times. I 'snapped', ate all the food in super-vast quantities for some days or weeks, felt super-great and finally free, then I got scared and went back to my restrictive habits.

I am reading many articles about the set point weight - the idea that your body has a natural weight that it will set around and strive to maintain without any restrictive behaviour, and that if you have had a restrictive ED it often happens that, in order to reach that stable weight you first have to climb a little over it, so to allow your body to repair all the internal damage it suffered.

There does seem to be some scientific rationale/validation behind it, but it also seems a bit of a vague idea that just gets bounced from one recovery blog or youtube channel to another. Do you know anything about the whole thing? I just want to eat freely and mindlessly. I am so sick and tired of counting calories, weighing food, having low energy, pretending not to be hungry or not to like certain foods while the internal me is screaming ""OH MY GOD I WANT IT SO MUCH"", et cetera et cetera. But I am too scared to stop doing so, because I am terrified that I won't just return to my previous weight but I will keep on gaining into overweight territory or even obesity - my hunger is just that strong.

56,877s3j,Request: Did I have an eating disorder?,"When I was 13 I started to become very fixated on my eating and my body image. I did not particularly like the way I looked and even began to cut myself on my hips where I had some stretch marks. At this point I was a healthy weight for my age and body type, as I was always a small kid and I did not restrict my eating at all at this point.

As I entered high school and turned 15 I became increasingly obsessed with my eating. I restricted my calorie intake religiously to just a few hundred calories and weighing myself 2-3 times per day. My weight was the same as it was when I was 13 and no longer a healthy weight for my age. Because I never lost any actual weight since age 13, I became very frustrated that my efforts were leading to nothing - but I couldn't stop obsessing about food.

I couldn't focus in my classes because my head was full of calculating calories I had eaten that day and figuring out the best way to eat the least amount of calories for the rest of the evening.

I frequently ""body checked"" and spent hours and hours just staring at my body in the mirror. My self-harm got worse and more frequent. I started running and doing cardio to burn at least 200 calories a day. I tried to make myself throw up many times after eating ""too much"" - to no avail.

I kept all of this hidden from my family and often used tactics like eating slower, chewing more, or lying that I was feeling too sick too eat in order to get out of meals.

I was also extremely suicidal, and my suicidal feelings were heavily associated with these food issues.

I did not get my first period until after my eating became normal again when I was 16, and I also grew another couple of inches very quickly and gained about 20 lbs.

Sometimes I think about this time in my life and I can see that it was disordered, but I also often find myself questioning whether it was an actual issue or just a phase, since I did get over it, after all. I never received any help for these problems and to this day I still occasionally have thoughts about restricting to lose weight.

I thought it would be helpful to have others' opinions on this. Did I have an eating disorder? Was it just a weird phase that insecure preteens have? Should I have done something about it? Any responses are appreciated.",1522056100,3/26/2018 4:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/877s3j/request_did_i_have_an_eating_disorder/,7

62,86aafq,Request: Worried My Sister is Developing and ED - Part Ashamed Part Triggered,"I guess I’m just looking for some insight on how I might be able to handle this situation. I’m in my early 20s, and my sister is 6 years younger than me. She has lost a significant amount of weight and is continuing to lose weight. She used to be on the bigger side, so I understand her wanting to be more active and maybe lose a little weight but I started to get worried when I saw her reblog some eating disorder accounts on her Tumblr. I confronted her about it, but she brushed it off. She posts weight loss updates on her fake Instagram page I know about and the occasional self-loathing piece about food or weight. I don’t know what to do.

I suffered from anorexia turned to bulimia for 6 years and have since been doing a lot better. I would consider myself like 90% recovered. But I feel partially responsible because I feel like I set a bad example. I’ve generally had things easy when it comes to weight, I was small and only got smaller.. I don’t want her to think it’s the right way to feel good about yourself (it actually just made me hate myself more) and I honestly wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.

On top of this, the posts are making old feelings of mine creep up. I feel like I’m starting to get a little triggered by it and I really can’t afford to relapse right now. I’m in professional school and am already wearing myself thin... I want to help so much but I’m worried by helping I’m putting myself at some risk...

67,89svbj,Request: It is depressing,"Hello, I was a healthy slim child when I become 11 or something I gained a lot of weight I was not overweight but close. 

I got my first period then some people pointed out that I gained a lot and should be careful and I lost weight until I was nearly underweight but I don't remember if I was restricting or not and I also lost my period but I was young for it anyway. Then I slowly regained until I was 13 and I got my period for months. 

Then I started heavily restricting, didn't count calories but was hungry all time. My mother stopped me when I was a little underweight then I stayed there for a year and lost more weight after that. Then I was feeling so bad and I had headaches all time and I decided to gain a bit and then I was still underweight but less underweight and stayed there for a year with counting calories and eating near normal amount calories. 

Then I decided to recover forever and thought it wouldn't hurt to become high end normal weight. And stopped counting calories and started eating as much as I want. I ate a lot, just ate healthy food and never ate junk or something like that. Also I don't think I binge ate because I never ate until I was sick, I was just eating to satiety but i was really hungry! My mother said tough things to me since she thought I was eating until I was stuffed or eating emotionally. 

Now I am really overweight and I really regret that I was eating freely. And no I am not slightly overweight I am really overweight! Maybe near obese. I still don't get my period, don't eat junk but still have high appetite. I don't want yo diet but I don't want to stay overweight either. And god knows what if I gain more?! I should definitely restrict my calories but can't do it. I don't want to be hungry anymore. 

It is depressing, I feel so insecure, I don't want to go outside anymore, I don't feel attractive anymore. I don't know what to do. Can anyone offer advice?

Now that we're in college, it seems that she has relapsed (or perhaps she never truly recovered) and has shared with me what's going on, perhaps in an attempt to hold herself accountable. She is a thoughtful and self-reflecting person and so she realizes that she needs help and that's why she talks to me about this. I of course try to be as empathetic and supportive and loving as possible, but as I have no experience with this, I'm really struggling because I am incredibly concerned about her. Just a couple hours ago, I'm pretty sure she threw up in the bathroom right next to our room and I have no idea what to do.

I've read several guidelines online and posts on this sub but I am wondering what the best course of action would be for me to best support her and encourage recovery. She seems quite open to taking steps to recover but she still continues to restrict her diet, exercise a lot, and make herself throw up. How can I help?? I know it's a complicated and nuanced process but I really just want any sort of advice on concrete things I could say or behaviors I could encourage.

I was at a low weight until a few days ago, but in the last week I gained some weight through...well, let's call it binging for the sake of brevity, although it's not actually binging, but whatever. I am still underweight, but less than before. I am now thinking I should lose weight again just to meet him when I am at the lowest weight possible, so to be given a higher calorie diet plan - or to be able to follow a weight gain plan for a longer time. It's weird but I just so desperately want to eat, and my biggest fear right now is that a weight gain meal plan won't last long enough for me to experience 'mental shifts' as well as the actual weight gain - in other words I am afraid that, if I go to the dietitian at my current weight, the weight gain up to restoration will be too quick and I will soon have to follow a weight maintain plan which will leave me in a still messed-up state, only with some more kgs on my body (which is arguably even worse than now), therefore likely triggering a relapse all over again.

Do you think these are silly fears? Do you believe I should address these fears with both my therapist and my dietitian? Or am I just wayyyy overthinking the whole stuff?",1522706707,4/2/2018 17:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/895pss/request_how_to_approach_the_dietitian/,2

Two years ago, I began recovering after nearly four years of suffering from ARFID. Since then (and to this day), I have struggled quite a bit with the associated weight gain that comes with having an unrestricted diet as well as diminished self-esteem and body-image issues. Every now and then I take drastic measures to try to restrict my diet but it only makes the situation worse as I binge to compensate.

74,88hp55,Request: looking for advice on telling my SO about my ED,"I’ve had an eating disorder for most of my life, I’ve also been single for most of my life, so I’ve pretty much never told anyone. My parents know I have issues with food, so do my friends, but no one knows the extent.

I recovered a couple of years ago and I’ve been doing really well since then. I started dating my boyfriend about a year ago and I was never planning to tell him about my food issues because it was all in the past. And then I relapsed.

I love my boyfriend and I don’t like hiding stuff from him so I want to tell him, but like I said, I’ve never told anyone. With my family it’s always just been “food issues” and “control issues” but never “eating disorder”.

I’m scared to tell my boyfriend because I still eat a decent amount some days, usually just to keep people from being suspicious but also because some days I just feel like I can handle it, and I don’t want to tell him just for him to say “well you seem fine to me”. I also don’t want to tell him and have him start trying to make me eat. It’s also terrifying just thinking of telling anyone this thing that I’ve kept to myself for so long. I really don’t want him telling my parents, but I don’t think he would do that.

So to all the people out there who have told their SO’s about their eating disorders, how did it go? Do you regret it? Do you recommend it? I’m really scared but I think I should tell him and I don’t know what to do.",1522490202,3/31/2018 4:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/88hp55/request_looking_for_advice_on_telling_my_so_about/,2

I've been struggling with anorexia b/p subtype and bulimia for a few years now. Did inpatient twice. The second time was the most painful thing I have ever experienced. The drive to binge/purge was so violently intense and I felt like a desperate caged animal. Things rapidly got bad again when I returned home.

When I'm not eating, I feel incredibly stressed and anxious. I can't concentrate, nothing feels good in my life, and I can't get any work done. When I start eating, I'm like a tornado that can't be stopped. But at least, for those moments, I'm focused and content.

79,884a5j,Request: Eating disorder recovery and aspergers,"A couple weeks ago I left the eating disorder treatment facility that I was at because I felt that I had gotten everything I could from the program. I got my health under control and developed more regular eating habits. I left before my team recommended for me to leave because I felt that there was something that was going to be different about my recovery than what they wanted. I have not yet been officially diagnosed with ASD but have been told to seek out a diagnosis by my treatment team and I know that it runs in my family.

Some of the things that are maybe seen as ""eating disorder behaviors"" that definitely can be but that I'm not sure have to be if they are more driven by ASD:

I really need routine. Eating the same foods every day helps to ease my anxiety and as long as I'm feeding my body adequate nutrition then I believe a food routine is fine. Routine is often frowned upon in eating disorder treatment because it is seen as a way of controlling your food intake in an ""eating disordered"" way, which (from my own personal experience) it definitely can be.

Exercise. I started exercising again, but not too much. Just enough to expel some of the nervous energy that I constantly have. It helps me. I kept telling my treatment team that, but it is pretty standard to cut out exercise for a period of time while in recovery. I just NEED movement and I believe this is some sort of stimming behavior.

Eating rituals. If I have to use a certain type of utensil to eat certain foods or if I take bites in a certain pattern, then how does that affect my health? It really doesn't. If I'm eating, I'm eating, it doesn't matter how the food gets into my body so please stop telling me that these are ""behaviors"" that I shouldn't engage in.

Counting calories. This goes back to the food routine and eating the same thing every day. If I know how much I'm eating then I feel more confident in whether I've eaten too little, too much, or just the right amount. My hunger signals don't quite work that well. If I need food, I may not know it and I'll think that I'll just wait until I'm REALLY hungry to eat because food is a whole lot better when you actually feel really hungry. If I've eaten enough and need to stop, I also may not know it because I like the sensation of eating certain foods and my brain doesn't communicate well with my gut.

At my doctor check-up today I finally confronted my doctor about my speculation of being on the spectrum. She expressed that she wondered why she hadn't considered this before. I just want to know that I'm not crazy and that a lot of the things I do with food are because of ASD and don't have to be connected to my eating disorder. This means so much for my recovery and I hope that other people who might be in my same situation can seek this same understanding of their brains.

80,8847rj,Request: possible EDNOS and just looking for some support,"I think I have some problems with food and I’ve never shared most of this with anyone. I’ve had therapy in the past but didn’t get near the food issues. I could potentially access eight free therapy sessions through my EAP at work and may eventually call and ask for help with this. But I’m not ready for that yet and I really just want to share this and not feel alone with it all.

I tried emailing a helpline about a few of my feelings and the reply just focused on asking if I was getting treatment for my eating disorder - basically they came on way too strong. I really just want some more gentle support.

Some background: I have a bad history with food due to childhood neglect. There were times when I wasn’t fed properly and I also used to have pica which can be associated with childhood malnutrition. My father was horrible to me and would yell at me for being ungrateful if I didn’t eat the food I was given. Also his table manners were disgusting and when I eat I worry that I am disgusting like him. But I got into the habit of eating fast because I wanted to get away from meal times as quickly as possible or because I was hungry.

I eat very quickly and cannot seem to slow down. I do not want advice on how to do this. What I need is to feel like it is okay if I eat and eating does not make me disgusting even if I do it quickly.

When someone comments on what I eat or implies that I ate fast it creates a shame spiral that can last for a long time. Even when I try eat slowly I still finish first. Even when I think I’m eating slowly it turns out I’m not. Again I don’t want advice on how to eat more slowly - this is not helpful and thank you for respecting this.

When I hear about people restricting I think I am so disgusting and they would judge me.

I actually do eat food, I just don’t feel ok about it.

I get really stressed when people ask what I am eating or look at my food.

Recently I met up with someone I used to know through work as she was at a conference in my local area and she said she was so bad as she ate lots of the free food. I was like: aren’t you meant to eat the food, and she was going on and on about how she normally brings food from home and it made me feel like I was a terrible person for enjoying food at conferences and I had to ask her to stop as food shaming isn’t helpful at all.

I know all of this is irrational but I can’t shake it. I really just want some support. Thank you.

I have went through a lot of abusive situations related to food, mostly caused by my family. It is all one big interconnected snowball. I have depression, social anxiety, borderline and PTSD caused by my abusive family. They always pound me on not eating enough, and being unhealthy. I am biologically male, but I am gender-noncomforming. I constantly have a voice ""You don't eat enough"" hovering above me. My family thinks that I am lazy, when really I have suicidal thoughts and depression from one physically abusive situation where I called the police. All this happened because I didn't climb a rock properly. I always get lectures when I eat.

I hate food because I associate it with abuse and my own life story. I think I am on the verge of developing anorexia because of this, and I often eat junk food just to fill the number of calories a ""teenage boy needs to eat through the day"".

84,8b6eat,Request: How can I help my sister who I think has exercise bulimia?,"I think my sister has exercise bulimia. She lost a fair amount of weight when starting a new job at a hospital, and while I would say she's still at a normal weight (but the low end of normal), I am worried she has disordered patterns with food and exercise.

She wears a Fitbit and regularly averages 15K steps per day and recently that has increased to 25K. She has said things like ""I feel like I can't not hit my goal"" and ""I can't remember the last time I didn't hit my goal."" She jobs around the house if she wants to get some more steps and she recently told me she did a 2 hour run inside her house during a snowstorm (not on a treadmill - running back and forth from the front to the back of her house) because that was the length listed in her training program that day.

She also logs her food on MFP and recently I've noticed a pattern of possible binging. It seems like a convoluted process, but she told me once that when she is in excess of her net goal, she will log the excess onto the next day to remind herself to eat less that day. That doesn't seem like a red flag in and of itself but recently she appears to be binging and exercising more so that she's never over her calorie goal. For example the past week has had a ton of Easter candy with a ton of extra exercise. I'm talking thousands of extra calories of movement (above and beyond her workout) to counteract a ton of candy. Meanwhile her calories from regular food (not candy or snacks) is quite low. Meanwhile she has pushed even more Easter candy to the future. For tomorrow she has many thousands of calories of Easter candy logged - I can only assume this is candy she has already eaten and plans to burn off?? Before the Easter candy it looks like she was eating hundreds of calories of trail mix per day and exercising it off.

I can tell from her Fitbit profile that she regularly gets the majority of her steps late at night (between 10PM and midnight). This might make sense for certain careers, but she works in the health care profession during the day and she has told me her numbers are high because she walks a lot at work. I think she's jogging around her house late at night to burn off what she eats during the day.

I am worried about her. She lives in another city from me and the rest of our family so I can't help her in person. I've tried mentioning it to her before but she gets defensive or acts like it's not a big deal. My other sister and I are talking to our mom about it tonight.

We live together, but I have trouble making sure that she eats well, or at all. I know that her eating disorder is due in part because her parents would more or less force-feed her when she was a child (her other mental health problems stem from her parents as well), so I don't want to make her feel like I'm being too insistent on her eating. But I'm not sure what to do. She stays up very late (3am or later) and wakes up around 2-3pm. She will often check her phone for an hour or so, and then go back to sleep until 6-7pm. I imagine that she sleeps so much because of her eating disorder, but I don't really know how I can best support her. Usually, when I ask if she wants to eat anything, she just shakes her head and goes back to sleep. By the time I am eating dinner, though, she will usually eat normally for that one meal.

It wasn't until I gained 80 pounds from pregnancy bedrest and got into a really abusive relationship where my weight was constantly commented on and made fun of that I started having issues. Recently I have been wanting to take my body back. I know I have an eating disorder, but because I am a big girl, everyone thinks that I have bulimia and most constantly stuff my face.

I don't.

In fact, I often go more than 20 hours between meals. I do not binge then. I eat a meal, until full. Most often something quick and easy, like pasta or some such that doesn't require me to think ""oh that would be good with that, or let's add this. yum"". Yes, food tastes good but I can't get past this mindset that if I eat, I will get fatter.

Like I said, I am taking my body back. For the last week I have been eating 2-3 meals a day and have switched to low carb. I worry about getting addicted to working out or still feeling fat once I get to my goal weight, but I feel like knowing what I suffer from better.....would just be a big help. My brain already knows that eating won't actually make me bigger. Doctors have even told me that the reason I haven't been able to lose weight till this point, is because my body is in constant starvation mode and thus storing it's reserves as fat. Which I know is science. But my brain just doesn't want to believe it because I see others with the disorder I believe I have, that are thin. Maybe it's because I am already big. I don't know, but even I can't escape the ""Can't be that because then you'd not be fat"".

I am just frustrated and want some answers and any doctor I've seen just diagnose me as an unclassified eating disorder and suggest I join weight watchers. Please give me your thoughts.",1523233281,4/8/2018 19:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8auck3/request_am_i_anorexic/,2

95,8d0im5,"Research recruitment - Societal discourse on eating disorders, including stereotypes/misconceptions","Hello everyone! 

I'm currently a freshman in college, and for my first year writing class, I'm working on a project that looks at eating disorders and how they are viewed by society. In order to gain some insight on this topic, I'm conducting a survey that asks participants to answer questions about their knowledge and conceptions about eating disorders. Anyone aged 14 or older is eligible to participate; you don't need any extensive background knowledge about eating disorders. The survey is completely anonymous, and you can withdraw at any time. 

The final project will not be published anywhere, and will be seen only by myself and my professor, who you can email with any questions at amy.jamieson@mail.rit.edu.

The survey should only take 5-10 minutes to complete. Thank you in advance for your participation!

96,8cmaip,Request: Should calories matter at all during recovery?,"So I've recently spoken to a dietitian about my recovery and I've been given an exchange-based meal plan to follow but that's just about it. I'm kinda concerned given that recovery guidelines typically have calorie intake minimums (e.g. MinnieMaud) but I wasn't really given one? I tried calculating the calories for today (I know it's bad, but it wasn't ED-fueled) and I got to a number that's a bit above maintenance.

I was wondering if this is okay for recovery given that I'm within the ""healthy"" weight range or if I should eat more for my body to repair fully (get my period back, speed up my metabolism, etc.).

97,8ckdug,Request: I think I may have an ED. Help.,"Hi, I'm a girl in college. I am currently on the low side of normal BMI, and I am mostly happy with my weight, but I am a big perfectionist and just want to lose a bit of a muffin top I have. To do that I have begun subconsciously counting my calories, and I feel really bad if I eat something ""unhealthy"".

This has begun to occupy me quite a bit (I can't say if this is a lot because it seems normal but simultaneously it doesn't). I always calculate what I should put in my salad to get the max amount of nutrients, and I'm consciously skipping meals if it's too late. I don't know if this counts as restricting, but I'm eating a lot less than I am used to and feel good about it. My relationship with food has turned strange--On one hand, I really feel different and confident with my new ""diet""; on the other, I really hate how I'm dedicating so much time to think about what nutrients my food contains instead of just enjoying it.

What's scaring me is how closely I'm beginning to resemble an ED patient. I am currently sitting here at 10 PM, having not had anything since for dinner aside from a cookie at around 6, with my stomach growling and my brain battling between eating something and ""controlling myself"". I have not purged, yet, but the thought is crossing my mind more frequently, and I don't like it. I'm also a big perfectionist, which is a high-risk factor for ED.

I'm training to become a healthcare professional, I know how devastating EDs are. I want to curb this before it gets worse, but I really would prefer to not go to a therapist if I have to option to not to because that might show up on my transcript, which could stain my resume for application to graduate schools.

If you guys can help me I would really, really appreciate it.

101,8chdom,Request: I think I’m developing a eating disorder 19M,"I’m 19 Male, thin, but not clinically underweight. I don’t have much experience about eating disorders so maybe this is nothing but, I feel like something isn’t right.

Basically I’m gay and I wanna be a twink, so I compare my body to unhealthy instagram models. So I decided I wanna be like a guy there. Reason I wanna do this is cause I been “on the edge” my whole life with everything. So context to this it means I don’t wanna be a 3/10 twink I wanna be a 10/10 twink. Where ppl tells me “omg u so hot” etc. I know this is a really bad way of building self esteem etc but yea.

To the point, I started to eat healthy cause the way I learned it is if u wanna lose body fat u have to either eat less and exercise little. Or exercise a lot and eat a lot. I went with the first pick. I avoid eating any sweets, candy, soda etc. I never eat it cause I don’t feel a need for it. The way I see it, it’s that it’s unneeded kcals. My parents tells me “u know it’s okay to eat unhealthy sometimes and u don’t have to drink water only” etc.

I’m scared cause yesterday I woke up being dizzy and stuff so I couldn’t/didn’t wanna eat. The dizziness has nothing to do with this but however, i got thoughts in my head “maybe I shouldn’t eat that much lunch and try delay it now when the clock is already 3PM it’s only 2 hours till dinner”. (First time I got these thoughts, cause the day before a guy told me “if u scared getting hungry at night u can eat less at lunch/dinner and eat a little on the night” I think that was the trigger.

I googled eating disorder and got a little scared that this is a sign of DEVELOPING a eating disorder. I went to my weight today. I've lost weight since yesterday. I felt hungry the whole day yesterday idk why, I did have a extra glass of yoghurt right before I fell asleep so I wouldn’t be so hungry. (I couldn’t tell if I was actually hungry, if I knew I was hungry I would have ate a 100%) but yea.

How do I stop this? I don’t wanna get a eating disorder, cause I don’t feel like I need a cheat day to eat candy etc etc. But every time I do eat something unhealthy even if it’s just raspberry jam on my oatmeal I feel super bad for it. That cannot be healthy.

I do daily powerwalks right now but I gonna start running next week. But I just wanna cry right now cause every time I try to do something on my own it always end up being bad. Like since this is how I learned, how u get fit, u eat healthy. But I used to be able to eat candy and stuff without feeling bad at all for it, I’m already kinda “small” I have a normal waist size, but I want a flatter stomach. I’m just scared this isn’t a good and healthy mindset. Idk what to do :(

How do I deal with this?",1523819148,4/15/2018 14:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8chdom/request_i_think_im_developing_a_eating_disorder/,3
102,8chcd2,Request: Roommates in recovery can hear our other roommate purging. Help.,"My best friend/roommate, who I'll call Amy, has been hearing our other roommate, who I'll call Sara, purging with increased loudness in our bathroom just about every night or so. We have been certain that this has been happening for at least the last month or two. Amy has been the one hearing it most often as her room is the closest to the bathroom. I heard it for the first time tonight and it was incredibly jarring.

Amy and I are both recovering from our disordered eating. Amy has not been diagnosed with anything but tends to restrict and I was diagnosed with bulimia due to binge/purging. As you can imagine, hearing Sara's purges is extremely triggering to both of us.

For me, it is simply because I also purged in a similar fashion. Additionally (pardon the explicitness), I am the only roommate who has been cleaning the bathroom and have noticed on several occasions mess that is indicative of purging. Every time I have to clean the toilet I dread the flashbacks of cleaning up my own vomit.

For Amy it has more to do with some kind of competitiveness (though I think over boys, not eating) that Sara was for a while vocal about participating in against Amy. I have tried to remind Amy that this very likely has nothing to do with Sara competing with them in any way. Of course, however, having to hear their purges is beginning to really get to them.

We are not sure how to handle this situation. Amy and Sara have a friendship, but still Amy is nervous to even bring this up to Sara. I am not really friends with Sara, but probably have more in common with her due to our similar ED behavior. If we were to talk to her, who would it be better coming from? I truly understand the horror of being ""called out"" but I have no idea what to do other than bring it up with them. Just wait it out and let it happen because it's not my business and suffer in the meantime?

I feel pretty disrespected, used, and just generally unsafe. I don't know how much longer I can live in this kind of environment. If I had known this was something I would be exposed to, I would not have agreed to this living arrangement. Our lease is up in 4 months.

TLDR: My roommate and I are both recovering from ED. How can we address our roommate's frequent audible purging, if at all?",1523818857,4/15/2018 14:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8chcd2/request_roommates_in_recovery_can_hear_our_other/,9

106,8byt6h,Request: Need advice for bulimia treatment,"I am in my late 30s and have suffered from bulimia since college. In college, I went through a very intensive period of BP for about 1-2 years. I eventually made a partial recovery and for the past 20 years I have mostly been a regular eater, but in times of great stress or anxiety I relapse for a few months. After my most recent relapse I decided that I want to get treated and stop doing this for good. I am looking into therapists and would like some advice as to how best to treat this.

I have been going to therapy for about 4 years in previous cities that I lived in. Those therapists knew about my bulimia past but didn’t know about my relapses which I kept secret. Now I have recently moved to a new city and would like to get a new therapist specifically for treating this issue but also as a long term general therapist. I found someone who is a general therapist for anxiety, depression, etc. She lists eating disorders as one of the things she treats. I haven’t met her yet but am hoping to set up an appointment soon.

108,8byska,"Request: Not sure how to even begin recovery, nobody takes my EDNOS seriously","I've dealt with disordered eating for a long time, probably going on 8 years now? I have always been clinically overweight, and without being too specific, it's gotten really bad. But the thing is, I have never had issues with binge eating! I've always been food-avoidant, and people always seemed to act like it was a good thing. I've talked to every therapist I've seen about it, my primary care doctor, even a nutritionist! They just don't seem to ever pay any attention to it. I don't know if they think I'm lying, or if restricting intake is what they think will ""fix"" my lifelong weight problems, but it's a maladaptive behavior that causes me significant undue stress. And there are some physical side effects to my eating habits too, and of course these are ignored.

I don't want to be too specific in order to avoid triggering people, but basically eating is a chore for me. Almost a punishment. On my bad days, I might eat one small snack, or spend the whole day in a low sugar crash. On my better days, I might manage two smallish meals, and labor through the process of eating them. I almost never overeat, never binge, but my stomach is always wrecked and I'm constantly in the bathroom.

I don't know what to do. I've sought help! I've told people that I'm struggling, and laid bare my highly emotional fight just to keep myself functional, but I feel like it's never taken seriously and no one has bothered to help me with coping strategies no matter how much I bring it up.

112,8bp6o2,Request: Question / Need help - Anorexia and the girl that I love,"Hey, I have some questions if I'm doing right and if I'm helping properly. So like 3 years ago I've met this awesome girl in a dating messenger. She‘s 20 now btw (I‘m 25) and was looking quite normal and not too skinny. First we were writing a lot and it quickly became daily. Then I got her phone number, uninstalled the dating app that I didn‘t need anymore and we messaged each other almost daily. This was going on for like 2 years until we met for out first date about 6 months ago at my home. I knew before our first date that she had anorexia a few years ago bc she told me about it and she told me that she‘s over it. At our first date she literally blew my mind, she is such a sweetheart and a really kind person. Yes I was thinking she is a little too skinny but her positive sides and her positive attitudes were exceeding that by far. So we came closer to each other and quickly had our second date. We were kissing and cuddling all day and were just happy to have each other. But then the horror started... She had a relapse that had nothing to do with me (she told me that). She was talking to me openly about it and told me that I'm the only one she's trusting atm and who she's talking to atm and that her anorexia is back and that she has problems again and don't want to talk with her parents / therapist / doctor about it so that I'm the only one who's knowing what's really going on with her. She was loosing weight so quickly and for me it was the pure nightmare. As usual with anorexia she wasn't listening to things I said like that she should look for help, visit the doctor and so on. She was also provoking stress and little discussions / fights with me so that she had arguments why to not meet me me for the 3rd date. This was really hard for me and a really tough time bc i already developed serious feelings for her. You want to help so much but you simply can't and are just helpless if she doesn't want to get help. That was so hard to accept for me at first. But somehow she agreed to the 3rd date after a few weeks. This was special bc at this time I knew whats going on and could see how skinny she got and so I didn't talk about food or try to convince her to eat more or something while hanging and just tried to be there for her. The day ended in eating a few spoons of ice cram with me and again kissing and cuddling all day but the weeks after the date she still didn't listen to me to get help. But after her 4th or 5th collapse after passing out and landing in the hospital she couldn't keep it for her anymore, her friends recognized, also her family und I was close before needing a talk to a therapist as well bc I felt so helpless and depressed and was worrying so much. That's when she listend to me and a few of her best friends and her doctor and agreed to go to a special clinic for 2 months. That's were she is atm for recovery and she is allowed to still message me daily and has her phone back (first weeks in clinic she wasn't allowed to use her phone). She is gaining weight there but still thinks she's loosing control over her body if she's gaining more weight... She has 1 month behind her and has 1 month left to go and has bis fears that it‘s getting worse again quickly after she is back from clinic.

Can some of you help me with informations how i can help and be there for her the best way? I already informed me about this illness and about the consequences and that it can be really hard for a boyfriend (potential boyfried in my case) and that you‘ve to give so much more energy to the relationship and then you can get back little to nothing and that it‘s not easy and probably will never be. I‘m aware of all of this but that‘s ok I decided that I can live with that and that she‘s definitely worth it. And I already openly told her about it, that I‘m 100% sure that I‘m still interested in her and still want to help and still want a relationship with her if she‘s willing to and if the future is holding that for us and that I give her all the time of the world that she needs and that WE can get trough this if she‘s accepting my help. That she‘s not alone and that she can beat this f*cking nightmare of an illness and that I'm really proud of her for fighting against it. We now agreed that we‘ll continue to message each other daily and have our 4th date after she‘s back from clinic and that we‘ll see what the future is holding for us then.

Am I doing right? Bc I don‘t want to make it worse or don‘t want to cause more struggles. Any useful ideas what to do and what I better shouldn‘t do or say to her? I really want to help her and want to protect her from another relapse after she‘s back from clinic the best way that I can and that she‘s allowing me to do.

At the end of my story let me say that I think that all of you who have an ED and are helping each other here are true heroes imo for talking openly about it and staying strong and trying to beat this nightmare. Keep fighting the good fight! I‘d be very thankful about any thoughts and feedback about my story.

114,8etezs,Post request: Is this a problem?,"I have been doing intermittent fasting (longest 48hrs so far) and increasing the frequency and lengths of fasts. My husband sometimes says to me ""I hope you're not getting an eating disorder"". Now I don't think I am - I am morbidly obese - and also in the past one of the reasons I have given up on a ""weight loss journey"" (god that phrase makes me feel ill) is because first I feel like I am not losing weight fast enough or that I have stalled out and so need less calories or whatever and then eventually I worry I am being too ""extreme"" and use the fear of developing an eating disorder as an excuse to stop trying to lose weight and eat everything in sight.

So I am wary of this, and I know it's common that people get nervous when you're losing weight because change is scary. BUT I do find myself doing stupid things. Like I do make myself competitive about calories or fasting or whatever - with myself, not anyone else, because obviously I couldn't exactly compete with other people given how much I had to eat to get as fat as I am. I admit I do read those pro-ana blogs and look at thinspiration (even though I am a grown woman and that feels ridiculous) but not really because I want it for inspiration, I know I am too fat for any of it to even be meaningful to me, like it's literally worlds away from anything I could ever imagine, but I just find it interesting and like the aesthetic of it all even though it's very much ""something I could never have"" (and nor would I really want to because I like having energy and hair and teeth and all that jazz). When I was pregnant with my sons I did totally abuse pregnancy nausea once or twice when I overate junk food (which was all I could stomach) to ...remove the junk food. I was very worried about gaining too much weight during pregnancy and I did manage to avoid any gain in my first pregnancy and kept it under 10lbs in the second pregnancy. I totally obsess with calories and food when I am on a weight loss phase, I will ignore my kid requesting to read a book so I can read articles about weight loss or stupid magic food I know won't actually achieve anything or studies about different diets or whatever. I feel like lower is always better, faster is always better, I can worry about being sustainable when I am thin but for now I have to get rid of all this fat because I hate that the world can see, physically on my body, what a lazy glutton I've been - and I hate that I've been working hard and lost so much weight that it's still invisible to everyone and I look just like anyone else who eats too much and sits on their arse all day. Like I don't care so much about beautiful anymore, especially because I am getting older and once I lose weight I will basically have a dress of loose skin, but I don't want to visibly display my vices to the world on my body. I don't want to be the kind of person who if I say ""oh I love food"" the other person will be able to respond ""yeah that's obvious!""

What made me want to write this post is, well I am fasting today, and my son was feeding me his dinner (he ate a lot earlier so it's not a big deal) and I obviously wanted to reward his generosity not throw it back in his face, then I went to the bathroom and spat out the food he gave me. I thought, gee that's kind of f-ed up, but at the same time I worry if I'd have swallowed it I'd have lost resolve for the day and then eaten too much and not made any progress. I have an app that makes a trend of your weight and even though I lost basically half a kilo the past couple of weeks because I was losing so fast before (3-4kg a week) it looks like my weight has been stable on the trend graph and it's like... I need to get it going back down again so I can feel like I will eventually get to the point where I am not just the fat woman. Where people won't know how weak and lacking in self control I am just by looking at me.

115,8eteh3,Request: Need advice on helping a loved one,"My girlfriend of 3 months who is at a perfectly healthy and positive weight) we were good friends for a while before that) has had a recent uptick in the last couple of weeks in erratic behaviour involving food and I don’t know how to deal with it. It started with her feeling guilty sometimes when she ate certain foods, but that went on for a while, then she stopped eating breakfast all together even though she ate things like fruit for breakfast before that. (no big meals) Then even more recently, she has become a bit more body conscious and started feeling more guilty every time she eats. Then in the last week or so she had a sudden fall deeper to the point where she doesn’t want to eat at all anymore unless she needs to. This is when I confronted her and told her she may be anorexic (she fits every behavioural symptom) or something else and she needs help from someone even though she hates therapy. She understood what I was saying but she doesn’t want to get help whatsoever. Also lately she has an urge to starve until she faints. She also has an obsession with wanting to lose weight. (Which really sucks because I love her body type and how she looks and she is perfectly healthy and on the skinnier side already) Some days she is better and she will eat a small amount on her own accord but that is rare. She only really eats when someone makes her. She plays contact sports everyday and she went the entire day without eating yesterday. I am very worried about her and I don’t know how to deal with her besides what I have been doing which is reassuring her and telling her she should get help from her mom even though her mom didn’t listen in the past when she said something about maybe having an eating disorder. I have serious anxiety so this really makes me stressed out and I just really want her to feel better more importantly. Please note she is extremely nervous about her mom knowing about anything because she hasn’t helped much in the past and because her mom has been part of the problem (saying things such as “we are the same size” and then saying she hates her own weight in different circumstances) and since she isn’t 16 yet she can’t get medical help or anything without her parents knowledge. What can I or she do to help her before this gets out of hand?

Also she used to obsessively weigh herself in mid high as she was a little overweight as an elementary school student and she stopped which made her feel better for a while and she hasnt stepped on a scale in years. Also she told me she had thought about eating and throwing up in the past to eat but keep her weight but she doesnt like food in general. She also has a problem with eating in public

117,8egr0r,Request: Seeking advice for 13 year old daughter,"My teen has suffered a lot of loss recently and is in therapy.

When someone in our family passes, she stops eating or skips meals.

She has recently started telling me she is fat, has started reading labels, and will only eat food under 100 calories but in excess.

She confessed to me she wanted to start eating healthier so I went out and immediately stocked the fridge with oranges (her favorite), vegetables, and lean meats.

She has ignored all the food I bought her and instead will eat a piece of bread for breakfast, bread for lunch, and 5 cheesesticks for dinner. I told her the oranges are for her and she said they have ""too much sugar"". I explained how bread converts into sugar and had a long conversation about this with her. She now will eat bread at every meal we sit down at while I cook a full meal and eat right next to her.

Tonight, she counted out 20 Pringles she bought at her dad's and ate that for dinner. I feel she is doing it for attention because it upsets me to see her ignore my home cooked meals.

After 9pm she will sneak applesauce or cheesesticks and I find wrappers everywhere.

There is no candy or pop in the house. She will not purge as she is petrified of throwing up.

However, after she eats she does over 300 situps and pushups alone in her room. She constantly tells me she is ""fat"" and seeks the reassurance of me saying ""no you are not"". If I do not tell her she is of normal weight, she exercises more.

118,8eehcr,"Request: I Know This Mentality is Dumb, but I Can't Stop. I Need Help","Journal entry 1:10 AM Tuesday, April 24, 2018 I keep justifying it to myself that having enough food is just a luxury and that being hungry, just a little, won't kill me because I'm still eating, just maybe not as much as I should. I'm not anorexic or anything because it's not like I choose not to eat because I'm trying to lose weight. I don't always eat enough because food is expensive, I'm trying to save money, and it's not gonna kill me just to be a little hungry. There are poor people all over the world who don't get enough food. I know all of this is ridiculous, but I just can't stop. Even now, I'm hungry, but I don't want to go downstairs [to the store] to spend money. [boyfriend] hit the nail on the head this weekend by suggesting I can't save as much money as I do and eat too, and I told him I just cook my own meals, and that's how I save money. I was too embarrassed to tell him he was right because I KNOW it's stupid, I just can't seem to stop doing it. I'm so focused on saving money that I view being full as a luxury even though I technically can afford to eat enough. In February, I didn't pay attention to my budget and just bought food when I was hungry and ate until I was full, but that caused me so much anxiety when I checked my account balance because I had spent WAY more on food than I usually did, and it caused me to have an even stricter budget the next month, leading to more nights of trying to go to bed early so I won't have to feel hungry and trying to convince myself that the free chocolate I get at work is a meal. I justify it by thinking that I eat enough on the weekends, and I still get my period, my hair isn't falling out, and I don't look like a skeleton, so it can't be too bad, right? I KNOW MY WAY OF THINKING IS DUMB AND THAT IT'S HURTING MY BODY, BUT STOPPING DOESN'T EVEN FEEL LIKE AN OPTION. Spending that much money gives me anxiety. I feel like the only person I can talk about this with is [friend], and even she may not fully understand. I don't want to confess to [boyfriend] that this is a problem because he'll make me feel stupid. The solution seems so obvious but feels so unattainable. I need help but at the same time don't want it because I don't want to spend the money on the help and don't want to stop saving so much money that I'll need in he future. Is money really worth my health? No. So why can't I stop this ridiculous cycle?",1524513861,4/23/2018 15:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8eehcr/request_i_know_this_mentality_is_dumb_but_i_cant/,3

I'm not having any disordered thoughts about my body. I have a therapist and she helps a lot with my anxiety and OCD but doesn't know anything about ARFID, just anorexia, bulimia and binge eating.

123,8e2bwl,Request: How can I be strategic with meal frequency?,"I have been recovering from restrictive anorexia for 1.5 - 2 years. Despite fostering greater comfort with food types, I believe that I relate consumption to accomplishment or productivity measures and let too much time pass before eating. Surely if I've gone too long with too little food I feel more stressed and am either less open to choices or spend a lot of time cooking.

I typically get to my breakfast pretty soon in the mornings but it can be tough to have lunch at a reasonable hour, in which case I am even less inclined to start on dinner.

Can this situation be improved with a schedule, e.g. set times for main meals and possibly snacks? Should I concentrate on eating a small dish every 3 hours (give or take)? How can I reframe the ""I need to finish this first"" perspective?

125,8duvzp,Request: Should I tell my parents about my sister's eating disorder?,"I recently found out through my sister's tumblr that she appears to be suffering from anorexia nervosa. I only found her tumblr out of curiosity, because in previous conversations she had joked about never showing it to me/letting me follow her. I decided to look for it since I thought I'd only find silly stuff like fanfiction and the like, but instead found really depressing things. She isn't aware that I've seen it.

Her tumblr is filled with reblogs tagged as ""thin inspiration"", reblogs about fasting and mental struggles with food, reblogs about being severely depressed about her eating disorder and being fat (she is most definitely not), and even reblogs about suicidal thoughts and not being able to continue with life. She's convinced she'll never find love because of her appearance, and also glorifies being at an unhealthy weight. It's all incredibly distressing, and I'm very concerned for her mental and physical health.

I'd like to confront her to tell her she's loved, and that she can talk to me, and to encourage her to meet with a therapist (from her posts, she's very much aware she has problem and doesn't like it,) but I'm worried I'll upset her and drive her away. I'm worried she will do something bad after finding out that I know about her eating disorder. Me finding her tumblr was a huge invasion of her privacy and I'm sorry I did that. I'm really worried that telling her I found it will break the trust in our relationship. If I do confront her, I'll only be able to do it in the next following days, as we'll be spending our summers apart. She will be living alone for a month and a half until our roommate comes back from a trip in mid-June.

If I don't confront her, I'll be stuck with this secret, and she will most likely continue with her eating disorder/mental health problems, which could deteriorate. I'm worried about her health, and I think my parents should be made aware, but I don't want to tell them behind her back, as this will be another breach of trust between us.

I don't know how to go about this. Do I confront her (although I won't be able to see her in person for the rest of the summer)? Do I tell my parents? Do I tell my parents after confronting her? Do I only confront her after the summer?

I've cried a lot since I've found her tumblr. It's really heart-breaking to see her hate herself so much, and I want to help her as best as I can.

128,8gg4m6,Request: Have you tried explaining your ED to someone who can’t understand it?,"I’m recovered from my bulimia/BED, but some weird habits still linger, such as being triggered by boredom and hunger and literally having to eat in that moment, like I can’t think of anything else besides eating and I become incredibly anxious. Being recovered, I won’t feel the need to binge or purge, but if I don’t eat something I’ll just become saturated in this weird mental state.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year (been recovered since we met). My boyfriend is effortlessly in great shape, has a great metabolism, eats whatever the hell he wants and knows pretty much nothing about nutrition (where I could tell you literally everything about a certain food). My boyfriend will drink three canned lemonades in a row and I’m sitting there thinking....I can’t even imagine doing that. Lol

He knows I used to have my disorders, but I feel like he can’t really grasp them. The other day when his mom and sister were in, I was hungry...where most people would have just waited, I had that obsessive feeling to go out and eat. So I left and went and got myself a sandwich. When I came back later and they were all eating spaghetti together, we talked outside for a minute. He seemed a little turned off or confused by it, and when I tried to explain he said “I eat when I get bored too”. I was hurt by that, just because he’s missing the point. He tried to comfort me after that, it’s like he wants to get it but he can’t.

Anyways, it’s not a big deal at all anymore since I’m recovered, but when little things pop up, I’ll keep them to myself.

129,8g557u,Request: Need help for a friend,"Hello everyone!

Tl;dr: I want to help a female friend who has anorexia, she's 25 and will finish college this year. I've had some eating problems, but nothing as serious as her, and it was bulimia. We are not close friends, but have some intimacy. She doesn't think she is sick or need help, and it doesn't looks like she is getting any better soon by her own, and I can't sit down and watch her suffer and do nothing about it.

Long story: I will explain a little about myself and how I met this friend, because it may be useful to understand the situation and to help me approach this topic and help her. I will try to be concise:

About me:

I have OCD, I've been taking antidepressants for about a year now and it helped a lot not only with my OCD symptoms, but also with depression and other anxiety related problems, such as bulimia. My bulimia was never serious as other people from TV, I could and would eat healthy food and keep it in my stomach, it would only trigger when eating non-healthy food. Sometimes I would eat a whole box of chocolate and puke right after. It was really hard to control the eager to eat one chocolate after another, but it wasn't hard to not throw up after it, I could think straight, I clearly knew it wasn't good and that I shouldn't do it, but throwing up would make me feel a lot better than just having that inside me. I don't know exactly how to explain it, I'm not stupid, I was capable of seeing my weight and I knew I was the lightest adult male I know, I could see my bones in the mirror, but I just couldn't feel comfortable with my own body. I still struggle a little with it, but I'm a lot more in control now.
Anyway, bulimia is a lot different from anorexia. I don't know how people with severe anorexia feel about themselves. I don't know how they are capable of not eating, my problem is exactly the opposite, and as naive as I was, I admired the force of will of those who could simply not eat.

About my friend:

I met her for the first time at my third year in college, she was studying abroad and when she came back we started to attend to several classes together. We haven't really talked more than a good morning and had one or another conversation when hanging out with more people from our class. I had a light crush on her, as she seems to be a nice girl, but never committed because a friend of mine was hitting on her. One year and a half later, she told a common friend of us (close friend of mine, just a class friend of her) that she had been interested in me for the whole time since she got back, then he told me and we started to hang out for a very short time (something like two weeks). From my point of view we had a nice chemistry, but against my first impressions, we didn't match a lot. I was the one who got a kick in the butt btw, I really liked her, but there was a lot of things happening by the time and it just didn't work out. From that time on, we only talked a few times, we still have some common classes, but we rarely talk, I text her sometimes just to know if she is okay, what she is doing, etc. I didn't gave much attention to the signals of anorexia at the time because she tried to look like a ""normal eating person"" when we were together, and as I had suffered for eating disorders (bulimia), I actually admired her strong will for not eating (I know how that sounds retarded now). I only started to worry about her healthy some months later, as her illness became a lot more evident.
She has a lot of classmates-friends, some of them are mine as well, but that's the kind of friend that you interact daily, talk about Marvel movies and drink at parties, but not the truly kind of friend that you feel comfortable to talk about your feelings. She is very closed and doesn't talk about her personal stuff with anyone I know. Still, I tried to talk with some of the closest friends of her and they said that they have noted that she was getting worse and we started to think about what we could do to help her, we even created a WhatsApp group to discuss our next moves (lol).

Sadly, every time someone talks with her about her diet, she gets pissed and pushes the person away. We tried contacting her family, but they don't seem to care much and didn't gave us any feedback (they literally saw the messages and didn't care enough to reply a single word or emoji). Then, some months ago, I decided it was my time to talk to her directly, and she didn't get pissed with me, but she denied that she had anorexia, she said she was not even thin, and that she didn't thought that psychotherapy could be of any help. She also told me that she was a little scared of this kind of medication because a old friend of her got really bad after taking some for panic disorder meds. After it, I didn't know what to do, and waited to see if something would change, but she only got worse. Currently, she occupies most of her free time with exercises while eating the least possible.

So... why am I here? - The thing is, I don't want some generic wikihow article about eating disorder. I want to hear people who actually suffers from anorexia to be able to understand better how she feels and truly help her, not just give some random advices. I know I'm not a doctor, I'm not able to diagnose it, but I want to at least help her look for help. I struggled with OCD for my entire life and nothing people ever told me was ever useful. Usually I would be attacked about how strange, insane and idiot I was, and I only got treated when I realized myself that I was sick and that maybe I could be less miserable if I looked for help. /r/OCD played a big part on it, reading other people stories made me feel a lot less lonely and helped me decide to get help. So here I am at reddit again, and to be sincere, I am way more happy now. I used to think that taking meds would be a fake happiness, that I wouldn't be myself, but the truth is that even though I'm still fighting for it, now I can be the person I am truly am and go after the person I really wish to be, and I really want to help people around me who struggles with similar problems to overcome it too, specially related to anxiety, because I can relate a lot more to their pain.

Sorry for the long text and grammar mistakes, I needed a translator for some terms like the disorders names, but I think you'll be able to understand it. Thanks!",1525141942,4/30/2018 21:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8g557u/request_need_help_for_a_friend/,2
130,8g45zu,Request: Sport with weight classes,"I am looking for advice. After many years of disordered eating, I have recently (over the last year) made a lot of progress towards normalizing my food and weight. A big part of this was starting training Muay Thai about five months ago. It is a lot of fun and gave me something to focus on besides food. However, I am now getting to the level in Muay Thai where there starts to be the expectation to compete. I would really like to compete, but even if I lost 10 lbs, I would still likely be fighting people ~6 inches taller than me. I want to talk to the coach about it, but I don't think he would understand if I say that I can't diet down to a lower weight. I would really, really like to compete, and have been obsessing about this. Any ideas what to do? Thanks.

I wanted to clarify some things from my recent post request since I think it might help people give advice. I was trying to keep the post request short, but since I don't want to reply using this account, I want to provide more details:

First thing: I want to clarify that I am not using Muay Thai to overexercise. I used to have a problem with overexercise, but I actually just really enjoy the sport and train often (4 - 5 times a week) because I enjoy it. I am able to take days off without anxiety.

Second thing: I am well into the overweight BMI range. However, I have always had a very muscular build so my understanding (after a lot of hard work) is that I am actually a healthy and fairly lean weight for my body. I am just including this because I have had doctors give me a hard time for my BMI which was one of the original causes of my eating disorder so I am worried that the coach will say something similar.

Third thing: I am currently seeing a dietitian and she is the one that has helped me get out of my eating disorder. She is clear that I should not diet given my history, and when I have talked to her about Muay Thai, she says that I should fight at my current weight or not at all. However, since it's a combat sport, I worry that I could get hurt if I fought someone who had dieted down to my weight since they would be so much bigger (taller and stronger) than me.

Fourth: I do not have a scale and have been doing blind weigh-ins with my dietitian for the last six months since my weight is high enough that it triggers me to know the exact number. She tells me the general trends in my weight so I have a decent estimate.

As I write out the above information, it seems like I am not ready to fight since it would put so much focus on my weight. I want to reiterate though that I really want to compete. Everyone around me gets to do it, and it would be so satisfying to fully participate in the sport that I enjoy so much. If anyone has any ideas how I could participate while limiting the risk of relapsing, I would really appreciate it.

131,8fv63d,Request: Relapsed Again,"My first experience with this was 7 years ago. I struggled to recover for years, but I did it. I went through the process and the suffering and the pain and I did it, I recovered. I was able to live on my own, and still ate and I was so proud of myself. In the past year or so though, I’ve been slowly eating less and less. I didn’t do it intentionally, just reasoned with myself until not eating felt like the smart choice. Now after finally listening to the comments from my family, and stepping on a scale, I’ve realized that I’ve relapsed almost completely without even noticing.

I know that recovery is slow, and that relapses happen, but I already had my relapses years ago. I had my recovery years ago. I just want to move forward with my life, and instead am still stuck, suffering with this disease.

133,8furu2,Request: Motivating self to eat?,"over the past month or two, I have lost a not insignificant amount. I was not necessarily trying to lose this weight, but at meal times, I’ll often feel unmotivated to eat, or just not really care that I feel hungry. When I occasionally step on a scale and see that my weight has dropped I wonder how low I can get it, in a purposefully self destructive way, if that makes sense. Right now my BMI is underweight. I don’t even really like how my body looks when it’s this skinny, but there’s still this fear of gaining weight and incessant drive to keep losing it. I know it will probably start impacting my health soon, how do other people motivate themselves to eat?

135,8fot7w,Request: Male seeking advice,"Hello! Sorry to bother, I'll try and keep it as short as possible: I'm a young boy, I'm almost 22 and on the low side of the normal BMI range. That is not bad, I'm just slightly under my ideal weight, technically.

Point is: I've got here by losing more than 10kg on a rather deeply depressive period over the last few months. I'm confident that I'm really starting to get over it as of right now, so say the last couple of weeks?

However, I've developed some sort of phobia towards food. I have never actually been fat, I was just on the other side of the ""slightly over what I should be"" before getting here, so nothing more than a chubbier face and a little belly. Nothing I've ever been openly ashamed about, I just did not love the shape I was in, but neither I do now, after all, so.

I'm super scared that if I just relax a bit I could get back there, so I got to the point to which every morning I exercise for at least 15 minutes while I'm waiting for my breakfast to be ready, I memorised the number of calories of most of the food I consume and whenever I can I try and eat alone self prepared dishes so that I can make them avoiding all possible fats because I know that when I eat with my parents they'll use some, and I don't want to get to eat some I could avoid (talking extravirgin olive oil btw).

I usually eat a low number of calories for someone my size, and I consume all the caffeine my body can endure. As a result of this lifestyle I'm always anxious about my next meal, I feel dizzy and my muscles ache most of the time.

I want to stop it but I can't help but feel guilty whenever I eat something. My lunch consisted of brown bread, cured raw ham (with visible fat removed) and a tomato, and still I would feel super guilty about that.

I need somebody who tells me I'm getting stuff wrong, no matter how much I do it myself, the situation just does not get any better. It is not bearable anymore. 

Can anyone offer advice?",1524971534,4/28/2018 22:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8fot7w/request_male_seeking_advice/,2

139,8fgzjn,Request: How to recover my taste buds?,"I am of healthy weight but had experienced BN for well over 10 years and AN for the past 6 months. I purposely eat less and less and I am afraid this affected my tasting receptors. Food doesn't feel gross, not at all. But nothing is really really tasty like it used to be before. My favourite pizza, my home country's cuisine, meal in high end restaurant, drunk food. You get the point. I miss having tasty food and I am afraid all those years of purging and now starving did their damage.

Any advice, can I deal with it on my own or I need to see a specialist? If so, what specialist deals with that?

For clarification: It is not due to dental or hormonal problems - I do checks with my dentist and check my blood every 2 or 3 months. I've never had nasal or allergic problems and I believe it's not psychological - often I am too busy with work to get sad over it and only when I sit down to eat I realize the repetition of the situation.

140,8fad4h,Request: S/O trying to lose weight/get fit while I’m in recovery?,"I’ve (24F) been struggling with an ED for a few years now and just recently have made any progress at all recovering. My S/O (26M) and I have been together 9 months. He’s very supportive and has agreed with me that the diet industry and intentional weight loss is harmful and that diet culture is a huge social issue and part of why I have an ED.

A few days ago he admitted that he’s been trying to lose some weight intentionally. He started going to the gym again a few months ago - he said it was just for anxiety management purposes, as recommended by his therapist. But now pretty much all he ever does is fitness stuff and trying to lose the tiny amount of body fat on him (he’s already a thin, lean person, just has a tiny bit of tummy fat). He said it’s not a disordered thing and more just for fun as like a fitness goal and something to channel his focus into. And because he’s not in working right now, he doesn’t have a lot of other things to keep him busy.

I no longer feel like it’s a safe and supportive environment around him at this point. I feel like diet culture destroyed me and despite the fact that he knows all about it, he’s still choosing to engage with it and sees is as a benign thing. How am I supposed to be okay getting fatter and fatter every day, and not be allowed to exercise or work out while he’s getting fitter and leaner and considers it a high priority? How can I not interpret it as him finding diet/fitness important and just forgives me for not being able to work on it because I’m weak or inferior somehow? How can I not feel he’s a bit fatphobic when he doesn’t think it’s right to even have 4 or 5 extra pounds of fat on his body?",1524821623,4/27/2018 4:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8fad4h/request_so_trying_to_lose_weightget_fit_while_im/,11

144,8i2qlv,Request: I'm finally ready to get help but I don't know where to start,"For the last 4 years I've constantly been back and forth between restricting and binging. The last 6 months have been especially difficult. Long story short, I had two major surgeries where my abdomen was cut open and my intestines were rearranged and whatnot. Surgery recovery has been difficult mainly because I feel so awful about my stomach in particular, so I've been restricting quite bad. I have hypoglycemia, and a few weeks ago I ended up in the hospital due to hypoglycemic shock/near coma. I told myself I was gonna get this ED under control all on my own, that I would just start eating. Fast forward to last night, I was driving home, exhausted from a concert, when I went into shock again. I only had enough money to buy an orange juice (looking back I realize that was my mistake), and I crashed 10 minutes later. I had to sit in my car in a sketchy part of town for almost two hours, just so I could regain the mental cognitivity to drive home. I realize now that I absolutely do not have this under control, and I need help soon. I feel like I'm slowly killing myself, but for some reason I'm so scared to eat. My mom just brought me some food in bed, and I ate because I'm so tired of not having strength/energy to do anything. I feel like it's a step in the right direction, but I can't do this on my own. What is the next step for me? Do I seek help from a psychiatrist, nutritionist, or what? I have no idea where to start, but I know I want to get better. Thanks for reading, Reddit&lt;3

I'm currently studying how people use social media for health information sharing and the associated benefits and costs. I'm particularly fascinated by subreddits created for health-related discussions where the number of Redditors is larger than 10000.

Here are what you should know about my study:

 1) The study goal is to understand people's attitudes and behaviors related to personal health information sharing online. Built upon the empirical understanding of individuals' information sharing decision-making and privacy expectations, I will design a visual analytics tool to assist people to protect their privacy online; 

2) Participation is voluntary. However, respondents who answered and submitted the survey will enter a raffle for 20 Amazon gift card of $25; and 

3) My study will not incur any harm to participants. Their responses will be anonymous. In fact, this study has been approved by IRB --institutional review board that is also known as an independent ethics committee (IEC), or research ethics board (REB), that applies research ethics by reviewing the methods proposed for research to ensure that they are ethical.

My family member has wanted to lose weight for some time now. They've always eaten very little even though they are actually at a healthy weight. Anyway, it started to get a little more obsessive as they began logging every single calorie and measuring out food, weighing it, etc. Recently they told me they stopped eating breakfast and lunch because they are afraid of gaining any weight from that. They also expressed admiration for anorexics in a certain way, saying they think it is smart to watch food intake and that anorexics are just misunderstood. I am not agreeing or disagreeing with that in any way since I do not have a ton of knowledge. My concern is that this family member seems to be starving themselves and agreeing with harmful actions when it comes to their lack of food...

I am wondering if these are signs I should be concerned of, and what I can do to help. I've already told them that I am worried and I hope they are being safe and making sure they try to get all their nutrition for the day.

148,8h6j2y,Request: how to approach sister with suspected eating disorder,"My sister is 14 in 8th grade. Tonight, my older sister found a piece of folded piece of paper on the floor and decided to see what was on it only to discover a type of journal entry (we suspect was written by my 14 year old sister) talking about plans to lose weight in very concerning ways. She writes about walking home from school, biking a mile after walking home from school which would be 7 miles combined. She writes about wanting to be skinnier. (My sister already is skinny, athletic build so I’m assuming she also is suffering from body dysmorphia.) In this entry she also writes about purging and punishing herself if she fails in her plan. She states “purging isn’t really my thing but I will force myself it comes down to it”.

Concerned, my sister comes upstairs to tell me what she’s found and we both go downstairs to have a look. I see what we suspect my sister has written. It’s scary. I never could imagine my little sister going though something like this or going to these extremes to lose weight.

There’s more writings. In her notebook.

My older sister must’ve gone through my younger sisters notebook which was sitting on the floor. Two entries talking about the same thing except more hateful towards herself and it looks more like her handwriting. She says she’s going to do “meanspo” ? (I might update this post tomorrow with pictures of the entries)

I start thinking if maybe there have been signs that have gone unnoticed. There have been. My younger sister can’t go a day without mentioning that she’s fat. Every time I’m with her that topic comes up. She grabs her belly and tells us to look how fat she is. She comments about her weight, she’s a healthy weight. She compares her weight to that of my own which is the same. I’m 18 and very close to her weight. She comments how big her thighs are and says she wants them to be smaller. She has been walking home from school recently. I haven’t noticed anything in her eating habits however. Tonight we had pizza and nachos and she said she felt full but after awhile went back for more. I know she doesn’t eat healthily though. She doesn’t eat enough fruits and vegetables or protein. (Another thing in the writing on the piece of paper was “my friend gave me a protein bar today but I took one bite and spit it out. I didn’t want to get fat from eating it” or something along those lines.

My older sister and I are planning on confronting her but we don’t know the best approach. “Hey we went through your stuff and found this” she wouldn’t trust us anymore. She would try and keep her eating disorder even more hidden and may even go to more extremes. We don’t want to say anymore that’ll set her off more. We occasionally joke about each other’s weight and the way we look. I never thought my sister might be taking it to heart. I never thought that joking about may have been making her suffering even worse. She’s in a lot of group chats and I know there are group chats dedicated to pro-Ana. I don’t think she’s in one of those but maybe her friends talk about it with her and she’s following their lead.

My sister and I are very worried about her and we don’t know the best approach to help her or confront her. We know that if she is suffering with body dysmorphia and an eating disorder that she needs help as soon as possible so it doesn’t progress.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. If not:

TL;DR- found journal entries my sister and I suspect were written by our younger sister talking about how she hates her body, how she’s fat and a bunch of other stuff (purging and not eating. Excessive exercise to lose weight, punishment if she fails etc...) I’ve noticed signs she may suffer with body dysmorphia. We don’t know the best way to approach her about it.",1525513139,5/5/2018 4:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8h6j2y/request_how_to_approach_sister_with_suspected/,9

TL:DR, on my way back up, things in my life are better, but I need some help.

I've heard/seen things online about licensed nutritional therapists who will ""coach"" those with EDs, and actually do facetime/skype/etc with you while you eat meals, for therapy/support. I feel this would really help me, as I'm frequently on the go for work, and just neglect nutrition. The ones I have found sadly are quite expensive, and do not take insurance. I am simply wondering if anyone here knows of free or low-cost options for the same kind of service? Maybe NEDA or some such place offers help on this? Even a peer-to-peer kind of thing would be helpful. Just so I don't feel alone at eating times, and can really ""process"" the nutrition I am receiving, as I intake in.

Again, apologies if this is triggering or against the rules. I just am looking for help. I've tried local therapists (CBT, ERP, et al.) with no such luck, and the nutritionists in my area are all very ""food nazi"" like (for lack of a better term.)

I've always been pretty fit and know some basics around how much protein you need and other food science type stuff around diet and exercise, but I don't think I know enough to be able to communicate to her what will work best while being sensitive about her relationship with food/calories AND also not seem like I don't think she can take care of herself.

153,8jtm4m,"Request: Recovered anorexic, now objectively overweight, advice on how to lose the weight and not relapse","I would consider myself recovered/in recovery from anorexia for the last fifteen years. I’ve been married for nine years to an amazing cook and have gained weight. Enough that my doctor nags me about losing weight - so between that and the scale, I feel like I have objective data.

For the last month, I’ve been doing a lot of strength training and cardio. I’ve started to run again, I can tell that my endurance is better, and am see actual muscle definition. All of which is awesome.

The food is more of a challenge - I am trying to make healthy food decisions, work on reasonable portions,etc. I am terrified that I will over restrict and there are days when I hear that voice creeping into my head.

I can’t find any studies or objective data about people in recovery trying to lose weight via healthy choices.

Does anyone have sage advice on how to stay on track with recovery while simultaneously staying on track with a healthy weight loss plan??

154,8jnz7f,Request: How do I interrupt this disordered thinking before it gets any worse?,"I lost a significant amount of weight 4 years ago and have maintained since then. At the time I started out pretty healthy, but by the end I was really obsessed with everything that went in my body, I spent all my time thinking about food and how to structure everything around food,etc. My thinking about food and eating had become fairly unhealthy by the time I finished losing weight, but once I hit my goal weight and had been maintaining for a while, the obsession with food and calories faded away.

Fast forward to now, and I am falling into a pit of food centric disordered thinking again - I am obsessed with calorie counting, planning what I can eat and when, punishing myself for giving in and eating something I didn't plan to, priding myself on going to bed hungry, and in turn thinking about my weight and that while it might be healthy, I could be much thinner so I start obsessively spending hours online looking up pictures of other women with same/similar measurements as me, similar BMI, same clothing sizes, etc. My free time is becoming consumed by everything calories, food, and body image and the more I think about this stuff, the more my self-esteem starts to suffer. A lot.

I don't want to be so obsessed with my food and my weight. I don't want this to develop into something worse, or even just stay as it is, but I don't know how to break this cyclical thinking. No matter what I'm doing, food/weight/how I look are ALWAYS in the forefront of my mind and I feel like a prisoner to my perceived self-image. I could really use some advice, opinions, commiserating, anything really to help me break free of this bs. I know it's not that easy....if it were EDs would be a lot simpler to treat...but maybe there are tricks and tools that I can use to at least take away some of my disordered-thinking's power?

Thanks ahead.

155,8jnyvh,Request: Eventual Boyfriend Of An Anorexic Girl / Need Help To Understand Her,"Hey people, about 1 month ago I also made a post here Posting here really helped me so I'm trying again. At the last post here she was in a clinic for recovery. She's back from it but now I think I need help again. Hell, anorexia is a b*tch... I met her about 6 months ago where everything was fine and no relapse was in sight. But about 4 months ago she had a relapse and went to said clinic. Now that she is back and is feeling a bit better the side effects of her ED are still a big problem for me. I simply don't understand her. At our dates before clinic (where i also knew about her ED) and now after clinic she sometimes is like an angel to me if we are meeting. Kissing and cuddling and so on. But sometimes she all of a sudden changes and is very repellent to me. I get no real answer if I talk about it with her. I mean, we are dating each other for about 6 months, where i knew that she has anorexia and where I told her that this is not stopping me from wanting a relationship and something solid and serious with her. And that I'm always there for her. And she continues to date me and continues to kiss and cuddle with me every date. Before and still now after clinic. But if I tell her that I have serious feelings like I did again a few days ago and that those feelings that are getting more and more every date and that I slowly want something more solid like a relationship she always says that she doesn't want it now and that she is not ready for it yet bc of anorexia. This way it feels like she's playing with my feelings. So why is she still dating and kissing me every time if she exactly knows that I have serious feelings and want more and something solid like a relationship but she still seems to doesn't want it. I feel really helpless and don't know what to do. I want to be there for her and will continue this way even if its just like a half relationship and not a official one, but it's really hard this way. I know that I can't force her and that's really not what I want to do. But I want to show her that she can trust me. And that anorexia shouldn't stop us to try the relationship and so on. Can someone give me any tips what to do and what better not? Again: I want to stay with her even if it's not an official relationship but I want to show her that we should try and shouldn't let us stop from this hell of an illness.

156,8jny3y,Request: Girlfriend has an eating disorder,"Hi there. Throwaway - she knows I'm regularly on Reddit and wouldn't want her to see this, at least not right now.

First of all I want to say that even though I don't have an eating disorder, I tremendously respect this illness and acknowledge its impact on those who suffer from it on a daily basis. Having researched a lot about eating disorders in general, I can honestly say, from an outsider's point of view, that it is indeed incredibly dreadful and a true inner demon. Unfortunately, most people don't quite understand how our mental health is just as crucial as physical health.

That being said, my girlfriend has fought this illness ever since she was a teen (we're both practically 21 and in college now). She's one of the smartest, sweetest, most thoughtful and caring people I've ever met. We've been together since last summer, and I truly have strong romantic feelings for her - that's unquestionable. Every time we hang out all I want to do is show her how much in love I am with her. I want to touch, compliment and be intimate with her, go grab food together, have sex (though this is the least of my concerns), and whatnot - you get the picture, all the things couples normally do. We share the same values, get along remarkably well, and there's this feeling that tells me we could share a future together, even though I'm quite aware we're still young and life happens. But for now, I want her. So, here's the thing: I can't do any of these things with her anymore. I'm constantly pushed away, rejected and neglected. This has been going on for some time now, but it's gotten worse a week ago, to the point we considered going on separate ways. But I don't want that and neither does she, even though she acknowledges I'm also in a tough position. I want to be supportive and stay.

Now onto describing what her situation is. She's normal height and weight, and is physically perfectly healthy. To me, she has such a nice figure... I love her body and find her very physically attractive. Unfortunately, she doesn't see that: her mind is very deceiving. Whenever I'm with her and she's trying on some clothes, she calls herself fat and disgusting. She's obsessed with the weighing scale. Whenever we go out to grab dinner or lunch, she binge eats and gets overwhelmed with intense feelings of self-hatred. Even when we used to be intimate, she wouldn't let me touch her stomach, for instance, because it's ""fat"" (her words, of course). I've always tried to be supportive and compliment her, although complimenting her seems to cause adverse reactions now. I also have never ever ever said anything harmful or joked about her appearance. There's some background I want you to know, and it may include some triggers. So, TW from now on.

Keep in mind we've met last summer, and the things I'm about to tell you are all memories she has confided in me. In 8th grade, she started self-harming, precisely due to her body image issues. As you can see, it's always been about the way she perceived herself. Around this time and up until 10th grade, she was indeed heavier, but nothing major. In 10th grade, a good friend of mine, who was friends with my girlfriend back then, noticed an obvious and sudden change in her body - she had lost a fair amount of weight - but never told anyone how she managed to do that. As you can guess, she starved herself. Not only that, but whenever she indulged in binge eating, she'd purge. There was a lot of binge/purging. She was in a really bad place and, in high school, her then boyfriend was also very insensitive and made comments on her ""being fat"", saying he deserved better than her based on physical appearance and whatnot. I was bullied as a kid so I know that these things take a toll on someone. In 11th grade she went to the doctor, who basically told her she could have anorexia nervosa, but my girlfriend brushed it away. The illness dominated her and she continued this binge/purging behavior throughout high school. After that, it turned into an on/off thing - usually happens in the summers when there's more free time to indulge in bad thoughts. She described this behavior using an analogy: ""purging is like easy money - you do something easy (purge) and achieve weight loss without all the hassle and effort of exercising""

Fastforward to now, things are chaotic. It slowly started 2 or 3 months ago. We stopped having sex and being intimate overall. She's also incredibly stressed over her exams, which cause her a great amount of anxiety. But what's really scaring me is that a week ago she told me she had reached a point where everything is striking her at the same time, because she didn't confront her problems sooner. She refuses any kind of physical contact with me, acts very very distant, cold and barely answers my texts. She asked for distance, and I'm respecting it. She reassured me it's not about me, but her. It's about her not being able to shutdown all the negative thoughts that go through her mind. She gave me an option to leave, because the position I'm in is not fair at all, but I refused. I want her to get better, even though I feel powerless. I can't do anything but stay and be supportive. She did say a therapist might be an option, and that makes me happy. Even if she's just considering. Keep in mind she's not telling me what's wrong and keeps saying there's one thing in particular that's bothering her above anything else. I don't know. I'm in the dark. Some days ago, she spent a ton of money on clothes (this is not her typical behavior), and is posting a lot of pictures on social media. She says it's her way of coping with how she feels. Seems to me like she's trying to build her self-esteem almost from scratch and I honestly think she's stuck between two things: getting better and giving in to the disorder.

Finally, I'd like to hear the perspective of what it feels like to be in her position, because sometimes she just doesn't want to/can't tell me, and other perspectives would be gold. Also, what else can I do to help her? I know this is a ""battle with your own self"", but is there anything I can do? Sorry for wall of text, and thanks, guys

Ever since I was in middle school I struggled with my weight and I used to always compare myself to other girls who were skinnier than me, I still do. Back then it was easier to lose weight because i had a faster metabolism. When I was in high school I lost a lot of weight from not eating as much as I would usually.. I never knew what an ED was, I just thought I wanted to be skinny but it was never an overbearing feeling for me. It never was a constant thing. Eventually the idea of wanting to be super skinny faded away because I felt skinny enough and I didn’t have to worry about it. I thought it was just a phase. After high school I gained a lot of weight. I felt so disgusting. Being heavier made me feel extremely depressed and insecure. Then it came back, I started eating less and checking the scale more. This time it feels more intense. I don’t remember ever feeling this guilty or unwell when eating. I don’t remember ever feeling this shitty psychically. Whenever I eat, I eat too much or too little and my stomach is confused most of the time. I do not remember the last time i took a healthy shit. I don’t know if this is an eating disorder or if I’m just overdramatizing about being unhealthy but I’m really tired of living like this. I don’t want to self diagnose myself but I spend a lot of time thinking about my weight and how fat i feel.

162,8ii1il,Request: Help my little sister,"Hi reddit,

A few months ago my youngest sister (14) confessed that she had been struggling with depression, weight loss and eating. I was massively proud of her for coming out and acknowledging the fact she was having issues and wanted help and for the past few months she has been seeing a healthcare specialist, dietician etc. through the NHS.

She has upped her portion sizes and addressed her eating habits but has seen little to no progress in terms of weight gain. She is also having her heart monitored regularly as a result of the weight loss and the now diagnosed anorexia nervosa.

Some visits she gains small amounts such as 400g and other times she loses similar amounts. We know she probably just needs to up her portion sizes and go beyond just feeling full and really push herself but we as a family are struggling with other ideas for her.

She is due to go to America on a school trip next month which has been planned for almost two years and when the dietician and her healthcare advisor found out they said they would have to assess closer to the time and be confident that she would be safe to go.

Well today she’s visited and been weighed and she has lost weight again despite eating more, her healthcare team are visiting school to discuss their concerns with the trip and everything isn’t looking good.

Im wondering if anyone has any advice on helping her better than I know how to, or just helpful information on foods to eat, or just tips to help her out. Is there anyone with a similar situation that could help with advice? She’s really struggling at the minute and I’ve just came off the phone to her with her crying her eyes out worried that she won’t be able to go to America and devastated as she’s been so positive this last month towards everything and this is heartbreaking

This is a “healthy” weight, I know, but I can’t stand my body. I feel fat and disgusting—that the only way “out” is through not eating/purging.

Normally, I’d talk to a doctor about this, but I’m scared I’m not sick enough. I don’t feel I deserve/need help.

173,8k8dfa,Request: I [26F] am worried my mom [56F] may be pushing my twin sister [26F] into an eating disorder,"I feel like this might get long, so if you make it to the end I thank you so much for reading. Eating disorders are dangerous and I don't feel like my fears are unfounded, but I also don't feel like I can talk to anyone in my family about this, especially my mom or my sister, so I'm just looking for some guidance. NOTE: If eating disorders trigger you, DON'T READ ANY FURTHER!!

My mom, I believe, has always struggled with disordered eating. From the time we were really little, and I'm talking 7 or 8 years old, she used to tell my sister and I about how she was fat and never fit in and starved herself in middle and high school to become popular. And it wasn't just an offhanded comment every once in a while, she often provided us a blow by blow of how she ate, say, two slices of turkey, a stick of celery, and a hard boiled egg every day for lunch when she was in 8th grade. Basically she gave her young impressionable daughters a blueprint for how to go about the day to day operations of anorexia.

That coupled with the constant ""are you really going to have seconds?"" she also always pitted us against each other in terms of size. Not uncommon for her to take us shopping and comment about how one of us was getting much chubbier than the other, one of us would stretch out the others' clothes, etc. Mostly it was me that got the brunt of being called ""fat,"" although she would never come right out and say that. I've been reading a lot of the raisedbynarcissists sub and have come to identify that I was the scapegoat, my younger brother was the golden child, and my sister was just kind of there, so any attention she could get, she would. I don't blame her for jumping on the calling me fat bandwagon.

Not surprisingly, at around age 11 I developed anorexia, and this lasted until I was about age 20. Luckily I was never hospitalized or had to undergo inpatient treatment, it kind of just resolved on its own after I had been at college a while and my mom wasn't reminding me daily that I was fat. I am currently at a healthy BMI, maybe on the lower end, and I know that the way I think about and relate to food is fucked up. But I eat. And that's about what I can do. I'm in therapy, I've been in serious therapy for 3 years, I'm on medication, I do yoga and journaling and everything you're supposed to, it's just a hard road.

I was always envious of my sister, because despite our upbringing she always seemed to have a really healthy relationship with food. She was proud of the fact that she could eat a whole pizza by herself, or that no matter what my mom said, yes, she was going to have a milkshake just because she wanted one. Three years ago she found out she had severe hypoglycemia and that made me even more proud of her eating. She always had apple juice and almonds and a cliff bar in her purse.

My mom has always been susceptible to pseudoscience but it's gotten way worse in the past 5-6 years. In the past 2-3 she's become convinced that she's allergic to wheat, corn, sugar, and who even knows what else. She thinks she has celiac disease, but she SO does not. I ACTUALLY do-- positive test and everthing, and it's not something I would wish on anyone. So you can imagine my horror when she claims she has to throw out all her old pots and pans that have ever touched wheat, yet I meet up with her at a bar and I have to pry an Old Fashioned out of her hand.

SO. To the point. Last weekend I went home for my cousin's wedding and I passed my twin sister in the hotel lobby and point blank did not recognize her. She's lost so much weight. I was like wow, you're looking so different... she said, ""Yeah, I'm on a new diet for health reasons, and now I'm a skinny legend."" She could maybe have health reasons... I do have celiac, maybe she does too. Maybe the health reasons are mental health-- get my mom to stop bothering her about her weight. Honestly, I have no idea, and if I asked, she wouldn't give me a straight answer. She loves the way she looks, her instagram since is filled with pictures of her comparing herself to very skinny celebrities.

I recently moved two states over to be with my fiance, so I'm not around anymore. In some ways I feel it isn't my business, but in some ways I feel that if you think that way, you let your loved ones be at health risks. My sister loves all the one on one attention she gets from our mom, it could be something they're sharing, if it's an eating disorder masquerading as a ""health-focused diet."" My sister seems to love the way she looks so I don't think I would get any answer besides ""I'm healthy.""

I'm just kind of at a loss. Does anyone have any idea how I could approach either my sister or my mom? If I thought opening up to either about my struggles with an eating disorder would do anything I would try that, but they're pretty self-absorbed. Even my sister who I really love probably would not empathize with that. Anyone, any thoughts? At all?? Any help would be so appreciated.

tldr: After struggling with an eating disorder for most of my life because of my mom, I recently saw my sister looking very thin and am wondering if my mom is negatively influencing her. And if so, how do I help?

175,8k8clh,"Request: In recovery from AN, my dietitian has told me I am eating too much. I am scared and depressed","After my ED relapse, after months of restriction, overexercise, unneeded weight loss and terribly unhealthy eating habits, I went to the dietitian one month ago. Despite the fact that I was underweight he gave me a ""maintenance"" meal plan, because he felt that a higher calorie meal plan would have been too scary and anxiety-provoking for me and I first needed to gradually go back at least to ""normal"" eating patterns (as in, stop skipping meals) and somewhat adequate portions. I agreed: at that time, eating that amount of food already felt overwhelming, despite the fact that I was also incredibly hungry. I wouldn't have been able to follow a weight gain plan.

During this month, though, I gradually felt freer and more relaxed around food; following the meal plan gradually stopped making me feel horribly fat and guilty (well, it didn't stop, but, you get it), and I very gradually started adding something here and there. Some more bread, some more cereals, some more meat. Really very little overall. I thought the dietitian would have been happy with that, seeing that I was starting to be able to leave the ""safe crutch"" of the meal plan, and make the jump beyond. Despite the fact that I was, and still am, experiencing huge anxiety, fear and guilt around food and my body appearance, I was challenging myself. I was pushing through. I was trying.

Yet today I went back to him with my food log and he told me I was eating too much. He said I wasn't following his meal plan and I needed to cut on carbs, especially breakfast cereals. He didn't even increase the calories of the meal plan, despite the fact that it's supposedly a maintenance plan and I supposedly need to gain weight. Which leads me to believe that either I am gaining weight on a maintenance plan, or I don't need to gain weight at all. Both prospects are incredibly depressing, because I still feel I am not eating what I truly want.

Therefore here I am, again feeling the urge to restrict and an oppressing feeling of shame and regret over the whole eating thing, but this time my ED thoughts seem even stronger than before because they have been somehow ""validated"" by an expert. While before I could teel to myself ""this is the ED talking, it's not you, you have to challenge it"", right now this doesn't seem to be the case.

I just feel the need to eat as little as possible and go back running my knees off. I don't know what to do.

176,8n73av,Request: From one end to the other," Hey everyone, this is my first post on reddit ever so bear with me. About a year ago I had been in an extremely abusive relationship that messed me up in many ways, but particularly played on insecurities I’ve long held about my body (I’m not a particularly large person but both my mom and my sister are pixie-like compared to me). My SO and I decided to start working out together, which eventually led to it being me working out excessively (he thought I needed it more than him), me following a do and do not eat list (which he made with the original intention of helping me which then became a “fuck up” foods list), and barely sleeping (he would get angry if I took naps- he was/is crazy).

In the span of about 4 months I lost a ton of weight which was even more apparent on my 5’3” body. It got to the point where I had headaches constantly and was constantly focused on my weight, weighing myself 7-8 times a day. It wasn’t until last February that I finally left this person for good and started to work on trusting myself again and removing his voice from my head.

Now about a year and a few months later, I feel like I’ve gone the opposite direction. I needed to gain weight, but now I feel like I’m excessively binging while hiding my eating habits from everyone (I still frequently lie about what I eat and when I eat which was something I did with my ex to avoid fights and personal embarrassment over perceived failures of mine). I really struggle because I want to live healthfully but fear feeling like a failure for not going to the gym everyday and for eating OR not eating. For the longest time I couldn’t go to a gym without crying because I felt like a failure (I only knew the exercises he gave me) and now I feel like a failure if I get into a rhythm and miss a day. But I also feel like a failure if I do nothing.

How can I regain control of being healthy while also accepting my body as it is, without restricting or binging? I stopped going to the gym and switched to running in my neighborhood (which I’d never do before because I hate people seeing me exercise) but recently hurt my neck and now my ankle and am out of commission. I don’t want to restrict but I also don’t want to binge and feel like shit either way.

I feel like I need to note that I was gaslit constantly in my previous relationship to the point where I couldn’t trust myself or even admit to myself that I was abused until a few months ago. I struggle saying that I’ve had an ED for the same reasons, and it’s the same reason why I haven’t sought out professional help at this point (I also don’t know if all this would put me in that category?). I’d appreciate any guidance, suggestions, support, whatever you can give me. I just feel like such a failure either way at this point and need something.",1527671189,5/30/2018 4:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8n73av/request_from_one_end_to_the_other/,5

Usually I know why go and do ""routine"". But sometimes I think about doing that, then think that I don't want. And suddenly I stand up, go to the store and buy something (a lot of something). After going home I fell like what the hell that was, but there are food so I know what to do. And no was same situation. I sit, drinking coffee (bought only that). The mind about food popt out, but I wasn't hungry. I stand up and like autopilot rushed to the store.

178,8mxs86,Request: How do you stick to a “normal” diet when “normal” feels like way too much?,"I’m a relatively large, tall woman and I feel like it’s really difficult to find normal nutrition advice for people like me. Most advice about “average” calories and portions don’t apply to somebody my size; they apply to people who are at least half a foot shorter. Advice to “eat mostly plants” doesn’t help knowing they don’t have many calories. I just feel like it’s impossible to figure out what’s normal, and as a result I’ve been wondering if I’ve developed ARFID.

When I was younger (teens) I just ate what my family gave me. I was a bit overweight, but definitely thinner than I am now despite eating more. Over the course of university I gained quite a bit of weight, and while I’ve always rejected the concept of fad diets, I am pretty sure I undereat significantly on an almost daily basis, skipping meals, ignoring hunger cues. I have friends who are smaller than me but have much bigger appetites. I also tend to feel sluggish and tired a lot of the time.

The thing that gets to me the most is I start to get very upset if I go several hours without eating or barely eating. I just get sad and at times deeply anxious about things that don’t faze me otherwise. This happens quite often; I’d say multiple times a week for the past couple of years! When I realize what’s going on and decide to eat in response, I can’t shake the thought that I’m just “eating my feelings” rather than feeding my body in response to hunger.

I’ve looked up “resting metabolic rate” calculators and I feel overwhelmed by how much they say to eat. I did recently download an app to keep track, forced myself to eat “enough” for a couple of days, and my appetite started to feel more normal! But then I stopped because I didn’t really follow up getting enough groceries. I tend to avoid buying what feels like “too many” groceries, and I feel preoccupied with how much food costs even though I can afford it. I find it difficult to justify buying snacks for instance, and then later I’ll be sitting around, hungry, with no snacks, feeling like an idiot. I’m aware of it, but I still do it!

I’ve considered starting weight training, and the amount of protein I would have to eat in a day boggles my mind. I can’t even picture it in my head. Some disclosure, I have IBS, so there are many trigger foods I need to avoid, otherwise they give me painful stomachaches. I also have ADHD but my meds don’t seem to suppress appetite much. The ADHD makes me a bit disorganized with regards to preparing food, but with that and my IBS relatively under control, what I used to think of as my main barriers to eating don’t really apply anymore. And yet I still have these problems with food.

I don’t hate how my body looks. I think it would be uncomfortable though if I gained a substantial amount of weight, and I’m scared that will happen if I start eating the amount I’m “supposed” to again, after years of not doing so. I feel like I know a lot of thinner, smaller women who complain about being fat, and I end up internalizing that even though my needs are way different from theirs to begin with.

It’s just hard to figure this out when everyone seems to say the key to losing weight is caloric restriction and I already do that and have gained a lot of weight as a result. It’s hard to start eating more, feeling like it’ll just make everything worse and not actually knowing if anything will get better. I can go a few days barely eating and my weight won’t even budge. Recently I was travelling, walking all over the place and up and down a billion stairs; weight still didn’t budge. It feels like my body is broken. But I got a blood test last year and it said things were normal. What the fuck??

I don’t really understand what to do and I’m scared I’ll just get told off or told to eat less if I ask for help because I’m not dying and I’m fat and being fat is considered a public health issue regardless of how it happens. Is it just a matter of continuing to try, like I did when I downloaded that app? When did my brain get so fucked up? How do I learn to see a normal amount of food (for my body) as normal? When will I stop feeling like I need an anime-tier ""DON'T GIVE UP"" willpower moment every time I go to the store and attempt to buy said normal amount?",1527586522,5/29/2018 4:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8mxs86/request_how_do_you_stick_to_a_normal_diet_when/,4
179,8mxrtt,Request: Am I at a point where I should be worried?,"Hi, I’ll try to keep this short. I’m 18 and a healthy weight.

I don’t eat very much, and I eat very healthy. I started making myself throw up about a week or two ago. Not after every meal, and not after eating something healthy. But if I eat dessert or a little too much, I feel absolutely disgusting if I don’t make myself throw up afterwards.

181,8mmxbh,Request: What should I expect at initial consult at an ED treatment center?,"I'm meeting with an intake counselor at a treatment center this week and am curious about what the process is like and what kind of things I should expect. Any questions I should ask them? I had to fill out a long intake questionnaire and I am being really honest with my answers but I'm still worried that they won't take me seriously. My BMI isn't low enough to meet the diagnostic criteria for AN, I am underweight though. I'm so tired of feeling the way I do and just want to get back to normal. Admitting I had a problem was not easy, but I finally told my therapist a few weeks ago and she seemed pretty concerned especially since I am exhibiting pretty typical ED thoughts about food. My disordered eating started out from being sick that caused me to not have an appetite and be nauseous for months and over the last year has progressed to being more ED like with a lot of stress and anxiety related to food, eating, and gaining weight. I spend way too much of my day obsessing about food and trying to convince myself to eat. I've probably had some binging tendencies for a good chunk of my life. I used to hate how skinny I had gotten and now I don't care and am kind of ok with it since all of my old shorts and pants fit again. I reached out to this same clinic a year ago and didn't follow through b/c I mostly thought I just needed some help to gain weight after being sick for so long and didn't have an ED. I ended up working with an outpatient RD to gain some weight and was able to gain a little bit of weight, but really only enough to get back to normal BMI. Maintained my weight for a little while but as soon as I started exercising again things started to go back downhill.

183,8mmwg6,Request: 16 yo seeking advice on sharing my eating disorder,"TW Okay, this post is gonna be a little long because I have a few issues I've been dealing with and no one to tell. To start this, I guess I'll give background. I'm 16, and I've been anorexic for about 2 years now. I used to be extremely unhealthy, to the point where my high cal days were me eating well under healthy. At one point I was given potassium pills by my doctor, because I was extremely low in potassium, a common problem with bulimics. I started recovering (alone) about 3 months ago, and man, it's been hard. No one has figured out about my anorexia, although the pills did raise flags for my mom. I honestly wasn't even ready to recover, but my mom questioning me forced me to start recovery so she wouldn't find out. I'm glad I'm trying to get better, but I wish I did it on my own terms, y'know? 

So now, I've got 2 problems. 

1. Should I tell someone about my ED? I've been really needing someone to talk to about this, especially during my relapse periods. I've been thinking about telling my best friend, because she's the only friend I have that I 100% trust will not tell my parents or anyone else, but there's an issue. She dated this one guy for a few months, and once they broke up, I dated him (we weren't friends back then). He told me that she was anorexic and he broke up with her because she wouldn't tell her parents or get help and he hated the drama. Needless to say, I broke up with him quickly after that, but now I'm iffy about telling her about what I'm going through. I know for sure that she's in recovery/recovered now, but I don't want to trigger a relapse for her if I tell her. 

2. Should I see a therapist? Last August, I got my mom to take me to therapy for my anxiety, but I was planning on telling the therapist about my ED as well. The lady was nice, but she told me that since I'm under 18, if I tell her anything that I do that harms me, she has to tell my parents. I felt like I couldn't trust her after that, so I didn't really tell her any of my problems, and she said I didn't need therapy after my 4th appointment. I want to talk to a professional, but I'm scared they'll tell my parents.

184,8mmvnf,Request: A little tip for anyone recovering from anorexia: make a video,"Back in 2016 when I was at my anorexic worst (BMI in the danger zone, exercising compulsively, etc.), I decided to make a video.

Here's what I did: I stuck my webcam on, started recording, took my top and jeans off so I was just in my underwear (bear with me), and did a little turn for the camera.

It served a few purposes—such as acting as a good way to determine how much healthier I looked and to document the recovery process—but now it serves one I hadn't anticipated.

It's not a magic switch, but now, every time I think about skipping a meal, I play that video. And holy shit does it work wonders sometimes. Skeletor Me is sad and very shocking to look at and I nearly teared up when I re-watched it yesterday, but I suppose that's the point: a shock to the system, a reminder that one skipped meal is where it starts.

And y'know, maybe I'll summon the required balls to eat something and still have trouble actually holding it down, but it's the effort of trying now that leads to the resilience built in the future. It doesn't work every time, it's not a magic Cura spell, but for the most part it acts as a great deterrent against skipping meals. As if to say, 'Remember this? Yeah, me too. Let's not do that shit again, yeah? Be brave, knobhead'.

Long story short...I am a sufferer of AN and have been afflicted with my ED since 12 years old (now 26, F) and have spent most of my life in severe states of restriction. It's miserable and horrible and of course, I hate it.

However, recently my entire little ED-world has been flipped upside down and I am so scared...for the last month or so I have been experiencing episodes of EXCESSIVE binge eating. And I mean REALLY REALLY bad binge eating. And since I have never had a diagnosis of BN, I don't actually purge any of the massive amounts of food. Something inside of me just seems to have snapped and broken and I cannot stop myself from eating until I am in extreme physical pain.

I will try to ask for help as best as I can without mentioning specific numbers... let's just say that since April, I have gone from a pretty 'underweight' BMI up to approximately halfway into the 'healthy' BMI category for my age and height. (I hope that was an alright way to describe it) Yesterday was the FIRST day in a week that I finally did not binge. I've read some articles explaining that dramatic weight gain from binge eating isn't a true weight gain because of things like fluid retention and other science-y stuff I don't understand...but I just want help from people who have been on my side of this problem and can give me advice from experience...and maybe even a little empathy.

tl;dr How can I possibly help myself stop all of this binge eating? It scares me to death and even though I hate it, I can't control it and it won't stop! Also, the huge amount of weight I've gained from it, is it real weight? Will it go back down somehow? I don't understand!

In middle and high school, I was obsessed with gaining weight and even looked into cosmetic surgery to lose weight and fix my puffy nipples (which feels very weird to type out tbh) in addition to counting calories. In high school especially it was bad, since my family rarely had enough to eat and we even ended up being homeless for a little while, which I think has definitely shaped my relationship with food. Food was always at the forefront of my mind, and I think that's had a lasting impact.

I also have OCD, which I've read is often comorbid with eating disorders and BDD, and I definitely think that some of my behavior is very compulsive and my thought patterns around food follow a similar trajectory to my other OCD thoughts. It consumes me and causes me a lot of anxiety, and there's room for little else in my day when these thoughts start happening.

Right before college and when my family situation was stabilizing a bit, I started obsessively counting calories and exercising an extreme amount. I lost a little over 50 pounds and would get very irritable if I couldn't make it to the gym or if my mom made a meal that was too high in calories, which normally isn't like me at all and makes me feel very guilty in hindsight. In my second year of college (I'm going into senior year now), I had the worst flareup of OCD symptoms I've had since I was a young kid and gained a lot of weight. I was extremely unhappy with how I looked and started avoiding certain foods quite a bit.

I've started trying to lose weight again, and I think that some of my methods are very unhealthy. I don't count calories anymore because I realized how obsessive and unhealthy it became for me, but now I'm hardly eating anything during the day and sometimes I get overwhelmed and binge eat (which I've done in the past, especially when food was scarce as a kid and when my OCD was bad).

I also started smoking cigarettes about 4 months ago when I made the conscious decision to start smoking as an appetite suppressant to control my hunger. I know I need to stop, but I feel like I can't because I'm not at my ideal weight yet. I picked up a deadly habit with the sole motivation of losing weight, and that thought is genuinely terrifying to me.

Does this sound like an ED to you? At the very least I know I have an unhealthy relationship with food, but I don't know what I can do to help myself. ",1528239398,6/5/2018 17:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8ovg0l/request_i_started_smoking_to_lose_weight_and_i/,2
191,8ovfct,Request: wondering if it is possible to have a subconscious eating disorder,"Just to clarify at the beginning I’m not trying to be insensitive in the slightest to any eating disorders, I’ve had a friend who struggles with bulimia so I know how hard eating disorders can be.

So I’m wondering if it is possible to have a subconscious eating disorder, more specifically subconscious anorexia. I’ve battled with anxiety ever since I’ve been a little kid and it has very much affected my eating patterns; basically whenever I eat I get nauseous and the anxiety triggers a lot of nausea, thus not eating the way I should (we’ve recently figured out it’s anxiety I’ve been struggling with rather than GI issues). My mom also said that when I was a kid maybe seven or eight years old (I’m twenty now) I started developing anorexia and she talked me out of it, since then I’ve had no problem in my mind with weight issues. However, I’ve been quite underweight my whole life, so you can imagine I’m quite skinny. I tend to get made fun of a lot for being so skinny and I’m also allwaayyyssss cold as well and I hate it! I’ve resolved in my head many many times that I’m going to eat more and gain weight and even set up a program on an app to gain weight (which works; when I eat the calorie amount, I can gain about a half a pound a day). But I’ve never gotten past the minimum BMI recommended weight and actually the thought of being a healthy weight makes me nauseous and when I step on the scale and see any triple digits, I immediately get nauseous and then my body suppresses its appetite until I drop down back to the weight I was before and then I get back up a few pounds and it’s a cycle. In my conscious mind, I know I want and need to gain weight but when it comes down to actually gaining it, it’s like my body doesn’t want to. I’m not sure if it’s my anxiety or that I’ve always had that subconscious thought since I was little or what but I’d like to figure out what the cause may be so I figured I’d ask you guys to see if anybody’s ever heard of something like this. Thanks so much for your feedback!

Side note: the last time I weighed myself I had gained a couple pounds and my appetite has been raging lately so I’m assuming I’m gaining weight but I’m doing myself the favor of not stepping on the scale so I don’t trigger my body back into no appetite... seems to be working so far",1528239251,6/5/2018 17:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8ovfct/request_wondering_if_it_is_possible_to_have_a/,1
192,8odqne,Request: Do I Have An Eating Disorder Or Is It Just Depression?,"If you’re reading this, I thank you for taking the time and I'm sorry if this is long but your attention and help means the world to me. TL;DR at the bottom.

I guess I’ll start off with a little background and the positives. I’ve been battling with depression for several years but was only diagnosed with sever chronic depression a little over a year ago. I was on medication for 3 months then got off due to bills and relocating to another country. I have also had counselling but stopped a little over 6 months because I felt that it wasn’t helping much and I have a strong support circle that I’m thankful for. I am glad and fortunate to say that I am in a much better place than I was a year ago and for the most part have control over how I feel/view things in life. Generally on a day to day basis my mood can be summed up to (:/) but slightly on the happier side. With all the things mentioned above, my depression isn’t “cured”, but managed. I also have the common symptoms of depression and have been confirmed by the doctor over a year ago. The pills have helped but I’m trying to regain some control personally before considering getting back on. I struggle with reading, my attention span is still quite limited, and my memory doesn’t serve me well when I need it to. I also have irregular sleep patterns, sleeping 3-4 hrs max per night to 11+ hrs.

The same applies to eating and this is where I’m having problems identifying it. I started having irregular eating patterns during the year I was diagnosed. The pills didn’t help with it. It was partially cause I had to leave my place to get food but even when food was already available, I would still choose not to eat. I know with a lot of certainty I am not trying to starve myself to death but at the same time, can I chalk it up to being unmotivated? I live with my grandmother and she cooks both meals on most days and I don’t ever feel guilty about eating anything and will eat when called to. But when she’s out or doesn’t, I just don’t eat without even choosing, it’s like I delay it until there's no point in eating.

I used to have patterns of overeating and starving a year ago but now there’s no overeating, just feels like a lot of unintentional starving and I’m scared it’s a mental problem that my mind doesn’t realize/process. And here’s where I feel my behaviors resemble eating disorders slightly:

* My food intake ranges from meals when called to eat (rice and other dishes) to just a few graham crackers in a day I feel a sick sense of pride/satisfaction with the pain of starvation. My stomach would growl and hurt but I almost always choose to persevere through it and feel sad at the fact I feel proud.

* I would almost always choose a low calorie option (Ex. bottled unsweetened green tea over jasmine flavored) and I can't even say it's for health reasons considering I'm very indifferent to the things I put into my body

* I do get upset/stressed when my parents keep bringing up my weight (they're asian so it's pretty typical i guess)

* I lie to my grandmother more and more recently about already having breakfast when she's out in the morning

* I lie to my long distance partner about having meals or not mention anything at all because I know how much he cares and worries about me

But here are also reasons why I feel like it's not serious enough to be considered an eating disorder and is just depression:

* Whether I choose to eat or not, I don't have strict rules on how much to consume and it's quite in the moment of what I feel like doing (eating a little more or none at all)

* I've told my partner about my concern and I feel that being upfront and honest with it in a way ""disproves"" that I am subconsciously denying it

* I feel pretty comfortable in my body, I definitely could be fitter but I'm alright being in the normal range, and I am moderately active too so I'm not too worried about health aspects

* I don't have a problem with saying my weight or acknowledging fat around my body

* My bouts of starvation are so unmotivated and seem to be a thing that happens cause I don't FEEL like eating

I'm hoping if anyone has any experience with this or has personal thoughts could share some insight with me. I am considering finding a counselor/therapist to talk to about this but this may take some time and if I do go, I'd just like to get some extra information to confirm/ask too. If you've made it this far thank you so much, really means a lot to me and you're the true mvp for reading this junk.

TL;DR I used to have overeating and starving eating irregularities but now it's just mostly under-eating/starving. Pills in the past did not help with it. I enjoy the pain that comes with starvation and lie to close ones around me about my diet. Some days I survive off just a few graham crackers. BUT I am open about weight, fat, and body positivity and have voiced concerns to partner. My starvation bouts seem to be due to unmotivated and procrastinated attempts to eat till there's not point. I also have no strict rules on what I put into my body and how much, depends on how I feel in the moment (lack of discipline if you will). Unsure whether to chalk it up to depression symptoms or budding eating disorder",1528078443,6/3/2018 21:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8odqne/request_do_i_have_an_eating_disorder_or_is_it/,5
193,8odox7,Request: How Do I Get My Team To Address The Elephant In The Room?,"I’ve spent the past year in and out of various levels of care (outpatient, IOP, PHP, and residential). Each time I go to res, I make what seems like the most progress in terms of breaking my restrictive behaviors. As soon as I get home, I tend to fall right back without the 24/7 support and structure that I had in res. Thanks to insurance issues, I’m currently in IOP and also working with my outpatient team while struggling to readjust after recently being discharged from res.

Right now, I WANT to recover. I’ve definitely been way less motivated/sold on recovery in the past but frankly, I’m sick of bouncing around treatment and being away from work and my life so much. My team in IOP wants to send me inpatient—since I’m struggling so much, they’ve decided res must not be a high enough level of care for me. I’m medically stable and am bouncing around my minimum safe weight so these seems to me, and my outpatient team, to be a little drastic and is not their recommendation at this time. Also, it’s obvious i can do it with structure and consequences—it’s balancing recovery when I don’t have that (because I’m a stubbornly independent grown ass adult) that is the struggle.

I know I’m struggling because I keep hitting the same wall with body image. Im not allowed to exercise until I’m more compliant with my meal plan (and because it’s a symptom I’ve abused in the past) but I feel SO disconnected from my body. I can’t see what is real. My scale is the only tie to reality I have—it reminds me that despite what I see, I am the smallest I’ve been as an adult. But everyday is a struggle and it gets in the way of meals so much and really runs my brain.

My IOP team is basically telling me to keep pushing through the thoughts and ignore them and do the meal plan anyway but IF ONLY IT WERE THAT EASY. My outpatient team sees it is an issue but is unsure of how to really address it on an individual basis. In res, we eventually worked on it but it was always a “well we don’t usually make much progress here in this level of care.” I don’t really know what more to do at this point. I’m getting close to just throwing in the towel on the whole thing because it’s been a year trying and I feel like I’m moving backwards because of this one thing that no one seems to know what to do with.

194,8o7mnp,Request: Relapse and trouble finding help,"So just yesterday, I really started a nose dive into my ED thoughts. My boyfriend of over 3 years is “losing weight without trying” (his words), and training for marathons. I’ve been working hard on my recovery for two years now, and thought I was doing good.

The thing is, I thought I was doing good because I had pretty successfully pushed many of the ED thoughts out of my head. I thought I was being neutral about food, that it was neither bad nor good, like my therapist (that I stopped seeing 6 months ago because money ran out) told me to do. But really, I was binging, eating a lot of bad food, and just going all out. Cooking healthy was covering the junk food I was (well, am) binging on.

My ED has never formally been diagnosed, especially because it’s not “textbook”. I’ve had a mix of everything, anorexia, bulimia, binge eating etc. Today, feeling my super fast what could be considered relapse, I was looking for help. It hurt so bad when one place said they don’t take people with BED (what I identify the most with right now), and I just don’t know where to find ED experienced RDs, and people to help me. Especially because all the time I think to myself “I don’t have a real ED” because it’s not typical, but it is ruining my life.

I live in a big city in British Columbia, Canada, how do I find help? I’m terrified to relapse any further.",1528020328,6/3/2018 5:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8o7mnp/request_relapse_and_trouble_finding_help/,1

198,8nzix6,Request: Relapsing/restricting while on vacation,"Background information: I have never had a full blown eating disorder but have struggled with restriction and at times purging, this pattern has happened for upwards of a decade. The last year or so I have been doing really good. I’m honestly eating more than I have in years and my body weight surprisingly dropped. I feel healthier and overall happier. I hadn’t purged in a year but recently in the past week I have twice. I just feel defeated sometimes but know I have work to do. I had sought help from a therapist once for a very short period of time but it wasn’t a good match. Moreover, where I live there is a lack of resources for individuals with EDs. Unfortunately.

Question: I have a trip planned out of the country for 3 weeks and I can feel my anxiety towards food already looming. I get so caught up with the idea “you’re on vacation, eat what you want,” “work it off later.” I have a huge fear of gaining weight when I’m traveling. Last year when I went on an extended vacation, I restricted. I’m a picky eater/vegetarian so I used this an excuse to not eat “so much” in front of my friend. As my trip approaches, my anxiety is at an all time high and my disordered brain is telling me I better come back from vacation having lost weight. If you have tips for how I can hold myself accountable while on vacation? Or any advice in general, please let me know.

Not every day but let's say 3 times a week. (I hope she's being honest). No matter how much we talk i don't find stuff to say to help her.

Its not for everyone as it doesn't point out people who have an eating disorder because of traumatic experiences. But for those who do it to cope with anxieties and other emotions and hating the way they look or feel... this is for you. It gave me the confidence to acknowledge the bad thoughts as soon as they arise and say ""no"" sternly to that part of brain that tells me I ""need it"".

204,8nqixc,Request: Asking a question about lanugo in recovery,"Hi, I'd like to talk to people in the community about my experience with lanugo(that weird fuzz all over your body that you get when you're malnourished) and am wondering if this is normal. I don't have anybody else to ask and I can't find examples very similar to mine online.

The question is: why do I still have lanugo after 2 years? I got diagnosed with anorexia in 2016(and I'd say I had been in the depths of it for a couple of years) and went to an inpatient treatment center for 3 months. I was ""fully weight restored"" by the start of fall. In 2017, my weight went up and down a little, as a result of new ""behaviors"", but it settled eventually and it's been pretty much the same for almost a year now.

I'm still underweight for my height, but not to the extreme that I was before, and my doctor said that my weight is fine and healthy for my body since it has stayed the same and because I'm not having any problems anymore with blood sugar/electrolytes/internal organs/phosphorus/all that.

Yet I still have all this downy hair on my body. It's not normal hair, it's weird hair. It's in weird places. It makes me feel like I'm a monkey or something. Shaving it off is tedious, and it just keeps coming back. I don't get it. I was told that it would go away pretty quickly after weight restoration, but it hasn't.

I have no reasons to believe I'm still malnourished. I don't think it's even possible that I'm malnourished. I don't count calories or macros because I absolutely hate doing that(I don't want to be anything like old me), but just judging from common sense and basic things that doctors have been advising for years, I think I'm eating what I need to eat.

The previous appointment suggested I speak to my therapist and I messed that up and nothing was done; I just got told I need to “stop associating weight with happiness.”

Trouble is, I’m freaking out. I’m not tiny and I don’t think any of my behaviours are severe yet I’m terrified of finding out that this might actually be real. I’ve noticed so many changes over the last few months.

My roommate and I worked to stop me using laxatives and she’s a light sleeper so I’ve been able to stay off them despite how badly I want to go back. I know that it isn’t effective for anything aside from causing digestive problems but it was a way to hide from how badly I could throw back food.

What’s worrying me most is the shift in opinion and what goes on in my head. I’ve always been worried about eating around others and what they think- especially in public. I worry people think I’m greedy even though I’d be eating my breakfast or grabbing dinner on the go. But I worry people think I’m just being fat.

I’ve noticed how much my appetite has changed since I stopped taking them. I barely have any now yet there’s this physical stress that comes from avoiding binging. It’s partly the reason I’ve sought help. The other half comes from the joy I get when the scales dropping daily even though I’m barely eating anything now.

I know this makes very little sense and that it seems like a random splash of words but it’s 3am and I’m panicking. I don’t know what to say to them this time.

We’ve had a hard road with it, but she’s resisted a intensive treatment. We tried very hard for years to “do it ourselves”, but at best had moderate success, usually temporary.

She finally kind of hit rock bottom, and agreed to go into an inpatient program about 3 weeks ago. She’s been taking it incredibly seriously, and is working harder on this than she has on anything else I’ve seen her do. She looks, sounds, and feels alive for the first time in a long time.

It’s lonely, but we have visiting hours about 4 days a week. The program is lovely, and provides great support.

Tangentially, we closed on a house at the same time, and so she’s excited to not have to move, but also, I’m excited she gets a clean break and a new start. The night before being admitted was the last time she will ever be in the old place.

She’s described her ED as almost its own entity, and kind of like a voice in her head. For years “it was [her] only friend.” I’ve told her this is a demon, it will say anything to kill her. Today she gets her first pass and will see the new place all moved into. We are going to sage the house; we are going to exorcise that motherfucker.

She gained a massive interest in the gym and what started out as a fitness journey turned into, from what I could see, an obsession bordering on disorder. She now looks worryingly thin and bony, so much so that I have friends in common asking me about her health regularly.

I have tried intervening twice now. Once I went directly to her and she thanked me for my concern, said she realized she had gone too far and was trying to correct the under eating / over exercising to get back to a healthy weight. Today I called her mother as I have seen no improvement. According to herself and her mother, she eats non stop (only ""clean"" foods though) and has reduced exercising dramatically. Her mother seems to be convinced that it's her pituitary gland, or thyroid or a parasite from when she went travelling a year ago. My friend wants me to back off and is insistent she is eating well and is just struggling to put weight on.

She is very active on social media, constantly sharing what she's eating and how she fits activity into her deskjob-filled day, which I feel just makes her feel accountable for her eating/moving habits. She claims to be health conscious and that an active, healthy lifestyle is just what makes her happy, but I feel like it's completely detrimental to her health.

I'm not sure if I'm overstepping, if I should back down or if I should continue to push the issue as I'm insanely worried and don't feel like it's being addressed as it should be. Any advice welcome please!

I've struggled for years with my weight and eating. I've ballooned to big sizes and dropped large amounts of weight several times due to health problems. I'm trying my best to maintain a healthy diet and eat regularly. A lot of people have been coming to me recently saying that they feel like I shouldn't lose anymore weight and are worried about my eating habits.

I have started to find myself starting to skip days eating and then binging on others and I feel bad at myself whatever I end up doing. With past experiences of people using my weight and eating issues against me, I pretty much feel paranoid and don't know whether to believe friends, if their ""concern"" is just trying to make me feel better or if they're telling the truth.

I had anorexia as a teenager, and I’ve been mostly recovered for the last ten or so years. I recently lost some weight because of another medical condition, though, and it’s like something switched in my brain. I started seeing a dietitian to try to gain the weight back, and while I’m motivated, I can’t seem to do it. In fact, I’ve lost more since I started to see her, and I’ve begun overexercising and have been cutting my intake.

The dietitian said that if I can’t do this alone, I’ll need to go to a day hospital or inpatient program, but that seems extreme to me. I’m only a little underweight—in my head, I’m not “bad” enough for that. I really want to avoid it. At the same time, I just can’t get myself to stop this downward slide, and it’s scaring me.

Has anyone gone through something similar? Any advice?

222,8s1vy3,Request: Seeking advice about limiting/blocking food delivery apps on smart phones,"I’ve started binge-eating take-out delivery food as a maladaptive coping strategy since several failed suicide attempts in 2015. I never had any sort of eating disorder before (diagnosed or otherwise), but in the 3 years since then I’ve gradually found it a quick and easy to whip out my iPhone and have hot and tasty junk food delivered to my doorstep in less than an hour.

I typically spend £20+ every time ordering take-out delivery food from my phone. It can happen up to 5 nights a week, and every time I’ll order enough to feed 4 or 5 people then just eat until I can’t got anymore inside me. I’ll just gorge myself on pizza, Chinese, ice cream, cheesecake, apple pie, Indian and kebabs, drinking 2L bottles of Coca Cola/Fanta/Dr Pepper until I’m sufficiently distracted from my mental pain. I’ll feel sick but I don’t purge.

Even if I have perfectly good food alternatives in the fridge (eggs, bread, beans, salad, frozen fish &amp; veg etc) I find myself self-abusing/self-sabotaging and getting intense cravings for the sugar/fat/salt hit I can only get from the junk-food.

I have literally spent thousands of pounds (£GBP) since 2015, most going to Just Eat and Dominos Pizza.

Obviously I’ve gained a huge amount of weight and the addiction has gotten so bad I’ve blown through my long term savings, and now I can easily blitz through my weekly income and any potential savings most weeks to satisfy the urge to emotionally eat.

Over the years I’ve repeatedly deleted the apps from my phone. I’ve had my mother reset my account passwords to lock me out of the services but I’ve always ended up creating new accounts with a different email addresses a few weeks later. The longest I’ve gone without was a few months.

I need to know if there’s a way I can block myself from re-downloading these apps to my iOS device, whilst remaining the admin on my own device? Like a selective block on just those apps? iPhone Restrictions/Parental Controls don’t appear to cater to addicts this way.

I just can’t stop myself from using them to binge eat and I’m miserable, I need my smart phone but I also need a way to functionally stop myself being able to install these food apps to my device.

Has anyone else faced this issue and knows of any solutions or has practical advice?

227,8rflie,Request: Seeking Help - Student With A History Of Two Eating Disorders,"I had anorexia for 3-4 years. I gained weight after and so assumed I had recovered though I was never okay and thought it’s because recovery takes time. I’m speculating this is when bulimia started. I go to my dream school and thought i would be happy there since i had worked crazy hard to get there. I left home for freshman year of college and didn’t know exactly why I had a terrible time every time i was alone - my BMI was in the normal range, so i assumed it isn’t anorexia but didn’t consider bulimia. I also have a bit of OCPD, had a love/toxic relationship addiction phase, am a workaholic and have anxiety (root of my ED(s)). The workaholism and ED caused me to use modafinil far too much for my own good. I still use it sometimes after eating a bit more than I’d like the day before and it’s begun to really affect my anxiety and cause auditory hallucinations.

I came back from college and finally went to a psychiatrist. I have been working far too much and was asked to ease that up a little. I got prescribed Zoloft 50mg and am on my tenth day. Heard it sometimes causes weight gain on the internet so stopped eating as much as I used to (sometimes still using modafinil to aid with this). Also heard it may suppress appetite and well clearly that’s happening either due to mod or due to both.

Technically, I’m still eating once every two hours as my psychiatrist suggested though this means a fruit or a cookie. Yesterday I ate a bit of rice so I popped a modafinil today. Not hungry at all and liking my body a little. My psychiatrist and I talked about everything but mod. He has no idea I still use modafinil or have access to it currently and I don’t feel I will ever feel ready to tell him about my last weapon; it makes me thin and makes me smart and it’s just perfect...but it’s also killing me.

Hopefully I'm wrong about them, because it seems like it would be really hard to recover without parent support. I don't have much to go on, so I could be.

Anyway, I had thought of mailing an anonymous letter to the student at her home just to try to point her toward some help. Would this have helped you at all? I included what I have written up. If so, is there anything I should add or change?

235,8ttvpp,Request: I Finally Told A Therapist About My ED,"I’ve been going to therapy ever since I was 15, but I have always been too afraid to bring up my eating disorders because I think that recovery means gaining weight and I’m terrified. I just recently got down to my “normal” weight and I’m terrified of going back up or not being able to lose more if I want to. I go through cycles of binging and restricting and I’ve been eating one meal a day because it fits with my schedule and makes me feel like I’m not piling food in my stomach. I told my therapist about how I told my SO not to invite me when he goes to restaurants he knows I won’t like or if it’s a type of food I’m not used to. He and his friends love any Asian food and I didn’t grow up trying things like that and have massive anxiety over trying new things, especially in public around my boyfriends friends or strangers or a waiter. I never liked eating in front of people out of fear that they’ll comment on what I’m eating, how I’m eating, how much or how little i’m eating etc. I try to tell myself the fears are irrational but then my boyfriends friends will comment on my lack of variety in my diet and they just don’t get it.

My therapist told me she was going to work through processing this with me. She wants to read menus online and pick things I could eat so I can ideally walk into whatever restaurant and try something and I can like it or hate it and it’s not a big deal to anyone. She also said she wants me to bring a snack in one day and she will to and we can just chat and eat something together and the idea of that makes my eyes well up. Sounds horrifying. I just want some encouragement I guess if anyone has had the same problems with food and eating with friends. My boyfriends starting to get a little fed up that I can’t enjoy things like this with him and I understand it. I don't want the anxiety either.

236,8ttv9g,Request: Diet Frustration,"Having been in an abusive relationship where everything quickly went south daily, I resorted to eating for comfort. Like every story, this resulted in me gaining lots of weight.

A few months ago, I started intermittent fasting and OMAD. I figured it would allow me to eat what I wanted without gaining too much weight. Unfortunately, it made me macro/micro and number obsessed. I eat relatively healthy, but I can see and feel myself becoming more and more restrictive. If I see I’ve exceeded a micro, I instantly fill with self-hatred and I cut whatever food is causing the overload out of my diet completely. It feels like nowadays I can’t enjoy food without consequence because I get way too many minerals that result in health problems. It’s like my life has always been all or nothing, unhealthy af or too healthy at once. I’ve become so food obsessed that it’s all I think about and I dread going into the kitchen to have to explain my meals to my family members. Even when I work out, I obsess over progressive overload and train to the point where I’m covered in bruises and fatigued with sweat dripping down my face. My entire self-worth feels based around my diet and exercise routine and I know something’s wrong.

I honestly fear eating to the point where I don’t want to so I can avoid gaining weight again, but I also fear not eating enough because I don’t want to lose the muscle I’ve worked so hard to earn. At this point, I have no idea what to do or what path to take, but I know I don’t want to live like this anymore.

Does anyone have any advice on how to knock this habit and finally feel happy with myself and my health? I’d appreciate any help I can get.

238,8tp8vc,Request: Concerned I May Be Developing An Eating Disorder,"So I've always had intermittent unhealthy feelings around food, feeling ashamed when I eat junk food, body image issues, difficulty eating in front of others, hating looking in mirrors or seeing pictures of myself and whatnot. I've always managed to keep it under control, but it's been something I've tried to be careful with over the years.

Recently though, things have been getting worse. In the course of about two weeks there was a shooting threat at my workplace, I found out my grandma's chemo was no longer working, I started ADHD meds, and I started a new and stressful job that was a two and a half hour commute from home. On top of that, I'm preparing to move across the country in two months. I post all these details just to explain that I understand that sometimes stress and anxiety affect appetite, but it seems like this goes beyond that.

At first when I wasn't eating much it was just lack of appetite when I was on my meds and the logistical issues of eating three meals a day when I'm out of the house nearly fourteen hours at a time. I figured as I got used to the job and my meds and as the various stressors had improved I'd be able to eat normally again.

The thing is, instead of eating more normally it feels like these habits are getting worse. Now when I get home, even if I have food around I sometimes choose not to eat it, even if I've only had one meal that day. Even when my meds have worn off and I have an appetite, I don't want to eat. My job is already really active, about 15,000 steps a day on average, but I purposely walk more to burn more calories.

I've also gotten a lot more secretive about it. I'm usually a pretty open book, but I've been trying to hide how much I've been struggling this from all but one of my friends and I haven't told any of my family. I joke around with my colleagues at work about it but I don't know that they realize I'm being honest about how little I'm eating.

It feels like at this point it's reversible but I'm scared of things continuing to get worse. Am I overreacting to something that's not actually a big deal, and if not, how can I turn these habits around before it's too late?",1529920220,6/25/2018 4:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8tp8vc/request_concerned_i_may_be_developing_an_eating/,7

I still struggle with many issues, but I have been at a healthy weight for two years. Since I have gone over the threshold of my ""ideal weight"" I have been trying to lose weight, actively or passively. I have always been under a diet plan, and I quite got used to it. Some kind of safety blanket. Lately I messed up a lot, I came from a period of undereating (but nothing happened). I feel like I have been overeating for nearly... two weeks? I don't know what's happening, but I feel so hungry. But with hunger comes anxiety and self-blaming and such things. I have an appointment with my dietitian next week and I am just dying at the idea of having put on more weight. And I am so full of shame. I basically don't know what to do. There's a desperate voice in my head telling me to STOP it, but I simply... can't. I am so scared. I don't know how to address the issue. I'm so just tired of this.

244,8t8x04,Request: Girl I’m Dating Struggles With ED. How Can I Support Her?,"Hey everyone.

I recently moved to a new area and have started dating a girl I had started talking to a few months prior to moving. We’ve hung out plenty of times since then and really enjoy each other’s company. I’ve known her about 3 months now.

Early on she told me last year she went through a pretty big struggle with an ED but successfully went through treatment and got better.

I’m well aware this is something that doesn’t go away entirely though and although she’s probably the most healthy and strongest she’s ever been physically and mentally, we have already gone through a few days where it still really messed with her mentally, and I wish I could be a better supporter on those darker days.

I want to get to a place where I can offer support but obviously I know I can’t take it upon myself to try and help and/or fix everything as that will only lead to toxicity between us. I also don’t want to somehow self sabotage or ruin any progress we could make as a pair outside of our own personal struggles by handling this the wrong way as she does seem to become distant and closed off when she isn’t feeling well and that’s been hard for me.

Any tips on how I can support her the right way?

I’ve asked her already and the main thing she’s told me herself is “reassurance I suppose.” But I’m sure there’s more to it than that.",1529747151,6/23/2018 4:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8t8x04/request_girl_im_dating_struggles_with_ed_how_can/,4

249,8sqggo,"Request: I Feel Like I'm About To Relapse, What Should I Do?","I'm a 20 year old male in Hawaii and the past couple of months, I've been struggling with anorexia. In retrospect, I've experienced disordered thinking surrounding food; I'm naturally a short and skinny person and I always felt like that was something special about me that I needed to maintain. As young as 9 years old, I can remember running laps around the house because I wanted to lose weight after seeing commercials for weight loss programs.

This past year has been one of the most stressful in my life for a number of reasons and during second semester, I fell right into anorexia. It sort of came out of nowhere but all of the sudden, I had all the telltale symptoms, restricting calories, obsessive thoughts, no energy, feeling cold etc. In March, I dropped 5 pounds, then 9 in April. Luckily I caught it early on and told a few friends both at school and at home, got some support and was able to sort of recover (though I never told my family).

Things were fine for the first couple of weeks; my parents are very nutritious eaters so I was able to establish a healthy diet and enjoy some unhealthy food every few days while we were on vacation in Mexico. Lately, though, I have started to fall back into some old behaviors.

Because I've been eating nutritiously (fruit, salmon, quinoa, vegetables, nuts, beans etc) I thought I could handle counting calories but now I find myself researching the calorie count of every food I eat, trying to measure the amounts exactly and intentionally overestimating my calorie intake. At my job as a lifeguard, I walk laps around the pool constantly, guzzle water to suppress my appetite and when I sit, I constantly fidget just to burn as many calories as possible. I've also found myself reading and watching a lot about obese people, which is something I used to do to scare myself into undereating. I haven't skipped a meal in almost two months but there have been several times that I had to convince myself not to. Now I'm finding it harder to enjoy the occasional unhealthy meal.

At present, my calorie intake is lower than it should be, but not dangerously low and I really don't want to go back to starving myself but I feel like my disorder is just simmering right now, ready to comeback at any moment. Has anybody here ever experienced this? What should I do?",1529573073,6/21/2018 4:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8sqggo/request_i_feel_like_im_about_to_relapse_what/,2
250,8w6b8l,Request: Recovery And Dairy Consumption,"My story: I'm in the hospital doing my second recovery program. The program is inpatient, and brand new, and the first of it's kind on my province. If I complete the program, I'll be one of the first 3 people to graduate. Policies are still changing to make this program as effective as possible. Also, I'm currently not under weight and physically stable.

My problem: Unlike the last treatment program, this program doesn't offer milk substitutes. It's dairy or nothing. It's been nearly a decade since I've eaten any dairy products. it's a lifestyle choice that predates my eating disorder. I'm not a vegetarian. I am completely disgusted by anything dairy, my stomach doesn't know what to do with it, and I've lost any taste for it completely. I'm even repulsed by the smell. It's not an ED rule.

If I don't eat the dairy, I can't stay in the program. I'm starting my 3rd week. Last week they convinced me to eat yogurt every day. Now they're telling me to move up to yogurt AND a piece of cheese or cup or milk. By the end of the 6 weeks I'll be expected to eat the equivalent of 6 small cartons of milk. I tried to mark it on my menu, I want to be okay with it, but I'm not. I'm not sure if I can do it. I've challenged every thing else, pork, bread, juice, mayonnaise, paste and It's only been 2 weeks, but this isn't the same.

Can anyone hear me? and understand? What do I do? I'm stuck.

There's an outpatient program in this city, but I live an hour outside of the city. I could move closer to the outpatient program, but I also struggle with borderline personality disorder and addiction problems. I'm unsure if I'm ready to leave my parents place again. I've had two serious suicide attempts in the past 10 months. I explained to my parents that maybe we can do this together, maybe I can get better at home with them, but they're unconvinced.

Even if no one reads this, I had to vent. I really don't know what to do. It feels so unfair that I can't be treated because I'm not willing to eat 3 cups of cow lactation everyday for the next 6 weeks.

What would you do? I'm trying to convince them to introduce enriched milk alternatives to the program, but I only have a few days left.

251,8w6adp,Request: I Want To Get Better,"I’ve been bulimic for about 3 years. I’m really tired of this and have wanted to change for awhile. So many times I find myself binging even though I’m not hungry and don’t want to at all. I often start crying as I’m purging and all that and I’m really looking to change, but I just feel so trapped in this constant cycle. Whenever I try to change and try to eat normally I of course, start gaining weight.

I’m not really skinny. I’m definitely considered a healthy weight right now for my height and I know that I’m not fat by any means, but I can’t help but dislike my body and the way I look. I remember when I reached that once (when I was at my worst? I guess you could say) I was still unhappy with the way I looked.

I want to change and I know I HAVE to change because this is surely no way to live. I just have no idea how. I feel so trapped and I feel like a lot of the times when I started getting better, I just catch myself doing it out of habit (like I feel like I have the strong self will to stop, but just do it cause I can and get a joy from eating so I just do it anyways).

I don’t really feel like I can see a counselor about this. My mom is not one who really believes in mental illnesses and therapy. My mom even knew at a time that I was bulimic and confronted me about it once to stop, but after that confrontation we both pretended like it never happened and was not a problem anymore. I really do think now though that she has believed it to stop, since I haven’t been as skinny as I was during that time for awhile.

255,8urscy,Request: Some Good News To Post,"Hi all,

I just wanted to share with some people about some great things that have happened to me recently.

I found a psychologist who is absolutely amazing. She knows so much about EDs, is a believer, is kind, warm, encouraging, comforting, and funny. My psychologist has challenged me in a few ways, one being to name my eating disorder. It's name is ED and is referred to with male pronouns. She then challenged me to journal my thoughts versus ED's thoughts in order to help separate them. She also wanted me to talk to my husband more about ED, to ""indulge"" myself, and to take a trip to a food place that I am somewhat familiar with, but to sample many different things to see what I think actually tastes best.

My psychologist referred me to a dietitian and the dietitian asked me yesterday what Jesus would say to ED. This was slightly emotional as I believe that Jesus would say, ""Get away from my daughter."" She challenged me to continue writing out MY thoughts versus ED, but to also include Jesus' thoughts. Today, Jesus told ED to shut up, and that was AWESOME.

I just wanted to share in case this could help anyone else and to feel some love. I am working on building my support team currently. I also wrote a ""Declaration of Independence"" from ED and am having some people sign it in support of my recovery. ED is still a huge part of my life and there are plenty of rough times with him around. Recovery is a process and I am working on it! I am having little wins by challenging myself (and ED).

257,8uo89n,Request: My Friend Has Been In Hospital - How Can I Be An Encouragement?,"It a very hard disease to deal with but you are a great person for trying! My best friend had an eating disorder in her teens / early 20s, both anorexia and bulimia. Her recovery took many years but now she feels like she never had the disease. Its a myth that you can never recover if youve had the disease for a longer period but regardless it requires a LOT of effort. If she is really ready, wants to face her inner demons and wants to put much effort into it for many years, it is possible! Take small steps! But first and foremost she needs to improve with her physical well being! Then the psychological and behavioral part can really begin. A psychiatrist, therapist, dietician and doctor will follow up on her progress. Sometimes family therapy might be good because in many cases there is something to improve there. So if her parents are willing to get educated and involved, it will help a lot!

There are very good clinics in the world too with a great track record of helping people recover (ex. Mando -clinic in Sweden, Australia, US)

It might be a very scary road but my friend said looking back, she cant believe how weird she used to be and can truly enjoy life now without any trace of her disease affecting her.

258,8uln1i,Request: ISO advice on weight gain &amp; building muscle.,"I had my heart broken last year &amp; was too depressed to eat until i moved out of the house we were living in together. That’s what started this weight loss in the first place.

On top of that I have a severe gluten/wheat allergy so I can’t put on weight the easy way.

I’m currently working two jobs to get myself back on my feet. Both jobs require moderately long shifts on my feet and heavy lifting.

My muscles feel weak and I feel tired more days than not. I’ve been neglecting my health &amp; diet and I am at the point where I can’t even recognize hunger anymore. I try to eat a few times a day and can never finish my food.

Any calorie/ energy rich dietary advice would be super helpful!

260,8ulme0,Request: Worried about a guy seeing me naked for the first time,"I've been struggling with an ED for a long time, and over the last few months I've lost a lot of weight. It's not too noticeable when I'm wearing clothes but when I'm naked it's very obvious. I was in a relationship that ended about a month ago, and he saw me at a higher weight and then saw as the weight started to drop off, and we never really talked about my ED, but seeing all my bones was also never really a shock to him, because he saw me naked all the time, so he saw it come off gradually. I've just started dating a different guy and he hasn't seen me naked yet but I'm very anxious about how he'll react when he does. I'm not ready to start gaining weight, I'm not ready to talk about my disorder with this guy. I really like him and I do want to have sex with him, I just don't want to scare him off with my bony body. Not sure what to do, anyone else been in a similar situation?

262,8ullng,Request: Help with my partner (30F),"I'm basically at my wits end.

My partner has been suffering from AN for just under 3 years now. She was discharged from an eating disorder unit in the UK at the beginning of this year. She stayed with family for around three or four months after that and her condition seemed to be relatively stable, her weight staying just under the healthy minimum. When they felt she was ready she moved back in with me a few months ago. Initially I felt that she was in control of herself, but she rapidly relapsed.

Right now the AN is so strong that she just wants to give up and let it take her and ""turn her to dust"". Every meal is a battle and I can only do so much. There are so many ways to get it wrong for me - trying to get her to eat something new is nearly impossible. Missing a mealtime by as little as 10 minutes can cause hysterical meltdowns that I am sure are going to involve the police shortly. Her doctor is extremely concerned about her weight and urges her to eat more every visit but as I'm sure anyone reading this on this subreddit would know, that is basically a pipe dream. One particularly awful scenario is if she just stops eating half way through a meal and (after substantial urging and pleading from me that she continues eating) I relent and ask if I should just take food away - firstly she is tortured by the fact that she ate anything at all and secondly by the fact that she is starving and I am taking food away from her.

I really just need some advice on how to handle this. According to her doctor she is known to the local eating disorder unit but for whatever reason they're not able/ready to take her on just yet. I fear that she is going to wind up in general hospital again. She is also adamant that she doesn't want any treatment which is a horrifying thought to me.

Thanks in advance for any insight or guidance.

263,8ullaj,Request: mental illness / schizophrenia / depression / self harm,"Hi everyone.

I'm a 30 year old female who has had ""anorexia"" for 16 years. I've been in treatment twice in the last 5 years, though I should have gone when I was 12; I'd be a lot better off right now. I do also have another form of mental illness which definitely contributes to my issues, called schizoaffective disorder, depressive type. I suffer from some intense delusions, including delusions around my shape and my perception, water touching my body, people watching me, etc. I have BDD, but to the extreme. Before I developed my schizophrenic symptoms I had BDD for sure, but it wasn't like this. I can't even really communicate what I see.

And along with schizoaffective comes the deep, dark depressions. I can't get out of bed for weeks at a time, not even to brush my teeth (yes, I developed gingivitis, and no, I don't purge). Cry myself to sleep at night and cry when I wake up that I have to get through another day. I was a self harmer for about 13 years (3 years without self harming!). I am also pretty proud of the fact that I haven't known my weight in over 3 years! :D

Anyway,

Anorexia + Schizophrenia + Deep depression = A very sick girl, mentally and physically.

Anyway, I'm currently struggling in my ""recovery"". Only in quotes because I don't think I'll ever reach it (I'm a pessimist sometimes). I've been attempting recovery for the last 6 years or so and I just have these crazy ups and downs in my life, things happening to me, around me. My world feels chaotic.

I lost a friend about 2 weeks ago and his death brought up the memories of my best friend's death 6 years prior. Since then I've been having the hardest time doing the work I need to be doing. I'm starting to lie to people again. I hate it. I hate my job. So much. I dread getting out of bed and having to face the reality of my next 9 hours.

I recently got out of a relapse on my own without going to treatment (booya!!) and I was doing so, so, so well. Then this all happened. I feel like part of me is using it as an ""excuse"", because sometimes I don't believe I even have an eating disorder.

Yeah, that's right. I've been questioning my diagnosis, which I know is pretty stupid, since I've been dx'd by like 15 different people in the last 16 years.

I hope you guys aren't opposed to the following feelings about my delusions from schizophrenia. I spend my whole day deluding myself about how much work I've put into eating. My delusion tells me that I've done my hard work. But then I get to the end of the day and I'm looking at the proof, and it isn't there. Nothing lines up. So I know that this isn't real. I know that whatever tells me that I'm ""finished"" for the day is a lie.

Then I realize it's 10:00PM and here I am sitting alone without having done all my hard work. So I spend the rest of the night wondering if I even have an eating disorder. I'm not physically ill, I meet my weights every month, but I'm not doing the work, I don't think. Maybe I am, but I honestly don't know. I'm in total denial that I have an eating disorder right now. Maybe I have lost my gains? I don't know.

I haven't seen my therapist in almost 2 weeks because she's been out of town, so I haven't had anyone give me a reality check, which I need from time to time when I can't tell the difference. I see her on Saturday this week, and I can't waiiiiiiit. I know she'll give me a solid reality check. But while I wait, I'm really worried about my intake being enough. I get weighed monthly usually. But since I've made a comeback on my weight in the last few months on my own, they've changed it to once every 3 months. So I'm worried that with this small lapse since my friend's death, I'll lose what I worked SO hard on in my ""recovery"". I don't want that to happen. I fear that it already is, but I have time to catch up if I can start now. I think about having an ""eating disorder"" and I don't feel like I'm like...sick enough or good enough to have one. Or something. I don't know. I don't actively think about restricting. I just don't think about eating. I haven't had an appetite in over 3 years, so intuitive eating isn't a thing for me. I have to use the Recovery Record app to remind me to eat. It's HORRIBLE.

I don't think I suffer from anorexia. Until I look at the proof. Reality checks.

Anyway, I'm sorry for rambling.

I would love any and all support or suggestions. Thank youuuu &lt;3",1530206992,6/28/2018 12:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8ullaj/request_mental_illness_schizophrenia_depression/,4

Currently though, I am dieting since I have an overweight BMI. I haven't had disordered eating ever, my only vice has just been not controlling my portions well. I have been dieting since April, and have lost a good amount of weight. I track my calories on MFP, use a food scale, and eat at a deficit.

I've only mentioned my weight loss once to her in passing. I don't think bringing it up in any way would be of use to her. I'm also thinking of keeping my food scale and full body scale in my bedroom when I'm not using them. But I really don't know. I can empathize with her, but I haven't lived life with an ED.

I'm sure there's something I'm not thinking of. Help me out!

266,8y4fc9,Request: How Do I Help My Sister?,"She is a 29 year old doctor with a naturally beautifully toned body. For the past six months she has dropped her weight by a lot. Im not sure if her relationship with food is harmful, but I know her relationship with exercising is. This is not her first time struggling with an ED, about 8 years ago when she was attending college in Florida she came back startlingly small. At that time I was only a freshman in high school and I would lay awake and text my concerns but she would never respond. I don't know how she was able to recover last time but she did until this relapse thats lasted for about 6 months. Now that I am 25 I was hoping that she would listen to my concern for her health but she has made no strides to do so after promising she would. In fact she gets really defensive and acts like shes in total control any time Ive said anything. Im scared to talk to her about it in fear she will cut me off, we are really close but also very different. Her life is intensity level 100 all the time between her crazy work hours at the hospital and working out, which mainly involves running. All I want for her is to relax and love herself. It is so hard to see your loved one struggle, meanwhile sitting back and feeling helpless in the process. My parents are heart-broken about it, but my dad approaches her from a medical standpoint and my mom is an over-exercizer and I feel like she tells her all the wrong things and talks about numbers.

268,8xnesp,Request: Dealing With A Triggering Roommate,"I recently moved in with a new roommate with whom I am not familiar. She revealed to me that she just got out of treatment for an eating disorder and makes offhanded comments about it constantly, when she’s preparing food, when she’s eating, when she’s not eating. It’s very clearly a coping mechanism, and I’m fine helping her out by listening. The problem is, we share a bathroom and after meal times I can hear her purging and between watching her go long stretches of time without eating and then b/p, it’s becoming relatively triggering.

I struggled with an EDNOS for years and am recovered, at a healthy weight and eating to comfort. I also, however, just underwent a tonsillectomy and lost a good bit of weight. That was pretty triggering but I have managed to put back on the weight quickly and healthily, but it hasn’t been easy. I have been recovered for several years but of course the urges and tendencies never truly go away, you just learn how to battle them effectively. How can I learn to live alongside someone deep in the dredges of an ED while maintaining my own recovery?

269,8xne9u,"Request: Discouraged, not scared, not interested, and looking for hope. Thank you!","Hey all,

I am fairly new to the whole recovery world. I have an eating disorder (not anorexia or bulimia) that was recently diagnosed by a psychologist, whom I LOVE. The psychologist referred me to a dietitian. I have seen the dietitian three times, including today. Both of these professionals give me challenges for confronting ED thoughts, however, today, I just feel really discouraged about the dietitian and I guess I am wondering if anyone has advice for whether or not I should continue seeing a dietitian.

The dietitian doesn't strike me as a super compassionate person (maybe that is because it is not her job to be nice), which makes me not feel super comfortable, loved, or willing to change. Last week, she challenged me to eat from a food plan (very general) and to eat a specific ""fear food"" three times in one week. I told her that it was not likely to happen, so she reduced it to twice. I did the challenge, kind of. I had the fear food and then had a half of the fear food, but I also challenged ED in other ways this past week, so I don't feel like I am failing the challenge, just that I am skating around it some, but that wasn't entirely on purpose, due to other life circumstances occurring for me right now.

Also, the past two visits, she has shooed me out the door earlier than the end of my appointment. Is that typical or weird? I feel like it is unprofessional, as I am paying a lot to see her and I had numerous questions to ask her.

Today, she challenge me to try a specific ""fear food"" GROUP every day this next week. I immediately thought this was too much, so she lowered it to five times, and when I was not enthusiastic about that, she reduced it to four times.

I am no longer scared of this food group, however, I really just don't want to eat it. Is that a crime? Am I harming or slowing my recovery by not doing the challenge? Any advice here would be appreciated.

Also, I found out that my first visit with her was almost $500 USD. Is that typical? I haven't seen the insurance adjustment yet if there is one. The two visits since then have been shorter, so I would imagine they aren't as much money, but that is still quite a bit.

I am in my 20s and female if that matters.

271,8x5ehc,Request: I'm Having Issues With Eating,"Some background info; I'm twenty years old, Norwegian, and a single mother of a seven month old baby girl. I struggled with bulimia and was moderately underweight from the ages of 14-16.

Lately, as in the last two years or so, I've been having issues with eating. I don't fear eating, and I don't think I'm fat, but I'll either eat way too much or way too little, and it's gotten worse the last five months.

When I got pregnant with my daughter, I got myself on a healthy food regime and followed that closely. It's not like I would only eat healthy, but I made sure to always eat proper meals at proper times.

As a single mother, I don't really have much time to cook, so I've been living off of easy-to-cook meals, or pre-cooked microwave meals. Some days I'll cook a full dinner - with salad and everything - but those days are few and far between. Most days I eat one meal and maybe some snacks here and there. I also drink around twenty cups of coffee a day, which keeps me feeling sort of full.

It's only been seven months since my baby was born, and I'm already weighing less than I did before I got pregnant.

The last two weeks or so, whenever I eat, no matter how hungry I am, I will only manage half a meal before I feel like I'm dying due to the stomach pains caused by eating too much.

My boyfriend - not my baby's father - is worried and would probably feed me himself if he had the chance to do so, but as he lives halfway across the world, he can't. I'm also starting to worry that I might be falling back into old habits without meaning to.

I know I wanted to lose the baby weight, but I also knew that it would take some time and that that is perfectly normal, but maybe my want to lose weight was stronger than I thought? I'm pretty confident in my body, but maybe not as much as I thought I was.

I feel so full after every meal that I want to go make myself throw up so I won't have to deal with the fullness, and I'm worried that some day soon I will.

I want to set a good example for my daughter, and I want to eat better and take better care of myself so that I in turn have more energy for her, but it's proving to be harder than I thought.

My therapist says that everyone thinks about food a lot and I just need to prepare for meals and eat when I’m hungry. This may be true but I’m not sure, so I’d like some insight. 

I for sure used to have an eating disorder. I don’t know if it was anorexia or what you could call it... Basically I didn’t eat all day and then come home, get super stoned, and eat unhealthy shit. I am 26 years old, 5’6” female. This started because I was so anxious I would get a lump in my throat and be unable to swallow, even if I wanted to. (This still happens occasionally, especially in public.) for a long time I really wanted to eat but I physically couldn’t a lot of the time. I would gag on my food and have to spit it out so I started avoiding eating in general but especially around others. Then I started losing weight. I was over weight in June of 2016 and had just gone through a pretty intense breakup. I lost a lot of weight in a short period of time. 

When I started losing weight I was excited about it plus I was super anxious and depressed so it eventually changed from “I can’t eat” to “I don’t want to eat.” I moved back in with my parents in September 2017 because I was having a very hard time with my mental health. When I moved I made a commitment to myself to eat three meals a day, and that went well for a while. Now I’m back to avoiding eating, even when I’m hungry, and the occasional gagging on my food. It’s not nearly as bad as it was, but it’s not good. I’m not malnourished, but I’m losing weight again. I get really anxious about eating in general, both about what I’m going to eat, if I’m going to gag, gaining the weight back, and so on. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know where to turn. 

Anorexia doesn’t feel like the right diagnosis but then idk what it might be. Plus my therapist doesn’t think it’s an issue so maybe it’s not! I’m just feel really confused. It doesn’t feel like it’s a big enough problem for me to need help, but it’s a struggle for me. 
I like to eat. I like food, I’m adventurous with food. When I eat something I really like I even have a “happy food dance.” I considered myself a foodie before all of this started. The only foods I don’t like are ketchup and celery! So yeah I don’t know if that’s important or means anything but I wanted to include it.

When I finally told my mom at 19, she said “you might have disordered eating, but not an eating disorder”.

I’m about a week in to finally getting help for my binge eating disorder (but I’ve experienced all the other kinds before), and I’m doing well. I haven’t weighed myself in two years. I got a phone call while sitting on the couch at my parents’ from an MRI place for my injured back. They needed to know how much I weighed to make sure I’d fit in the tube. I told them I don’t know, but the lady wouldn’t take that as an answer. Mom said “there’s a scale in my bathroom!” I caved, and weighed myself. It was bad. I cried, and Mom came in. I wasn’t planning on telling her anything, but I did, because she said “I know this is hard for you”, and I said you don’t understand!

Mom doesn’t remember the incident denying my issue. And after she got frustrated when I said “you don’t understand” several times, I just said stuff to make her happy. I realize for certain I can’t rely on my parents for emotional support anymore. Luckily I have an amazing boyfriend.

Any advice as to how to move on from this? I still feel like I’m reeling. I knew I was heavy, but I was shocked. My body feels foreign to me again. I wish I said I didn’t want the MRI instead of going through this.

276,8wna6m,Request: Having Trouble Eating Regularly,"Hello there! I don’t often post on reddit but here goes nothing, right? I think I may have some kind of eating disorder, but I have no idea how to identify it. Here is a bit about me first: - I’m a 20 year old female - I am an identical twin and was born very slender

Basically, for the last seven or eight months now I’ve been having a really bad problem. I’m not sure how it evolved, but basically after having fallen sick I developed this really bad fear of throwing up. Originally it was just because I often got heart burn after taking my medication, but the fear grew. I stopped smoking cigarettes (probably for the better, hey?) and stopped drinking alcohol completely due to this irrational fear, but it’s only gotten worse. At one point, I was so worried about throwing up that I didn’t eat. I was worried that anything I ate might be a cause for throwing off. This resulted in me eating - no joke - a couple of chips or a slice of bread a day. To me, the grumbling of my stomach was a good thing because it meant I had nothing to throw up. Obviously this diet caused ALOT of weight loss, and so I went from being slender to looking anorexic. No hate for anyone suffering from anorexia - it is a real problem and I can’t imagine how hard it would be for anyone going through it. But, yeah. I am certain this isn’t anorexia, but given my thin state I am constantly asked about it regardless. I’ll admit I’ve gotten a little better over the past few months. I’ve been eating a little more, however I only ever eat one meal a day still (dinner) because I worry that I’ll get too full otherwise. Please help me out here! I’d appreciate advice, feedback, the works. If you have any ideas on where else I might be able to post this that would be greatly appreciated too.

277,8wn9p1,Request: Been Struggling Lately,"I recently had a relapse after what was around 150 days. Falling off once felt like reason enough to keep doing it, so it was a pretty bad one. Sense then, I've been doing alright, but right now I'm in that weird phase where I feel fat but I probably look exactly the same to everyone. To make it worse, I've been eating a lot snack foods because I have been too busy (totally an excuse, but whatever) to make meals. Honestly, all I want to eat is avocado toast, and that's what I've been doing. I'm trying to work on the body image stuff, but it's really hard when it feels having a better body image means gaining weight, even though I'm at a healthy weight. It's extra hard when it feels like the only reason I'm at a healthy weight is because of my eating disorder. I'm going to keep going, and I know from experience that once I'm farther removed and my body calms down these feelings will too. Right now it's just really hard. Looking for support or advice.

279,8wiqkk,Request: I'm Concerned About My Brother's Eating Habits. Help Would Be Appreciated!,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to ask; I'm not the most knowledgeable on eating disorders. My brother, for a while now, has been forcibly throwing up on a daily basis. I have confronted him about this multiple times, asking him why he does it to which he replied (and heavily insisted) that it was the easiest and most logical method to losing weight/not gaining weight. I tried to suggest that there were other healthier ways to do this to which he responded similarly. He insists that because it is effective and that he doesn't throw up everything so he is still eating that I and our parents don't need to worry. But I'm worrying ): He also mentioned that because it is so effective he can eat more. I feel there may be more underlying problems I'm not aware of and also that this may damage his health. He seems to avoid directly answering questions and brushes us off as if it's nothing to worry about. I'm not at all certain, but he may have bulimia. Take that with a grain of salt though; again I am not the most knowledgeable about ED. How can I help him? Am I just over worrying like he says? Is what he is doing damaging his health? What should I do?

Just some further context below.

He did wrestling for 2 years and was pretty good, but an aspect of the sport was that it was optimal to lose as much weight as (healthily?) possible to be put into a certain weight class as a strategy to go against smaller people. I know he would not eat or drink water at least an entire day before weigh ins and I have a feeling he may have picked up vomiting as a method for losing weight from back then. This was earlier winter/spring this year. He has since stopped wrestling now that we've graduated and he is not planning on picking it back up I believe.

He has had severe depression in the past, to which he has told me he is over and was largely linked to societal/family expectations having to do with mostly school. I'm thinking he maybe has picked up these habits as a coping mechanism for stress, but am unsure.

My family is very blunt and will often comment on our weight and appearance. They would tell us, ""You need to lose weight. You're getting fat"" and similar things. They do it because they want the best for us and love us, but this may have damaged his confidence in his image.

I will be straight forward. He did wrestling and his build matches very well. He actually is very well built and I know most girls he ever talks to are interested in him. (Since he was severely depressed before he is very kind to everyone regardless of who they are and often strikes up conversation with anyone so to the outside world there seems to be nothing wrong as it looks as if he has many friends. He has told me though that he actually has no friends). Despite his build he is always wearing baggy clothes as if he is hiding his body, even when it is incredibly hot outside. This may or may not just be his preference in clothes so I do not know if this information is relevant. He has told me, however, that he feels safe when he wears his jacket.

That's about it. I'm willing to answer any questions. I just want some direction :)",1530869596,7/6/2018 4:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8wiqkk/request_im_concerned_about_my_brothers_eating/,3
280,8w94r0,Request: How Can I Help Myself?,"First of all this is my first post/ message so I’m sorry if I’m not doing this right. I’ve always been a bit funny with food: eating “healthy foods”, restricting here and there, and going to brief periods of bingeing and purging (no longer than a week at a time). I chose to get better. I chose to stop engaging in those behaviours, and I was the best I’ve been the last 2 years. My anxiety around food improved dramatically though the niggling feeling of wanting to be thinner always persisted at the back of my mind (but hey I’m a woman so yea). I went through a very painful breakup around 6 months ago that left me reeling. I couldn’t eat properly for around 3 months, and overexercised to cope with the heartbreak. I injured my back/ leg, and so I’ve been relying on restricting food and skipping a meal everyday to keep off the weight I initially lost, but now I keep bingeing on high calorie/ sugar foods. The impulse to purge after meals is getting stronger. I am back at square one, and the cycle will continue as it did in the past. No one knows I’m struggling because I eat normal portions, am at a normal weight and am not selective in front of people, but the anxiety is slowly killing me. I don’t want to live this way. Logically I know this is a coping mechanism to numb the pain of my breakup, but I am too ashamed to speak up about it. I am now at the point where my friends and family are breathing a sigh of relief because they see I’m over the heartbreak and I’m “normal”, but I feel like if I don’t diet and battle with my weight I will lose the crutch that has gotten me this far. I am sorry this is long. I don’t know what to do. I’m not sick enough to ask for help, but I’m tired of living this way. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.

I shared with him that I dropped to a dangerously low weight because I was broke and with my low apetite I just couldn't eat enough beans and rice. He says things like, ""I'm gonna go dig through \[my sister's\] fridge, and ""This casserole went bad, but oh well, I'll live.""

284,8zf8qr,Request: Can I be overweight and have an eating disorder?,"I've been a picky eater for as long as I can remember. I was also a pretty ""skinny kid."" As a teenager I was still picky, but I started to eat a bit healthier and ate more junk food. My step mom wanted me to be skinny, even going as far as putting a BMI chart on our fridge and highlighting the weight I should be at for my height. So to make everyone happy I started running. I began running once or twice a day from age 11-20.

Now I'm a married adult and I no longer run (bad knee, just never really loved doing it either) and I've gained a lot of weight. Like 50 lbs in 7 years. So I'm about 30-40lbs overweight.

Most of what I eat is junk food. Last month I realized that I was only eating pizza and candy/sweets. I finally made an appointment with a nutritionist and I had to put it all on paper. It's pretty bad.

So we decided to cut way back on sugar. I really tried, and I cut a ton out, but I'm still not completely at goal. To make it worse, after cutting out tons of junk food and eating fruits/veggies and proteins I haven't lost any weight. I'm still hungry all the time so I've been eating fatty foods (fries, cheese, pizza). That's probably why I'm not losing.

I love being active and outside. I just feel like I'm not burning like I did when I ran.

I made a few calls to find a therapist and no one is ""available"" (willing) to take me, which is so discouraging.

I feel like there's really something wrong with me. Why can't I just eat like a normal person?! For how much I exercise, there is no reason I should be overweight. I hike, walk, kayak.

285,8z6ufq,Request: Research Participants Sought!,"Hi everyone, my name is Sofie, and I’m currently undertaking a Master’s at University College London (UCL), Department of Psychology &amp; Human Development.

For my Master’s dissertation, I’ll investigate the potential association between social emotional functioning in young adults with eating disorder symptoms, and associated help-seeking behaviour. A better understanding of this would be highly valuable in order to increase help-seeking rates for eating disorder symptoms, so that as many people as possible can be helped at an early stage.

Invited participants for the study are females between 18 and 30 years of age, who experience any kind of eating disorder symptoms, of any degree. The data will be collected through the online platform Qualtrics, where interactive digitised tasks exploring social and emotional functioning will be used together with questions regarding eating disorder symptoms, help-seeking behaviour, and social emotional functioning. It is expected that the data collection will take approximately 20-30 minutes. The online tasks and questions can be completed in one session, or be saved and completed over several sessions. All responses will be completely anonymous and confidential. The project has been approved by the ethics committee at the Department of Psychology and Human Development at the Institute of Education, UCL.

Further information about the project, data management and confidentiality is provided if you click on the survey link: https://uclioe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6lBmBTeVCxHBJY1

Important! There is one question on current weight, and several potentially sensitive questions regarding eating disorder symptoms. The first page is information only, and you can decide whether you want to take part or not after reading the information. My contact details can be found on the information page via the link.

Your help completing this online questionnaire would be highly appreciated – it is not the easiest topic to find participants for, but it is very close to my heart so I’m hopeful that I will be able to get a large sample. If you know anyone who would be interested, please just pass on the link.

286,8z6tyb,Request: Help Please...,"Hello,

I am very scared about my girlfriend potentially suffering from bulimia. We are in a longish distance relationship right now (5 hours away, see each other 1 day a week) and We have been dating for 4 months. For the first couple I kept trying to see if she would want to go to the gym with me, just as a fun activity we could do together. She kept saying no and eventually revealed it was because she is ashamed of her (very healthy and normal weight) body and thought that I was too.

Then about a month ago we were talking about ""types"" and I said I liked fitness chicks. She asked if i could prefer if she worked out and i said yes. There is more to the conversation, but she took this as that I found her fat/unattractive and has since focused a lot on what she eats and started exercising on her own.

I thought this was good until today, in which she revealed to me that the first 2 weeks after I said this, she was exercising... A lot, and eating ~1 meal a day. She then revealed to me that in those 2 weeks, she purged twice after eating a big family dinner. She said she has not done it since, but still seriously considers it and has to convince herself not to after eating large quantities of food (not binging, just like a big dinner with the family or something).

She said it isn't a big deal and the feeling to purge is going away and she is ""normalizing"" again, but I am still terrified about her future health and the potential progression of something more serious... I have no idea how to help or see if she actually has something I should be concerned about, so please i will take any advice possible.

I'm a 22 year old male, 6'3"" and have wanted to lose weight for a while now, I've been thinking I was a little bigger than I should've been since High-School but did nothing about until a couple of weeks ago.

Although those around me say I'm nowhere near being fat, I always thought I was. I've always had really low self-esteem.

I started fasting. I go 1-2 days without eating at a time, sometimes without drinking anything and then I will pig out and go back to not eating for a day or two. I never thought I couldn't go without eating for long spurts but I suddenly found I could and it was easier than I thought it would be and I've been continually doing it for 3/4 weeks. I've lost weight and have been pretty happy with it.

However, today I was taking a shower because I was feeling freezing cold and I started feeling a little odd, I got to the point where I couldn't brush my teeth because I felt completely out of it, I got out of the shower and everything went dark, I got extremely dizzy and lightheaded and could feel my heart beating through my chest, I thought I was having a heart attack at first but I knew I hadn't eaten in around 40 hours. So I plodded to the fridge and ate ate a pinch of shredded cheese and I felt a lot better.

289,8ys1z5,Request: Why Is My Perception So Warped?,"Hello, I really need some help with this and was hoping you guys might have some advice based on your own experiences. It makes me feel like I'm going crazy sometimes.

I struggled with anorexia for years, and I was hospitalized in 2016 because my health had deteriorated so much. I stopped going to therapy and stopped seeing doctors/the dietician about 6 months ago. I want to figure this out without professional help because I feel like my experience in therapy and with doctors was traumatizing for me.

I'm generally very happy now, and my body image is usually good, but when people make comments about how I look or my weight, I am usually so surprised. Of course I still have insecure moments or even insecure days. But the main thing is that I feel like I am so much bigger than most people, even when I can see that I'm not. I'm taller than most women I know and even just see when I'm out in public, and it makes me feel like taller = fatter. Even if a woman is short and ""looks"" like she is overweight, I still feel like I look bigger than her.

I'm also generally shocked when I find out how much I weigh. The last time I weighed myself, the number was significantly lower than what I thought it would be. It's a healthy weight for my height; but I was certain that the number would be within my ""scary range."" This was a while ago and I don't know where the scale currently is. I look the same now as I did then, but I still get thoughts telling me ""you've probably gained 5-10 pounds.""

Lastly, I just assume sometimes that people think I'm fat, but then they call me skinny. This week my boyfriend picked me up then commented that I am ""really tiny."" I was surprised because even though I logically know he doesn't at all, I worried that he was secretly thinking I'm fat.

293,91fx2o,"Request: Struggling With ""Not Being Underweight Enough"" To Warrant My Hunger","Hi,

I am recovering from a restrictive ED. I am now at the low end of a 'healthy' BMI, but my doctor has said I still need to gain some weight, also because I'm still slightly under the weight I had pre-ED (although not by that much - I was always very skinny). He believes I don't ""want"" to gain weight, but he doesn't understand.

Problem is, I have endless hunger. I get huge cravings for everything. I touch a cereal and I'd want to finish the whole box. I see a cookie and I spend all day thinking about cookies cookies cookies. I went to bed the other day DREAMING about peanut butter. I salivate whenever I think of pasta, or jam, or milk, or plain oatmeal, or bread, or even fruit. I always prepare myself these huge volume plates (obviously low-calorie) just to feel that I am eating lots of food. I can't tolerate calorie-dense food like, say, nuts, because they're too ""small"" and they finish too quickly and the moment food is over is always devastating for me. Yesterday I was so craving for food that I cooked a whole box of veggie soup and ate it just like that, at like 11 AM. It seemed like the bestest most wonderfulest food I had eaten in a long time. I mean, veggie soup is alright, but I guess you have to be pretty desperate to crave it so much you have to cook a whole batch of it mid-morning and eat it on the spot.

Now you'll say, what's the problem? Give in to your cravings! But I can't. I can't because I am not technically underweight and I don't have enough ""buffer"" to eat whatever I want without gaining too much weight. I don't know if it's clear enough. If I had to gain, say, 20 kgs underweight I would feel much ""safer"", but right now I feel like I am teetering on the edge of ""going over"" and therefore I can't ""afford"" eating lots of food, because that's only for those who are very underweight.

Therefore I am literally trying hard to lose weight just to feel allowed to eat more food. The consequence is that I spend my whole day thinking about food all the time, like a loud hammer continuously boring a hole in my head, like someone in my brain is constantly screaming ""FOOD FOOD FOOD FOOD FOOD"" and I can't hear anything that happens around it. It's exhausting and I am totally worn out. I don't know what to do. Eat normal portions? How can I eat normal portions if they don't satisfy me one bit? How can I tolerate the experience of finishing a normal portion and feeling like I'm hungrier than before, but with the extra guilt that comes with having eaten a normal portion? For me it's better to just avoid food, because at least I can justify my hunger a little more.

I don't really know if you will understand anything of this rambling. I just don't know what to do. I feel stuck and helpless.",1532424959,7/24/2018 4:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/91fx2o/request_struggling_with_not_being_underweight/,18

I'm in college now and still tall and lanky, but recently (at least it seems like to me), my stomach is looking bigger and sticks out more. Everyone still refers to me as skinny and says I need to eat more, but every time I look at myself in the mirror, my stomach looks awful and I force myself to work/run out more, or eat less. When it is at it's worst, I'll only have 2 meals a day. I'm so used to being referred to as skinny, that for some reason I feel the need to remain that way. I wish I could bulk up and I've tried working out more this summer, but every time I think I'm looking bigger I panic.

I know this is unhealthy, and I wish I could get over it, but it's already happened today.

I live alone for the first time in my life. I used to live with my parents , then a college dorm and now I have my own apartment. Before, I had parents who would cook or at least scold me into eating a sandwich or roommates who would make social events out of every meal so we'd all go together. But I was never very hungry, I'd just eat so they wouldn't worry or so I wouldn't be the odd one out. It used to be a running joke that I never actually ate anything but now it's a real issue.

But now I'm alone and I just can' force myself to eat anything. I wake up at nine, have coffee for breakfast and that usually holds me over until I cook dinner at about eight or nine pm. I know it's not healthy but I'm never hungry. It's starting to make me sick at this point with side affects like nausea, hairloss, dizziness, exhaustion and the like. But because I've gotten so used to eating nothing, the few times I've forced myself to eat two or even three meals in a day, I felt horribly nauseas. My doctor says that I'm malnourished and need to eat more but I really don't know how without making myself feel sick.

297,90ksvn,"Request: I am underweight, I want to gain weight but I am never hungry","I hope this is a valid  submission. I am fairly underweight and always was. I eat kid portions,  cant finish an entire kebab, cant finish a medium sized pizza in one  sitting, am content with one average sized bowl of curry etc.

Im a guy and honestly I wish I was buff and could gain weight, but it  seems impossible. I just wish I wouldnt have to eat, its like im not  interested in food even though a lot of it tastes very good. My mother  thinks im simply too lazy, and that its just very bad habits. It has  always been like that though (I remember my kindergarten teacher trying  to shovel spoons in my mouth). After years and different people trying  to get me to gain weight, she has given up and just frowns when I visit  and I dont finish the food she cooks. Its like I have this stubborn  unwillingness to feed myself. I could go without eating an entire day, I  would just eventually feel cold and maybe have a bit of a grumble in my  stomach, but not more. I would tell myself to get something to eat now,  because I know I really should, but I dont really care for it, dont  really want to but will reluctantly- essentially I am just not hungry.  Often I just cant be fucked to cook something, even though I dont even  mind cooking and have all the ingredients at home, other times people  literally put food in front of me and I just reject it for reasons i  dont understand. I like eating alone though and prefer that to other  people being there and *watching* me, so maybe that has something  to do with it. I mean people tried to force me to eat all my life, but  likewise I have had this condition all my life (I was born prematurely  and was a very picky kid). 

People have told me I look like a holocaust survivor or gollum or  something whenever I take my shirt off, so obviously I wish I could  change it. I went to the gym for a while, drank weight gainers, protein  shakes as well as trying to eat properly and regularly and only ended up  gaining 5kg. I did this for several months and it kinda felt like a  wasted effort.  Likewise if I spend a week at home doing nothing, just  feeding on garbage like cereal or dry bread etc. I dont end up losing  weight either. Its like my body is fixed. It sucks. Ideally I would want  to gain, so that I can work out and gain muscle and look good, but it  sure seems impossible. 

I feel fine, I manage to live with my life like a normal human being,  I am happy and I have accepted the way I am a long time ago. I am not  suicidal or anything. I just don't understand how I can do all the same  things my friends and roommates do whilst eating significantly less than  them.  I dont relate to other people with eating disorders at all. I  have met a couple, they think *I get them* or their mentality or  something, but I don't really. I can only relate to their symptoms I  suppose (like getting a head rush when standing up to quickly, always  freezing etc.) but not to their motivations or other things really. Im  also not hesitant to pick something up to eat quickly on the go etc. I  eat meat, no moral issues or with eating in general. 

Sometimes I have appetite to eat something specific, and Ill go to  great lengths to cook it the way I like, but ill still only eat one  bowl, although I could technically fit another one or at least a little  bit more, I would just have to go to the kitchen and get it. However at  that moment eating is something I am not concerned with anymore, its not  a problem to deal with anymore and of no interest to me. Sometimes if I  really like the food, or if spent a lot of energy (doing a lot of sport  or something equivalent) ill eat until I am truly full though. 

Because of university I try to make myself eat three times a day  because I know it affects my studying in one way or another and I know  that you cant expect a car to race if you dont fuel it adequately. But  thats ultimately the only reason I eat at all. Yes food can taste good,  but I eat because I have to and cant get around it. I actually tried to  sustain on food supplement shakes for a while because I thought that it  would be more convenient than having to eat, it wasnt really an option  though. People ask me if I'm anorexic but I dont puke after eating and I  dont want to be thin. To me it doesnt really matter how you would  classify it. I just know that it's unhealthy and its not what I want, so  what the fuck is wrong with me and how do I fix it? 

Thank you in advance, Im just looking for an explanation and possibly advice",1532128831,7/20/2018 18:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/90ksvn/request_i_am_underweight_i_want_to_gain_weight/,6

301,904bz6,Request: Starving reduces my anxiety. Asking for advice.,"I am struggling with eating disorders from childhood. I was binge eating and very over weight as a child. After that, I developed AN and B/P disorder at the age of 16. I was binging and purging everyday or at least every two days and when I was not doing it, I was starving myself. There was a heavy anorexia period in my life that I was in a cycle of not eating anything (anything at all) for 4 days and b/ping other 3 days and then repeating this. Now I am 24 years old, B/P free for 5 months and also haven't starved myself for 5 months. I try to eat very healthy and plenty to compensate all these nutrition deficiency. In that 5 month period, my anxiety got so much worse. I've developed Obsessive-Compulsive Behaviour (checking things over and over again or washing my hands for several times) and serious Health Anxiety (I am googling symptoms and convinced that something is wrong with me). I am always anxious and seriously believe that something terrible is about to happen to me. I actually sit and wait for it. Today, something happened. I was so busy and had to skip two meals and as I get hungry I realised that my brain was not over active and I could calm down and I was not overthinking about every single thing. My anxiety was so much better. So, does anyone go through something like that in recovery? Right now, as I discovered this it is very hard for me to not to starve myself because anxiety is killing me and I was not able to sleep properly for several months. What can I do about to this anxiety? Is there any scientific explanation of this? I am thinking that maybe some people have this overly active brain that does not function properly and starving/not giving it enough energy prevents it from over thinking? I really need help about it.",1531992225,7/19/2018 4:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/904bz6/request_starving_reduces_my_anxiety_asking_for/,8

My (21m) girlfriend (23f) suffers with BED. She has had a really rough past few months with our final year at college, but we've come through it really strong. We had some issues and she was going through one of her rougher patches.

I know she is ready to make a change, she has already planted the thought in her head. She said she wanted to get a personal trainer, but I don't know if that is possible due to our post graduation, unemployed state.

How can I motivate her to start losing weight and going to the gym? This is not due to me being unhappy with the way she looks, as I think she's beautiful all the time. This is simply due to health and confidence reasons- i would love nothing more for my girlfriend to feel confident with herself, and live a healthy (healthier) lifestyle.

Can anyone give me some advise? I would love to go to the gym with her to push and motivate her but I don't think she would feel confident or comfortable with that at the moment.

317,920u0r,Request: Has anybody else dealt with ED-related urinary incontinence?,"Hi, I'm a 20M who has struggled with restrictive eating patterns. Though I am trying to make a recovery and I'm not restricting like I did in the grip of my disorder, I am still slowly losing weight. My summer job involves a lot of walking and even though I don't want to go back to restricting, I find the idea of gaining weight very distressing. My main anxiety is that once I start gaining weight, I won't stop.

Anyway, the point of this post was that the past couple of months, I've had minor levels of urinary incontinence that have increased especially during the past two weeks. It's mostly stress incontinence; sometimes when I sit down, bend down or stand up, I feel a small release of urine, especially after I have just gone to the bathroom. I can feel it coming but the only thing I can do to control it is avoid doing whatever causes the stress until I can get to a bathroom.

The past few days though, I've wet the bed several times. When I was younger, I dealt with nighttime incontinence and couldn't hold it through the night until I was about 12. The past couple of mornings, I've woken up wet. I'm worried because soon I'm going to visit a friend and I don't want anything to happen while I'm there or during the six hour flight. It only occurred to me this morning it may be a side effect of my eating issues. I was reading a couple articles that said it's common but not widely reported (unless asked) in those who do or have suffered from AN.

Is there anybody else who has had this problem during the recovery? How did you deal with it? Do you feel like your doctor was able to help? Thank you.",1532597973,7/26/2018 4:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/920u0r/request_has_anybody_else_dealt_with_edrelated/,4

Last night I tried to talk to him about how uncomfortable I get at work when people comment on how great I look since losing all the baby weight, and ask me how I did it. They ask how much weight I lost. Obviously I just never know what to say. I act as if I have no idea how it happened. I say “eating baby food and chasing around a toddler!” And tell them I don’t weigh myself so I don’t know. That’s a lie, too. Anyways, I was expressing how I don’t know what to do, and he didn’t have much to say and then said it’s just really hard to know what to say or how to help. And I know that. He has been so supportive, but I think I need to talk to people who have experienced this too. So I’m looking here for support. I’ve been through therapy, AA, NA, IOP and inpatients, mostly for drugs. I shared a very small but about my ED thought out all of that, though. I know it is killing me, I want to be healthy for my daughter, I want to not have panic attacks every time I think about looking for a snack in my house, or when I go to the grocery store, I want to not feel like I’m going to vomit every time I have dinner at my moms, because she knows I’m restricting and forces me to eat a full meal with her, I don’t want these comments about how good I look to fuel my fire but help me to accept myself. My mom and sister say things like, if you starve you’re self you’ll just gain it all back when you start eating again. That comment rings in the back of my mind constantly. Sometimes my daughter tries to feed me some of her snacks, a piece of banana or something and it gives me anxiety. Like I said I have never truly talked to someone about this. I am so ashamed of myself. I wish I could accept the soft parts of my body. I wish that voice wasn’t in my head. When I’m hungry it tells me I should just kill myself, it shouldn’t be this hard.

To keep an incredibly long story short, I’ve had bad eating habits for roughly 4 years now. They consist of eating a meal or less pretty much everyday. These bad eating habits also seemingly came out of nowhere; I can’t figure out where they came from, or why they became a thing in the first place.

I apparently appear to be underweight, but I don’t see how..I could very well be blinded..I don’t know.

When I talk to people I know who’ve struggled with ED, they all have mentioned that they, to some degree, constantly monitored and doubled down on their caloric intake. They also would say how food practically consumed their mind, and how they hardly thought of anything else. I, on the other hand, don’t care for calories and food is hardly on my mind; it’s only on my mind when I go to tell myself “I’ve already eaten today.” When I don’t eat, I usually don’t think anything of it — it’s a practically thoughtless function.

I’m always ashamed afterwards of having tantrums or breakdowns but I can’t help it when it happens.

Apparently large, grown men claim to subsist on the same calorie amount that I still feel hungry on, as a trans person on male hormones who is also at least 6-12"" shorter than most grown men.

I’ve struggled with a restrictive eating disorder of varying degrees of severity for about nine years now (didn’t realize that until now, but wow, yeah, I guess it’s been that long). I’ve always been afraid of gaining weight, mostly because it made me look more feminine. I’m on hormones now and feeling better about my body because of it, but I still struggle with not wanting to gain fat, while also fighting hunger.

I started doing intermittent fasting and pushing my meals back, eventually until I was only eating one meal a day. This came from a want to just be able to eat larger meals and actually feel full, though hidden under the guise of wanting to ""be healthy."" I think there’s some health merits to intermittent fasting, but to be honest I miss breakfast.

I lift weights and I want to gain muscle. But I’m scared to eat more because on other fitness forums I see guys way, way bigger than me eating the same amount I’m eating, or even LESS, and claiming to actually be gaining weight, which is baffling to me.

But really, I just don’t understand calories or eating anymore. I weigh and track all of my food. I feel like I can’t stop eating until I’m bursting, like there’s no grey area, just black or white. I want to be strong and lean and healthy, but I also don’t want to be ruled by food. I don't know where to start with that.

330,9481sz,Request: Advice about confronting a friend with a severe ED,"Someone very close to me (long time friend/coworker) has been struggling with an eating disorder for many years. It wasn't something that she shared with anyone until about four months ago. I always knew something was wrong and knew she struggled with her mental/physical health, but, I had no idea of the specifics.

It's really bad. She initially came out to me about it when she decided to get help. She started a partial hospitalization program. She entered the program and was in it for over a month. They called it EDNOS with purging. She seemed to be doing really well and was very open to me during that time about her struggles and her successes. I was so relieved she was starting to get help for something that was so serious. Her mindset was what really gave me hope during that time. She never used to be so honest about everything, and admitted to how often she felt she had to lie to me. I was really optimistic that many things in her life could now start to improve.

After a conflict in scheduling, she had to withdraw from the program and said she'd continue trying to make progress on her own. I could immediately tell that she didn't have much conviction behind that statement. It hasn't gone so well. Not only did she start getting worse but she also stopped sharing as much with other people. She doesn't deny her struggles but no longer talks about it, trying to sweep it back under the rug like she'd done for almost a decade. The thing is, now that I know what to look for, I see her struggling daily. She often purges after meals and thinks nobody notices. I notice. The subtle behaviors are obvious after I knew what to look for (not speaking until she's had a drink, constantly clearing her throat, her voice, immediately popping multiple pieces of gum or breath mints, look of guilt/discomfort all over her face, trying to immediately force casual conversation with everyone around her as to not draw suspicion, etc).

I haven't openly confront her about the purging because the setting is usually around other people and I don't want to cause her any additional shame or discomfort so I just play along like everything's fine (though I must look silently devastated every time). However, I don't know how to approach her and say that I'm noticing how bad she's doing without offending her or risking her going directly to denial which was her old strategy. Since the cat's been out of the bag, I can tell she almost regrets sharing so much because she can't take it back. She's talked about how she would purge and how she'd lie to cover herself. I can tell she doesn't want to confront the issue and would rather nobody notice. But I notice everyday and it's killing me.

I feel like she's really hurting herself by working twice as hard at her jobs to try and distract herself and other people from the more important issue of her mental and physical well-being. I try to start conversations about it vaguely and tactfully and she typically says something about how nice I am for checking in then quickly tries to dance around the subject. I don't think she realizes I know she's purging again. What should I do? I feel like I'm just standing there watching her be incredibly self destructive while she's says things like: ""I'm fine, I'm just tired, I didn't get much sleep last night, I just ate earlier, I'm doing...*okay*.""

She's so busy all the time, she has more on her plate then anyone else I know. I'm afraid she's working herself to death. She wouldn't even know what to do with free time if she had any. She'd find more work to do. She isn't sleeping well, isn't drinking enough water, isn't eating enough, purging almost daily (just from what I can see). It's obvious she isn't well and I don't know what to do. She's an adult and will do what she'll do. I told her back when she first let me know how bad she was struggling that I would never try to force her to do anything but would always be there for support. I just feel so powerless and want to help, but I also don't want to force the issue and risk her pulling away and regressing further. Sorry for the ranting. What should I do? I can't solve her problems but I can't just watch her do this to herself while almost everyone else around her thinks she's just fine.",1533287465,8/3/2018 4:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9481sz/request_advice_about_confronting_a_friend_with_a/,2

I think a lot about food in the day, specially because I often don't cook it (my parents do), so I'm nervous about what are we going to eat, and think about if I should make up an excuse for not eating or just cook another thing, or eat a fruit for dinner.

For the record, he has no upper teeth at the moment (lost his dentures) so I know it's difficult for him to eat, but of course he uses this as an excuse to starve himself. When I do get him to eat, he makes himself throw up afterwards and thinks I don't know. He is malnourished, he is 50 and already in bad health so depriving himself of nutrients is not helping his condition. I want to help so bad but every time I bring it up he just starts joking about it, saying things like ""I haven't eaten since '86!"" But it's not funny :(. I've tried to teach him about diet and I've tried to better his relationship with food but he won't help himself.

344,98s758,Request: I Might Be Developing An ED And I Need Advice,"I’m scared that I might be developing an eating disorder.

A couple weeks ago, I started working out a couple times a week because I wanted to lose weight. I’ve always struggled with body issues, and I’ve never liked the way I look, so I thought losing weight would help with that.

The first weeks were great! I saw some progress and I was motivated to keep going, but it began to get more more difficult. I started counting calories to manage my weight loss plan more efficiently, but then I started becoming obsessed with counting my calories. I thought this was normal because I was more conscious of what I was eating, but last week I realized I was gradually developing more unhealthy thoughts.

My friends invited me out to eat, and part of me was excited to hang out with them, but another part of me did not want to go because I knew we would only be eating unhealthy things. I considered cancelling, but I forced myself to go because I missed my friends. I went out with them and had a good time. I didn’t think too much about the calories because I knew I wouldn’t be eating anything else that day besides desserts and a boba drink.

But then everything got so much worse a couple days ago. I went out to eat with my mom and ordered a salad, and I forgot to ask for it without dressing. When I picked up my salad and saw that it was covered in dressing, I felt sick. I tried my best to eat it, but just looking at it and thinking about the extra calories made me feel awful. Also, I began to think about how much junk food I ate when I hung out with my friends and I felt so guilty.

I was having a mental battle with myself and I kept telling myself that the extra calories didn’t matter because I have been very consistent with sticking to my diet and working out. But at the same time I was thinking that if I ate this salad, I would hate myself even more. I thought that I could just make myself throw up the salad later and everything would be alright. I immediately knew this was a bad idea and I shouldn’t even consider doing that because it’s unhealthy. I ended up ordering another salad without the dressing, and ate that one instead.

I realized that I could be developing an eating disorder because I was having these type of thoughts and ended up crying in the restaurant in front of my mom. I felt so awful and sick with myself.

This past weekend I decided to stop counting my calories and enjoy food that I like. I thought that would make me feel better, but it didn’t. Every time I ate something, all i could think about was how I as undoing the progress I’ve made and how much weight I was going to gain. I ate some of my favorite foods, and normally this makes me happy whenever I’m sad, but it didn’t. I went home that night and just cried myself to sleep because I was disgusted with myself. I wanted to throw it all up. I hated myself so much for eating all of that junk food. I felt absolutely horrible, but I didn’t throw up despite how much I wanted to. I couldn’t get the thoughts out of my head and had trouble sleeping.

Today was not much better. My dad invited me to a convention and there were tons of free food samples. I didn’t want to go, but he was excited that I was finally old enough to attend, so I went anyways. I ate some and I was having fun, but when we left I felt guilty again. I started having the same thoughts about wanting to throw up everything I ate.

I’m sorry this is long, but I really need some advice right now. I’m so scared that I’m going to succumb to these urges sometime soon.

I struggled with an ED for a few years as a teen, but until this year was mostly recovered. Earlier this year my depression, which never really improved, got worse and I lost my appetite. Without putting effort in or realizing at first I lost some weight, but when I did realize, I stared wanting to lose more weight and fell back into a lot of disordered eating habits. I started attempting to restrict more, but ended up just binging/ purging a bunch. Because of all the binging, I've actually gained weight and am pretty much at the weight I was earlier this year before my ED became active again. I didn't receive therapy or treatment for my ED in the past, but have been attempting to see a therapist recently. However, I kept getting referred away bc the therapists I went to didn't feel equipped to fully help me.  I was referred to an ED center and after their assessment, they recommended that I do their inpatient program. My deductible is $3000 and I would also have to take a month off of work. Also, because i'm not underweight and haven't actually been losing weight (even though I've been trying) I keep telling myself that my ED isn't bad enough to get treatment for. Especially because I would have to sacrifice so much to do inpatient. But, bc of b/p I've been super bloated and feel absolutely horrible and disgusted with myself constantly, which triggers me to try to restrict, which leads to more binge and purge. I know the only way to really make the bloating go away is to eat normally, by every time I eat, it turns into a binge. All I can think about is wanting to eat. Even when I attempt to eat a ""normal"" meal, I don't feel full after and still want to eat more. The ED center recommended a few therapists to me to attempt care at an outpatient level, but they aren't covered by my insurance. I feel like I'm in a weird limbo where I'm not getting help currently, but inpatient still does feel like an option, but I'm scared to put effort into stopping these behaviors now because by the time I'm able to do inpatient my ED won't be bad enough for help? And it's only really been active again for like half a year? I guess I'm looking for some words of encouragement or advice on how to feel more at peace or advice on inpatient/ anyone else's experience with inpatient.

I wasn't speaking to my therapist and just became so numb to everything. This year, I will be speaking to both my nutritionist and my therapist weekly; they will be able to monitor me and make sure I'm doing well.

My ED has been a constant in my life and I don't know what I'll be without it. I'm really excited for a life without ED as it can benefit me in so many ways...but at the same time, I'm afraid that if I don't have it, I'll gain weight, which I'm terribly afraid of.

Right now, I feel like I am struggling with everything.

For years, I was anorexic, then I went to treatment and reached a healthy weight again. I stopped going to therapy last year, and since then, I've lost a lot of weight. Been stable for a while, though, I believe. I eat a lot more than I used to, but deep down I know that I still don't eat enough. I don't know why I don't eat enough at this point; I like the way I look and I am a lot happier.

Yet, about once a week, occasionally twice, I binge/purge. It's always at night and it is always sweets. I sit in front of the TV and I eat a lot of food. Then, I start to feel uncomfortably full and ill at a certain point, and that's when I decide to throw up.

I don't know why I do it. It's like something comes over me or I turn my brain completely off. I don't think, I just eat to feel better, then I throw up. I have memory issues and I don't know if it's because of the anorexia; I couldn't tell you much about what I did the past few months. I don't remember what I did yesterday.

I don't know what's going on with me; I'm in a loving relationship, I'm finally out of school, my day-to-day life is hardly ever stressful. Why am I like this? How do I help myself? I can't go back to therapy; I feel like that experience was traumatizing and the experience of spilling my story out to another ""professional"" will also be traumatic.

I can't be bulimic because this isn't everyday. I'm not anorexic. I don't stand in front of the mirror and obsess; body image/self-image is usually good. I'm usually confident.

355,980wek,Request: What can I expect from residential as someone with both restrictive and binge-eating tendencies?,"After two eating disorder assessments, it was decided that residential is the best option for me. I’ll be deferring for the fall semester at university in order to focus on treatment and getting better.

While I was technically underweight at the assessment, I’ve basically been eating uncontrollably for the last week or so and am no longer underweight. Because of this, will they still focus on my restrictive tendencies? Will I have to “weight restore” at a healthy weight?

What is treatment like for those with BED at a residential site? Will they allow me to maintain my weight, given that my BMI is greater than 18.5? I have been dealing with secondary amenorrhea, will that be factored into the caloric and nutritional goals provided to me?

Is there any autonomy in meal choices? Will I always have to complete my meals, or is it more of a “go at your own pace” type of treatment?

Oh, and medication...I was told I could no longer continue Vyvanse due to my weight loss. If my food intake is being monitored, and I display willingness to meet my calorie goals, is there any chance it’ll be prescribed to me again? It was the only medication to have helped me in the past.

I’ll be at a Renfrew center, for reference. Really, any idea of what I could expect would be helpful. I’m leaving on Monday and my only understanding of residential treatments comes from a select few number of free British ED documentaries on YouTube.

358,9b7up8,Results from Online questionnaires interested in people’s experiences on Mental Health e-communities,"As you know, we post academic research participation recruitment requests from time. One of those researchers sent us the following note to share on the findings  from his master’s thesis research project:

Findings from previous study posted on Reddit that was entitled, “Online questionnaires interested in people’s experiences on Mental Health e-communities”.

The purpose of the study was to explore how online disinhibition, the tendency to act with fewer inhibitions when communicating over the internet, may be related to non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). There are two types of online disinhibition: benign and toxic. When individuals are benignly disinhibited they more readily express suppressed emotions or act with unusual kindness, whereas toxically disinhibited individuals tend to act more rudely and threatening (think internet “trolls”). The study looked at both benign and toxic disinhibition separately and together (i.e., total disinhibition).

It was found that individuals who actively discussed their NSSI online reported higher total online disinhibition compared to individuals who reported only reading about NSSI online, never having posted. Additionally, when exploring benign and toxic disinhibition amongst those who reported discussing NSSI online, a significant association was found between reported levels of toxic disinhibition and lifetime NSSI frequency. Specifically, higher reported levels of toxic disinhibition were associated with lower NSSI frequency. Further research is needed to more deeply understand this last finding.

Potential implications:

• Acting out online might curb NSSI urges for the individual who is toxically disinhibited. However, such actions could also negatively impact the e-communities in which they interact.

• Higher levels of total online disinhibition might impact other factors such as online syndication (use of the internet to find and associate with like-minded individuals) or online escalation (when a problem behavior becomes amplified through internet use). How these factors interact should be the subject of future research.

• Discussing the impact of online disinhibition within e-communities may serve beneficial as with awareness could come pause before submitting posts.

My husband has never been aware of food, if his mom made it, he ate it, that was all, he has always trained so he was normal.

When we got married, I tried to ""be normal"" and of course, that didn't last and also gained weight. I began fasting again and he did too, now he is obsessed with IF and keto, at the beginning I thought it was fine, but now we have been on a binge-fast cycle together and I see him frustrated, measuring everything, not eating for as prolonged periods of time as me or more, tired, weighing in every day, with more frustration about food than I've ever seen in him.

I'm really sorry if this is too long but I need to get it off my chest. My anorexia started my junior year of high school, in 2014. Before I ever struggled with an ED, I was overweight. Not in my head, but I was actually overweight. Doctors would tell me that I was overweight and needed to lose weight and it would crush my soul inside. Idk what switched in me, but one day I started a healthier lifestyle. However, as this usually goes, I overdid it and began developing disordered eating/fitness patterns which quickly snowballed into full-on anorexia. My WBC count was too low and my body had entered starvation mode. I was diagnosed by a doctor and was taken to a specific ED doctor. This absolutely horrified me as any form of treatment was a complete no from me. So I allowed myself to gain enough that my parents and doctors would be off my back.  

&amp;#x200B;

In 2015, I went vegan and this is where my recovery gets blurry to me. To me, when I went vegan, my ED was cured. And in a way, it really was. My blood levels were all perfect and what not because I was actually eating enough to be healthy. I always ate until I was completely full. But I only ate a couple of things, it was weird. I think this was a mask for my ED to thrive while hiding behind veganism although I am truly passionate about the movement. When I went to college, in 2016, I initially lost a lot of weight, not on purpose, but because there was no damn vegan food in the dining hall. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I made friends and got addicted to drugs, not a joke. This is where things get weirder. So, I started to gain a lot of weight, almost all the way up to my weight when I was overweight. It's because I was literally addicted to fentanyl and had no common sense at all, I stopped being vegan (I am still vegetarian to this day for ethical and environmental reasons, though) and would overeat because I was really really fucked up all the time. To clarify, I was addicted to Xanax. But the Xanax was fake and so i was really addicted to fentanyl.  

&amp;#x200B;

I  went through withdrawal in 2017 and have been sober ever since (over a year sober). I naturally lost some of the weight I gained because I wasn't shoving my face with junk-food 24/7.  And now I'm here today. Everything in my head wants me to go back to my ways even though I know I can't. I'm at a ""healthy"" weight but idk anymore. I'm starting to doubt if I've ever even been recovered from my eating disorder. I'm dealing with a lot of intrusive thoughts lately and I can't take it. I feel like I've been dealt too many mental illness cards and idk what even came first anymore. I have diagnosed ADHD, severe anxiety, I am an addict, doctors always think I'm bipolar, I've had an ED, depression, and I think I have PTSD. idk anymore i just don't know what to do and would really like some support please. I'm also prescribed medication for my ADHD which is a stimulant and makes everything so hard too because i never have an appetite.

Hi everyone, I'm posting this in here in hopes to get an answer that might help me. Quick history: I've always been underweight my whole life, but I've never had any problems eating, I used to love eating and most of the times would eat as much as anybody. At one point I started training, training to gain weight and eating sometimes 6 meals a day with no issues. 4\~5 months ago, I started puking a lot, I've never puked that many times in my life every time right after eating. This caused my to slowly stop eating (so stop training as well...) I started eating fewer and fewer meals until now when I literally eat once a day. Just dinner, no breakfast, no lunch, no snacks.. Water during the day and dinner when I get home. I've lost about 25 pounds during this period of time, where now I'm just barely in the normal BMI range. I did an ultrasound and an endoscopy for my stomach with biopsies and everything came back normal. I'm starting to think that maybe it's related to stress. Anyone had a similar thing? Or any tips to force for feed myself? Or any advice that might help?

365,9a9nir,Request: How Do You Deal With Emotional And Binge Eating?," 

I have disordered eating due to Autism/ADHD and executive dysfunction that comes with that (I can't maintain routines, which includes meal routines and making sure I always have suitable food), that can't really be helped, but my emotional eating and binge eating is potentially treatable.

I've always been a food fan but I started emotional eating to deal with depression - I've had depression a long time, but the eating seems to have been triggered by trauma via work (I work with high-risk child sex offenders and hear some fucking horrific stuff), I remember specifically giving myself 'permission' to eat junk instead of self-harming or risking suicide.

Now I eat junk whenever I feel down, it's almost like an excuse...but the more junk I eat the more junk I crave, I also find often when I eat junk I feel more depressed because I feel guilty or/and because I know I'll feel terrible due to what I've eaten - sometimes I feel full and sick straight away, but in general carb-heavy foods have a big negative impact (worsening autism traits, lethargic, bloated). Of course long-term I'm going to gain weight and suffer health problems too.

I'm on a waiting list for therapy but it's for depression specifically, sure it will help with this too but I would need to go back through the whole system and back on an even longer waiting list to get any help with this - I'm in the UK so it's via NHS, I've been waiting 26 weeks for CBT. That's assuming they'd help me, I'm not sue my eating is severe enough for it to be seen as a real problem, and I'm nowhere close to over or under weight.

I feel there's a lot of help for people who experience eating disorders like anorexia but not so much for disordered eating, emotional eating, and binge eating. I'm looking for self-help, essentially.",1535227058,8/25/2018 14:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9a9nir/request_how_do_you_deal_with_emotional_and_binge/,6
366,99yjwp,Request: How To Trust Your Hunger Again When Everytime You Do Your Worst Fears Come True?," 

Hi,

I am recovering from a restrictive ED.

It's always said that one should trust his own hunger, because the body will sort itself out. It's also always said that, when you do it, you become surprised of how much food you actually need to maintain your weight, and that your perception of what is ""normal"" was clearly warped by your ED.

Except that, in my case, it isn't true.

Every time I do eat what I want, even if it's not a very large amount, I gain weight more than what I had thought I would. It's like my ED is very good at counting what I need, and that in my case those pesky online calorie calculators are perfectly right, if not even on the upper end. And it's not just fluids or water weight: I am no longer underweight, I do not ""binge"" and this weight sticks for a long time, essentially until I restrict again. I am also already well above my previous weight, even though I had already completed my growth curve when the ED began (I became ill when I had already been a fully matured adult for several years, with a stable weight). All my labs are fine, I have no detectable hormonal imbalances, I am not underweight by any possible sense, my hair is fine, my thermal regulation is fine, my energy levels are fine.

I just can't eat that much. I mean, I so much desperately wanted to believe the story that ""my metabolism is suppressed"" and that I only needed to eat more; maybe I would have gained like a couple of pounds in the short term and then I would have started to maintain on a much larger intake and I would have finally relaxed around food, seeing that I could actually eat what I wanted without ballooning into obesity.

Yet it's not happened, and now I don't know what to do. If I do eat what I want my weight *actually* balloons, and I *actually* approach the overweight territory. There's no place where I can truly trust my hunger and let my body regulate itself. My metabolism has not magically revved up. I am just starting to believe that I will have to restrict my whole life.

Does anyone have advice for me?",1535125824,8/24/2018 10:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/99yjwp/request_how_to_trust_your_hunger_again_when/,8

371,99lyfi,Request: I Know This Is Not Normal. I Fear I Have An Eating Disorder.,"Hi!

I've been struggling with my weight my whole life, starting from being thin to being overweight, to thin, to athletic, overweight and now thin again. I'm only 19. I've been dieting and I'm close to my goal weight, although I have a lingering desire of pushing more for a lighter, new goal weight.

My current weight loss is the first, the longest and the only planned one I've ever had that actually work: the other one stemmed from a simple flu. Go figure!

My ""diet"" is not conventional, I believe: I eat a very low number of calories a day - a very large deficit - and then I """"""binge"""""" on the weekends. Still, these binges of mine aren't unplanned. I make the food, I organize them and then eat a maintenance day worth of food, although the vast majority of times I exceed by even that, because I decide to eat the leftovers or other thing I didn't plan on eating (so maybe they're not so-unplanned, after all?). I do IF and OMAD.

The problem lies here: when I'm full, I can't stop, I keep eating, to the point of feeling gross, bloated and incapable of moving comfortably. It doesn't matter whether I'm still bloated from the night before, I still eat more than I should on Sundays too.

In fact, my binge always begins on Saturday nights, when I'm sure no relative can disturb or interrupt me, especially given the fact I practically cover the table I eat at with food. My sister once saw me and was shocked. I was ashamed and embarassed.

I feel sick, sad and frustrated but I don't know how to break this cycle. I've been going through this since March (my weight loss began in January). I've lost weight at a rate of 0,4 kg (almost a pound) a week. I had two month-long plateaus, one lasting the entire month of March and the other one from late-June to late-July.

I can't bear thinking of eating healthy as I once did, not while dieting.

When my friends ask me to dine together during the week, I practically fast the days leading and following our dinner together, because of my constant fear of losing control; this has been my discipline: I punish/restrict myself during the week and then reward myself on the weekends. I often feel miserable and lethargic, both before and after my binges, and sometimes irritable, too (mainly on Saturdays, just before eating).

Because of this new eating habit, I haven't had my period for 4-5 months, and, before this, it'd always been regular.

I don't know whether it may add anything, but I part-time work as a food server for 25-30 hours a week and I'm a second year Chemistry undergraduate.

I've been lurking this subreddit and I find it odd how many things I find relatable, but perhaps I'm unconsciously overexaggerating.

I didn't say much at all for a long time. And I didn't eat. My coaches found out, and they noticed i wasn't doing anything in classes. I was depressed. Our athletic trainer would make me eat Gatorade energy gummies and personally bring me Gatorade during practice. I couldn't complete workouts.

Mom asked if I wanted to see someone to talk to and all I had to do was say no and she never asked again. I only ate around her to make sure she thought I was better. I talked to counselors at school but they never offered advice or paid attention to what I was saying.

376,9cxsmb,Request: Having difficulties with food and eating," I’m writing this tired and weak, I don’t have the energy to go into the details; we all have them but the gist of it is that for a couple of years I have revisited the disordered eating that I thought I left behind ten years ago when I was 18. I struggle with health anxiety and some sort of phobia of getting sick from food combined with comments made by people in my life for many years about being too skinny or too fat, or getting scolded for eating or living with people who made it impossible for me to use the kitchen. Now I am very underweight. I never wanted to be this thin, it’s never been an appearance thing. I also suffered from a trauma that left me unable to eat about two years ago which led to drinking and abusing marijuana which suppressed my appetite (convenient at the time since I was too afraid to use the kitchen publicly and I had little money for food because I was spending it on marijuana and not working). What a mess. In any case, I want to get better. My hunger cues are out of whack but improving, my digestion is a mess and anxiety producing; I just want to be my old self again.

My question is, even though it’s not about being thin, why is that I get hungry now, get excited about the food, eat the food, feel unwell, and then become very anxious and start having momentary suicidal thoughts? They pass once the discomfort passes but my gut is all messed up from not eating or a recent accidental alcohol poisoning. I’m taking digestive enzymes and probiotics, I have an appointment with a doctor, and I am dedicated to recovery. But I feel guilty for not working, for being so sick in bed while everyone around me works and probably wonders why I’m so useless. This is a hell. I’m alone and scared and I don’t want to lose people I love because I’m crazy or not working but I am so weak physically at the moment and I don’t want to burden anyone so I take on activities and chores and favors and lend people what little money I have in an effort to prove I can contribute to the world and therefore not be abandoned. I have lots of issues. I want to trust my body. Why won’t it let me love myself? Why are my emotions out of control? Why can I go days and days without eating? It wasn’t always like this. I recovered and now I’ve relapsed. It’s like I get hit by everything; anxiety, depression, perfectionism, ocd with various things that come and go (sometimes it’s obsessive cleaning, where I won’t let myself eat until the whole house is perfect, or sometimes it’s paranoia about food and what people think. I’m just admitting this. Can I trust my body? Does it hate me? Does my mind hate me? Who is waging war on whom? I’m shattered into so many parts.

I logged what I could’ve eaten, and I felt really happy. I was going to take control and lose weight. But I didn’t consistently log. I started doing something more dangerous. I barely ate at all. i went to therapy a few times for something unrelated (I don’t have any mental illnesses, i just went because of a bad event in my life that made my mom want me to go.) and my therapist said there are two types of people: ones who eat a lot when stressed and ones who barely eat when stressed.

Hi, the idea that I may have a eating disorder has been weighing on my mind recently, somewhat due to infrequent prompts from parents and friends.

I'm a 19 yo UK male, without using numbers, my BMI puts me as severely underweight as per DSM-5 categories, but I have always been tall and skinny and probably classified as underweight but do weight less than a few years ago.

I had my bloods and an ecg taken in July for an unrelated issue (fainting) which was unresolved. The bloods found no irregularities in electrolyte levels, liver and kidney function, nor the thyroid. The ecg found some arrhythmias which did not worry my GP who claimed they were very common in young men.  
Recently I have had a lot of difficulty sleeping and fatigue during the day, probably related, and a marked drop in libido. I often take a mild stimulant to counter this and and to help when revising for exams. I have been feeling the stress of retaking my uni exams and my finances. I have been losing weight very slowly over the year the rate which I believe started when I started my intense period of revision.

I've never lost weight on purpose but do miss meals fairly frequently, mostly through habit and lack of appetite, I can easily go morning through to supper without eating. However when I have my evening meal, I eat a lot and until I am full. My family eats healthily and I don't eat any junk food. I don't see myself as fat or overweight, I think I look pretty damn good tbh, and in fact I'd like to gain some weight, the correct way, to become more muscular but I see no logic in gaining weight for the sake of gaining weight. However I must admit I get a ego little boost from seeing the numbers drop and looking at myself in the mirror.

Sorry for the monologue, here are my main questions,

Is my weight an issue even with normal bloods and ecg? Is BMI a reliable measure for my build or can it be safely ignored?

Can I have anorexia or an eating disorder when I don't think I'm fat?

381,9cpz5h,"Request: Welp, it’s back."," 

Ever since I was young I had issues with bulimia and anorexia. Body image was huge as my mom was always on some diet or another and I grew up fat. Mysteriously in middle school during health classes I learned about ED and went full swing. Parents found out, I tried committing suicide to not deal with the shame, was hospitalized first for the attempt then for the ED. Made a solid but slow recovery and never thought about it for years.

Fast forward to my mid 20s I’m in the best shape of my life. My ED never crossed my mind. Fast forward to being with my fiancée. I love her to death and cannot imagine my life without her. But when we started dating she was very clingy (since gotten very good about things) but I stopped eating healthy and exercising normally. I ate out all the time, didn’t work out, and started to hate myself again.

Things went down that slow roll as they normally do. I even tried to just accept that’s what happens in life. Then we got engaged and she wanted to lose weight for the wedding (as she gained 20lbs herself during the course of our relationship thus far). So my life once again was hyper focused on calories and watching myself. I began only able to see calories instead of meals. Then about 3 months before the wedding she gave up on her diets (until she went hardcore fasting mode that one month beforehand). And during that off time she always wanted to eat bad, eat dessert, ice cream, etc. and I just couldn’t deal with it. I started throwing up in secret again.

Now I find myself months later...every few days throwing up after an especially large meal or dessert. At this point I think I’m developing some cuts in my mouth and my throat is sore. I’m back to square one (though at least I’m not back to my lowest weight (I’m a 5’11” man btw) and still just coasting at a normal level).

I don’t know. Not asking for help. Just admitting what’s wrong to someone that’s not my me. I’m lethargic, depressed, my chest, back, and throat hurt, and upset with myself. The mouth pain is what really gets me emotionally. I haven’t felt that in 13 years.",1536014558,9/3/2018 17:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9cpz5h/request_welp_its_back/,1

383,9cpy07,Request: Long-Term Health Effects From ED?," 

Hello, I am in my mid-twenties and have been successfully recovering from an eating disorder that involved restricting, purging, and abusing diet pills/laxatives for almost 3 years now with only a few short-lived relapses. I feel good about myself and my body and I’ve been working through therapy to deal with the anxiety and control issues that I believe were a main cause of my ED. My problem has now turned from mental to completely physical. Even though I no longer carry the psychological hang ups about food, my appetite is almost nonexistent on some days and I have the tendency to vomit (unintentionally) very very easily. I’ve seen a gastroenterologist to make sure it’s not something physiological but I still have so much shame for my ED that I didn’t bring it up in the doctors visit. The doctor found nothing to warrant this kind of stomach unrest. I sort of bumbled and muddled through my recovery on my own so I still don’t have a lot of knowledge or support on the true effects of EDs. At the moment I’m self-medicating with marijuana (I live in a decriminalized county) but I eventually want a job that will most likely drug test, and regardless, I’m not keen on being dependent on any substance.

I suffered from EDs in some form or another from ages 13-23ish. Did I permanently ruin my body’s ability to enjoy food? Is it more likely that I am just subconsciously still suffering from my ED? When I do eat, I eat healthily (vegetarian- meat almost always messes with my stomach) and I exercise on a regular basis. I am trying to get back up to a healthy weight so I can start building muscle, but I can’t seem to force myself to eat enough to stay a healthy weight.

I don’t want to be haunted by this for the rest of my life. Thank you.

385,9boefk,Request: My girlfriend has Binge Eating Disorder and I don't know how to express my feelings while still being supportive," 

In the last two months, my SO has been experiencing worse than normal  binges. It occurs every day she is at home if I am not with her. We  live separately, so she usually is home alone each day for at least a  little after work or at night if I leave to sleep separately.

The aftermath of her binges brings a lot of sadness and negativity  into both of our lives. She will be irritable, emotionally unstable, and  needy since she feels horrible about doing it. After she binges I will  come over, potentially the next day if she does it after I leave at  night, we spend anything from 10 minutes to a couple hours working  through her emotions. If we attempt to avoid it, issues crop up  throughout the day until we do. 

To be supportive, I never harp on the details of her binge or make  her feel guilty of letting me down. I have let her known several times  that her actions do affect me negatively though. It's not the direct act  of bingeing, but all of the downstream effects that are hard for me. 

I have asked her to get more help and all she was willing to do was  attend her regular therapy sessions once a week instead of bi-weekly. We  had a long conversation where she said that I have to trust her  decision to not use different means of help. She says that stretching  her thin across other support groups/specialists will actually make  everything worse for our relationship because it will increase her  stress level which causes both bingeing and relationship problems. I  need to be patient and let her face her problems at her own pace. I  understand and respect her choice.

So now we are at a point where I need to be patient and let things  get better, but it is really bringing me down. I selfishly don't know if  I can stay with her through all of this, but telling her that can't be  the right solution. Her biggest childhood problems stemmed from the fact  that she was punished for bingeing and me telling her I would leave if  she doesn't ""improve"" would fit right in that vain.

What can I tell her that makes it clear that I can't handle  everything for much longer without causing the relationship to implode?

For around 6ish years I've been a major binge-eater. When I was younger it didn't occur to me what it was because I was a kid and kids eat junk. Plus, I was an athlete so I was always super fit &amp; felt good.

However, once I graduated HS I realized how bad my eating habits are because I'm not working out for 4-5 hours every day like I used to and my metabolism has slowed. I constantly obsess over my legs (if they look like my muscle has been replaced with fat or if my cellulite is prominent when I'm sitting) and my face (I'm convinced the area under my chin is fatter now).

I used to throw up every once in a while after binging bc of how gross I felt. Luckily I've kicked that habit. I just can't seem to stop eating junk &amp; constantly searching it out (even going out of my way to get it) though.

I'm determined to get myself right but don't know where to start. If anyone has any advice that worked for them, that'd be much appreciated.

388,9ew0j4,Request: Conflicting opinions about recovery requirements and weight," 

I'm being completely engulfed by feelings of chaos, and really need some advice.

I'll try to cut a long story short: my sister is 2 years younger than me, and has just been declared recovered after serious anorexia (she was so underweight she wasn't allowed to walk, but was in a wheelchair, and was hospitalised for three months).

I am an athlete, and a few months ago I had to admit to myself that against all odds, I am actually struggling with food and body image. I lost a bit of weight: it was visible but not dangerously low. My family were immediately very concerned, and at first I brushed them off. But then I had a serious think about what was going on, and decided I probably did need to gain some weight, if anything just to prove that I could. That's when I realised I really didn't like that, and struggled with a lot of self-hate. I consulted a doctor.

I'm currently on the waiting list for CBT at an eating disorder clinic. I've been trying to eat normally, forcing myself to when I don't really want to. I struggle with the problem of seeing different things in mirrors every time, and being constantly aware and critical of my body.

My family had an intervention for me, telling me I need to work hard to put on weight again, for my mind to get better. I admitted that I knew there was a problem, and that I am in fact getting help. I agreed to actively gain weight.

But here is the problem: my boyfriend, also an athlete, said he doesn't understand why I have to put on weight to get better. My weight is normal, if I had always looked that way, no one would have batted an eyelid. And now I can't get that out of my head - why do I have to put on weight? The thought of gaining weight terrifies me and I really don't want to (which in itself is an obvious sign of disorder). But can I stay ""fit"" and still recovery mentally?

i’m currently in a partial hospitalization program for my eating disorder and after a few weeks of treatment my dietician and psychiatrist have both suggested that i have arfid- that diagnosis feels to me that it fits me really well especially because i am on the autism spectrum and have adhd which are both common in arfid -except for one major thing- in all the research i’ve done on arfid they are really pushing that arfid has nothing to do with a desire to lose weight and body image issues. i feel as a child those factors weren’t a part of my avoidance/restriction of food but through my teenage years and now into my early 20s i am very obsessed with losing weight and my body image issues are overwhelming and intense. i feel as if what i have is more of a combination of arfid and anorexia because of a few things- 1.) my extreme desire to lose weight and be as thin as possible 2.) the extreme sense of pride i feel surrounding my ability to starve myself for long periods of time 3.) my constant body checking 4.) since being in treatment my fear of gaining weight keeps me up at night, is a huge obstacle to my recovery, and is just overall debilitating. 5.) my restriction is both centered around sensory issues, food making me feel sick, fear of choking of vomiting, and incredibly picky eating. but also my restriction is also very focused on trying to lose weight and that has played a significant role in my eating disorder as well

every single article i’ve read about arfid is very incessant that it has nothing to do with body image or the desire to be thin/ lose weight.

what i’m wondering is if there is anyone out there who also relates to having both arfid and more anorexic symptoms because reading about arfid is making me really anxious that i don’t fit into either category according to the dsm but to me it feels like i fall into both. i’m trying to take treatment as seriously as possible and i’m going to discuss my fears on this topic with my team but i would love to here from anyone one else who may relate in some way",1536571966,9/10/2018 4:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9elif3/reuest_arfid_coinciding_with_body_image_issues/,1

Hello, hope everybody is doing well. I'm a 20-year old male in college. I'm tall and thin. And for some reason, I can't stop worrying about my weight.

I've always been known as the ""tall, lanky"" kid by family, friends, and other people I come across, and lately, I panic every time my stomach looks bigger and feel like I need to cut down on what I'm eating. It's gotten to the point where I'll finish a meal and instantly tell myself that I shouldn't have eaten that much and I need to be better. I go out of my way to take the stairs more, or walk the longer route around campus, or spend my time on my computer looking how many calories (blank activity) will burn.

I also have a bad habit with calorie counting now. It started last spring, when a close friend started monitoring his for weight loss. Our cafeteria has the calories in a dish listed on a sign next to where you get said dish, and for some reason, I started obsessing over what that number was. I was worried that I was gaining weight, you could see my stomach sticking out in my clothing, and that people would judge me because the ""skinny kid is getting bigger,"" and I started monitoring calories like crazy. I'm still doing it now. I tried to cut it over the summer and felt better for a few weeks, but I'm back at school now and it's continued. It's gotten to the point where I think I'm eating around 1700-1800 a day, and like I said earlier, I get frustrated with myself if I eat too many in one meal.

I've also started working out and running more, exercising 5 days a week instead of 2-3 like I used to. This seems like a good thing, but I know I'm just doing it because I'm so preoccupied with the food I'm eating and I want my stomach to go down. Sometimes I get so fed up and decide I'm being ridiculous that I'll try to snack or eat more than usual, but that leads to me getting more frustrated.

This morning I had a big breakfast which was delicious at the time, but I immediately regretted it, and made myself have a 400-calorie lunch and a 250-calorie dinner.

I'm really starting to worry. Any tips on whether this is an ED, or how to stop worrying about calories and body image in general?

So far I have only read informational resources of the NEDA (National Eating Disorder Association) in form of a 73 Page PDF.

I would like to get some input to further understand my boundaries and limits as of how far I can involve myself and for example, if I am in the position to ask her, to at least take down the pictures she posts on that Instagram account since they are mainly nudes only covering her face.

What can I do and what shouldn't I do? Because at this point it is really stealing my sleep at night and I even catch myself from time to time, being angry at her. I never expressed that feeling in front of her and I don't plan on doing so, but I really start to struggle as I am living with a bipolar personality disorder myself. I want to stay strong for her, but I need help and a vent to talk about it...

If more information is needed, I can give an insight on habits and behaviors. But I would like to keep it as inoffensive as possible.

If I formulated something in an inappropriate way, I apologize up front and will change the context immediately. For any help and tips, I would like to thank everyone in advance.",1536283770,9/6/2018 20:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9dpg7p/request_my_loved_one_has_an_ed_i_need_someone_to/,7
400,9dpfnq,Request: How to approach/help someone who might have an eating disorder," 

I've been dating someone for a couple of weeks and I'm starting to suspect she might have/had problems related to eating. We've never discussed it in specific, but we have talked about her past problems with depression/self harm.

She is very skinny. I'm not a doctor but I'd say she's probably over the line where it's unhealthy. Some days, all she eats is some fruit - definitely way less than what is healthy for someone in her physical shape (or anyone, for that matter).

I've never approached her about it, or tried to help, except by trying to be supportive in general. What I've done so far is to be very careful to not comment on her body or her portions/eating habits. Sometimes she brings it up and it feels almost like bait. For example she could send me a picture of a few sliced up apples, saying it's what she'll have for lunch.

As you probably have realized, I don't know enough to say anything for sure, so I'm just asking how I should handle the situation. I obviously want her to eat more, simply because she's very skinny and I'm afraid she'll collapse, but I'm also afraid I'll trigger something bad which worsens the situation.

Thank you.",1536283654,9/6/2018 20:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9dpfnq/request_how_to_approachhelp_someone_who_might/,13

402,9dgs07,Request: Anyone wanna tell me I'm gonna be OK?," 

I got sick in 2015 with a bad stomach ulcer but didn't know what was wrong with me and gained 25 lbs - sometimes when you get an ulcer the pain mimics hunger and I was ravenous and couldn't stop eating. Before that my body was ""perfect"" and I actually did like it, I was fairly thin with big boobs but all the sudden nothing fit. All the taunts from my sisters over the years of SOMEDAY YOURE GONNA BE FAT came back to haunt me in a big way. I became terrified of eating, I couldn't even trust my own body to tell me when I was hungry. Food became the enemy. I started a serious diet and ate the base minimum calories to exist. I cried all the time thinking I was never going to eat anything I liked again. I started working out religiously, I poured over details of online weight loss tips. I dedicated myself to it one hundred percent - then I found out that my problems were being caused by said ulcer. I started taking meds and continued my psychotic workout regiment. After only a few shorts months, the ulcer went away and my normal digestion returned with a vengeance soon after. I dropped weight rapidly and all the sudden I was very underweight. My ribs jutted out. I lost two cup sizes practically overnight and when my bras stopped fitting - I realized I needed to stop.

Now, three years later, I still have not been able to gain back the weight. I continue to have a messed up relationship with food and my anxiety and self loathing doesn't help at all. I used to like the way I looked, I liked my boobs a lot and now theyre gone and Im so sad all the time. My ribs are still showing in between my breasts and when I wore a low cut dress on vacation with my family my mom said I looked like a Holocaust victim. I hate the way that I look now, I cant believe I ever thought that this was the goal. That being sick looked attractive. Now I stare at other girls on the street with boobs and I hate, hate, hate myself for what I did to, myself.

Im new to this and have never spoken in detail of it online, or anywhere. I want to ask if theres any hope for my body to go back to the way it was before. I really miss my breasts so much and Im tired of seeing my ribs and having people think that Im sick still, even though arguably, I am. I dont workout anymore because it terrifies me. I know this is bad and that I really should get back into it but I dont want to lose any more weight and I just want someone to help me get back on track.

405,9dgq2z,Request: Tips On Eating When You Feel Like Shit?," 

I used to(?) be bulimic with restrictive habits, and it really wrecked my hunger signals. Please let me know if any of this is inappropriate elaboration, but I regularly struggle with only realizing it's been too long when it's too late to avoid throwing up on an empty stomach. I don't want that to come across as anything resembling ""restriction bragging"" because it's not, it's fucking awful and I hate it. I feel so sick constantly. I get stuck in hours of cycling between trying and failing to keep food down.

I'm not thin; I'm usually at a healthy weight but overweight right now. So part of me feels like I should be embarrassed that this is even an issue at all. Clearly I eat enough, right?

But it's all or nothing. I eat compulsively (basically when I'm high), I eat when I'm with other people, and I eat when I remember I either have to do it or vomit soon.

I don't enjoy food. I can't even taste it much anymore, without a sense of smell. I don't know what my favorite food is. I don't even know anymore what foods I genuinely like. Everything is messy and unappealing. I want to be vegetarian if not vegan, because meat is viscerally horrifying, but I'm not back on my bullshit enough to think that I can cut out most foods and have it go well.

My go-to solution has always been ""liquid calories!"" when I need a last resort before my stomach goes to shit. But I'm just...so tired of yogurt and protein drinks. They taste like my disorder at this point. I opened a yogurt up today and threw up instead because the idea of eating it made me cry.

What do you eat when your whole body hurts and nothing seems doable? Do you have any advice on eating it? Is sticking with tiny pieces a reasonable angle of attack, or does that sound like a bad road to go down?

Are there any easy-to-eat liquid-ish meals that aren't soup, yogurt, or a protein shake? Not smoothies.

In light of my weight, is it possible that everything is just fine now and I'm just looking for a reason to pretend I can't eat so I can fall back into my bullshit? If so, how do you address that?

I know the obvious answer is to just stuff literally any food in my face and accept that I'm going to lose my shit over it, but I can't trust that it'll stay down and I can't keep throwing up. My teeth are not okay.

I don't know what to do about food.",1536225913,9/6/2018 4:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9dgq2z/request_tips_on_eating_when_you_feel_like_shit/,4
406,9dgppt,"Request: Problems With ED ""Validation"" (See Content) And Living Life On The Fence"," 

So I think it's fair to say that my eating habits and mental approach to food have been up and down and around for the past several years. The most severe it got was a 6 month period over 2 years ago where I was pretty much on a starve-binge-purge cycle. But I managed to get myself out of that, mostly. So now to the sticking point: because I've never felt like I had a valid/legit/authentic/whatever ED (oh, the joys of mental illnesses)--I never told anyone, always told myself that I'm not /really/ struggling, that there are people doing far worse--I don't think I've ever been really able to escape the general miasma of EDs. Outwardly, now, I seem fine--I eat regularly, don't purge any more, don't exercise much, etc. But I know I'm still broken mentally--internally screaming at myself as I eat, still doing the math on calories, still full of envy when I see skinny people, still feeling bad in my own skin. I guess that, since it was never really acknowledged as a problem by me or anyone else, I don't know how to help myself in this regard. I don't need anything drastic. I've thought about joining an ED counselling group at my school and similar stuff, but again, I feel so... inadequate, because I haven't gone nearly as far or suffered nearly as much as so many ED people have. But I also know that I need to somehow get out of this semi-ed/semi-normal limbo I've been in for the past several years.

Sometimes, though, I spend a good bit of time in silence because I am unsure what to say. In a worst-case scenario, I am afraid that I could come off as insensitive, or say something that might be really damaging (the damage will probably be limited, since we do have a professional facilitator). More often, I have a thought that I'm just not sure how to verbalize. Or I'm not sure whether or not to broach a topic. Or I'm not sure how much detail I ought to provide in the stories I tell.

414,9fnirw,Request: Advice for how to support girlfriend with possible eating disorder,"In asking this question, I understand that a true diagnosis can only be made by a healthcare professional, therefore I'm simply looking for support and opinions from those with experience. I've been dating my girlfriend for around a year now and in that time I have noticed some very troublesome signs. She has told me about previously being diagnosed with bulimia and other issues she has faced around eating disorders. It was quite apparent upon meeting her that she was very underweight. It was soon into the relationship that she told me she checked herself out of the rehabilitation type program she was undergoing, once she was of legal age. She has told me on multiple occasions that she no longer suffers from any eating disorders, however the signs I have noticed possibly suggest otherwise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I notice that my girlfriend will almost never eat around me, unless said food is plain salad, e.g tomatoes / lettuce. This sign is generally the most difficult for me to deal with, as spending the day with her can feel more like I am depriving her of food, watching her energy levels slowly decline. I have on occasion noticed her appear to eat other calorie dense foods, however each time I have seen her discard this into a napkin under disguise of wiping her mouth or discretely discarding the food when she thinks I'm not looking. In the time we have been together, I have never seen her eat or even taste anything containing ANY sugar or oils, but she will buy these products to take home when we grocery shop together. When I ask if she would like to try and food or beverage I have that contains sugar, there is always the excuse of teeth sensitivity towards sugar or dairy products upsetting her stomach. S

&amp;#x200B;

econdly, I've noticed A LOT of food stored in her bedroom, often hidden from view or masked with things such as bed sheets or hidden in wardrobes. When we go shopping, she buys a lot of calorie dense foods such as bread, eggs, butter etc, however these purchases are often made under excuses that she is buying for friends and family too. On a short vacation together, she would often get up in the middle of the night and say she was going to read or something similar. One night, due to my suspicious, I got up and went to find her locked away in the  bathroom with the toilet continuously flushing. Large amounts of food had been made (way too much for one sitting) and when I went to see her, there was no food in sight once she opened the locked door. Once inside, I discretely opened some storage boxes in the room, into which was a huge amount of open food she had clearly been eating. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main concern with these signs, is that I may be seriously deteriorating her health, preventing her from eating simply by spending time with her. Since the start of the relationship, she has lost a significant amount of weight. The relationship is very serious and we're both very committed but I fear for the future. I constantly worry about whether or not we will be able to experience such things as living together successfully, as this would disrupt her routines of eating in private and hiding foods. If we ever go out to a cafe and I order food, I constantly feel guilty and get the sense that my eating saddens her, despite her saying otherwise. I am at a loss for how to deal with this situation. I fully understand how difficult mental health conditions can be, experiencing anxiety and depression myself and I do not expect her to just snap out of it, but I don't know how I can support her or even encourage any kind of recovery. I feel like any minor questions I have asked in the past regarding the topic have simply offended her and led to her being more secretive about her eating habits, such as trying to appear to eat more ""unhealthy"" foods before discretely discarding them without swallowing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated on how to handle the situation and even just how to discuss it with her without destroying the future of the relationship.",1536885828,9/13/2018 19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9fnirw/request_advice_for_how_to_support_girlfriend_with/,3

Here's my issue: I'm a 5'5 female and in the normal weight range. As far as I can tell, I am not underweight nor am I close to being underweight, medically speaking. I have a goal weight that's 10-15 pounds lower, still in the normal  BMI range  (and I have had that goal for a very long time). For some context, I started losing weight approximately 2 years ago and I'm down a total of \~60 lbs. I have had no trouble maintaining when I want to, and I am very slowly losing weight at this time by eating slightly less than my TDEE most days. I still want to get to that weight, and I am very confused if this is ""unhealthy"" now that I might have a formal eating disorder according to a professional.

Something I should add, is that my ""eating disorder"" thoughts/behaviors are triggered whenever I'm anxious/depressed/angry. I fight the ""bad"" emotions with ""good"" emotions, which I get from restrictive eating patterns and compulsively weighing myself. My boyfriend suggested moving our scale and I cried last night, so there's that. I know I have a problem, but I don't see why that should stop me from getting to my goal weight (since I'm not underweight).

So, my question is, in your opinion, is it unhealthy for me to continue to lose weight if I'm not underweight, just because a professional thinks I have anorexia?

She was forced into rehab by her parents as a teenager and the whole experience sounds horrific. I fear that experience is keeping her from believing that recovery is possible as an adult. I love her, but it's difficult to commit my life to someone who is killing themself. I have dealt with addiction in the past. Myself, my friends, and my parents have all had addiction problems. I'm aware that bulimia is an addiction cycle, so while i don't get it, i get it.

We have had a lot of serious talks regarding our future lately. She occasionally talks about wanting to get healthy. I have recently told her that i need to see some type of progress if our relationship is to continue. Something as small as looking for a therapist or joining a support group. I don't expect any quick progress and shes aware of that, but i need to see something. My mother chose addiction over me as a child and I honestly feel a similarity with my girlfriend. I love her and she's beautiful, but i can't watch her deteriorate in front of me.

A couple questions.

She believes the only way to recover is with inpatient or outpatient treatment. She told me that its impossible to recover by yourself. She says she will be forced to eat 4000 calories a day wont be allowed to work out. Is this true?

Her biggest fear is putting on a lot of weight in recovery. She keeps saying that she will put on a lot of weight. Do most people really experience that much of an initial weight gain?

How long does it take a metabolism to catch up to a set point weight?

I became obese after being put on an anti-psychotic for my depression(for mood stabilizing, again), and after I complained of being tired all the time, the doctor prescribed me abilify. I am far more alert with abilify, but now I realize after a month or so my night eating started. I am semi-conscious when I start raiding my fridge to find anything to eat - I wake up with empty bags of food beside my bed. I've been struggling so badly to address this problem, tried everything from fasting for weeks to working out right before going to sleep, because I am putting on even more weight with the syndrome. I blamed myself for not having control, but it seems like it's something that requires treatment, not just a will power.

The problem is that she has to comment on EVERYTHING I eat.

If she sees a plate in the sink one morning, or wrappers in the trash, she asks me if I had a midnight snack. She points out when I open a package of something - we went grocery shopping thing weekend and I opened a package of cookies we bought and she had to point it out. She’ll even try to guess what I ate by whatever “evidence” she finds. If I make a snack for myself, she’ll make a big deal that I didn’t make some for her. If I want to eat something, she has to join too. If I make something healthy like a salad or roasted chickpeas or something, she’ll be like “you’re having that while I’m having ice cream?!” as if she’s embarrassed, not realizing that she’s actually embarrassing me.

I think part of it is that I’m the one in the household that really tries to eat healthy, have a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too much processed sugar and stuff, takes the time to grow veggies in my garden and cook balanced meals, and she could never bother with all that. So she likes to point out everything I eat as a way of trying to catch me red-handed or something. I don’t know.

421,9ibih0,Request: Unsure If I Have Disorder Eating Behaviors And Where To Go From Here,"Background: I was considered obese by BMI standards in December 2016 and am now in the healthy range.

There’s been a couple of times where I have thought to myself “maybe I have an eating disorder?” But then I would think “no. I don’t have an eating disorder. There’s no way” but the more I look into the symptoms the more I feel like I relate to them. Not sure if I actually do or my mind is trying to convince me. 1. I always look at the calories in food. Even at the grocery store and it will be the deciding factor on if I buy something. 2. If my boyfriend wants to go eat somewhere, I HAVE to look up the nutrition facts for that restaurant online and spend a lot of time looking at all the calorie counts and deciding what to get. Sometimes I’ll even decide that I’m not going to get anything at all but I’ll go if he wants to go. 3. I have been counting calories for about 21ish months now. I continue to do it even though I reached my “goal” 4. I lost the weight by restricting to the bare minimum calories I need in a day and by exercising A LOT. Like even when I felt exhausted and unmotivated. I still exercise 6 days a week, but I am no longer restricting my calories that much but am still counting and worrying about eating too much. 5. I feel like if I’m at home, I am more likely to sit and snack on something even if I have just eaten. So I try to avoid being at home until the end of the day. 6. I keep track of what I eat throughout the day and then when I’m going to have my “final meal of the day” I get so panicked about what I should be eating that often times I decide not to eat at all and go to bed. 7. In situations like the one above^ I have also resorted to flipping a coin to decide what or when or if I should eat. 8. I weigh myself every morning and feel absolutely awful if my weight goes up in the slightest. I feel the need to eat less that day to account for the increase in weight. 9. I constantly criticize myself when looking in the mirror. My boyfriend will insist that I look amazing, but I just can’t see it. I am healthy weight, however I feel as though I need to continue to lose weight. Some days are worse than others though. Some days I think I look fine and some days I end up just sitting there and staring at myself and feel awful. 10. I get so anxious if I miss a workout. I seriously get worried that I’m going to gain weight if I miss one little part of my workout.

There is probably more that I am just missing right now but I think that covers most of it. I have purged a couple times in the past (about 4 years ago) when I was going through a rough patch and was not eating a lot. I just want to be able to enjoy food and not feel bad for enjoying foods and not be worrying about how many calories I have left for the day. I feel terrible when I eat something I shouldn’t but I also love eating things I shouldn’t. I guess this is where I admit I have an issue but just not sure where to go from here.",1537733640,9/23/2018 15:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9ibih0/request_unsure_if_i_have_disorder_eating/,4

423,9hkinc,Request: Having difficulty eating,"So i had a pretty bad childhood whit food. I'm from a tradition russian familiy and all my parents knew back when were things that just"" make u filled"" regardless of taste. So when i grew up not in my parents native country and eating their ""filling"" familiy's food and the local tasty fast food offered by Mc Donalds, Burger King( burger consisted of only meat, bread and tomato sauce) etc. I disliked literally every ingredient that was in my familiy's food and won't eat most of it even now ( ~15y later). That includes around 90% of vegetables, 80% of fruits and ""normal"" ingredients like cheese, salad,onions.... Back then my eating style was mostly unhealty and i also tried to change it but my body created that weird fuction that if i got something that i don't like in my mouth, i get exactly 3 gag reflexes before i throw up. That coupled with my parent's being the stubborn sort i often went without dinner or 8 hours at the table. Sometimes i got a litte beat up with the belt when my father lost it but it still didn't change that i couldn't get it down my stomach. After around 5 years of loud ""discussions"" with my family they one day realised that my eating disorder isn't going to get cured by their extreme behaviour and they just let me eat what i wanted which was pretty nice but still blame every cough or sickness because of my eating style (mostly unhealthy) and my gaming addiction ( kinda goes hand in hand, right?). Nowdays i try to eat things i didn't know before or looks interesting to me with things i normally dislike but my body still recognises the taste, consistency and generally ""knows"" of it's own accord what ingredient is used for the dish and let's me gag.

I'm really at the end of ideas about this problem even tho i know that i propably won't live past 40 with this kind of eating style. Can somebpdy provide help?",1537489462,9/20/2018 19:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9hkinc/request_having_difficulty_eating/,2

(I've learned to forgive myself for binge eating so its much easier to deal with these days)

This brings me to my current problem. Since breaking up with my SO 1.5 weeks ago, I have had no appetite. I didn't worry about it at first because this usually only lasts a day or half a day, but now its getting to the point where I'm forgetting to think about food, and when I do try to eat my stomach physically revolts and I feel ill. I love it, but I hate it. I have no energy. I'm also afraid that if I start eating again it will trigger a HUGE binge.

429,9kzp4y,"Request: I may be anorexic and I had unprotected sex, I'm worried but I also think I may be infertile anyway.","I need help but I wasn't sure where to ask, this seems like the best place because people here generally have experience with eating disorders. Apologies if this doesn't belong here since it's also related to sex/pregnancy.

I went to treatment for anorexia two years ago, at the time I was severely unhealthy/underweight which needed treatment. Prior to that, I'd been struggling for years.

This year, I am still underweight, but I have good body image and food is not something I obsess over; yet I may still have a problem, because I don't eat enough. I just work and don't eat for hours, or I spend hours playing a game/talking to a friend or my new boyfriend, so eating is the last thing on my mind. Usually I just throw things together, and I know I'm not getting enough calories in. :/ I barely feel hungry and I don't know why.

My period has been irregular this year. I think I've only gotten it three times but I can't remember. Two years ago, I got a bone scan and was told my bones were already in very bad shape, likely from years of malnourishment. I also had to be on estrogen for a while.

That's the only medical symptom I have. I'm underweight but not severely and I seem to have looked the same for months anyway, I'm not dizzy and I still have energy, no chest pains, no lanugo, etc. No preoccupying thoughts, it's like I've just lost interest in food or get distracted.

I had unprotected sex last week. I was fully aware of the risks and still am. He pulled out. So I guess in this post I am worried about two things...1) that I may still have an eating disorder 2) that I could still get pregnant, but I also feel like it's ""impossible"" for me to get pregnant since I already messed up my body so much.

Does anyone have experience with fertility/eating disorders? Should I even be worried? I am too afraid to see a medical doctor; every memory I have with doctors is honestly traumatic and reminds me of two years ago, makes me sad and upset, and I feel like it's ""not severe"" enough for me to go since I would surely have other medical symptoms of anorexia.

Similar thing with ""potential pregnancies"", on one hand I'm worried but on the other hand I feel like it's too late, I will never have kids anyway because of the past/my lack of periods.",1538560069,10/3/2018 4:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9kzp4y/request_i_may_be_anorexic_and_i_had_unprotected/,9

I wasn’t overweight by any means before going to the gym. I’m naturally very slender. I started going to have an outlet for my stress and i wanted to get in ‘shape’. Before the gym, i was just ‘skinny’.

The only problem is that I’m obsessed with the number on the scale. I’m currently sitting a couple of pounds above my old weight.

I obsess over the way I look in the mirror, and I feel an unexplainable *need* to be undeeweight.

It's come to the point where I'm just eating only very specific ""healthy"" foods. It tastes good but I know it isn't a meal.

435,9kk4n2,"Exhausted 9ish months in, not sure how to manage thoughts, approach meals in a healthy way","Hi everyone - I am in recovery for years of highly disordered eating patterns (severe undereating). I finally decided to make the change this year, and it's been a very bumpy road - but one where I increasingly felt better and better and had more internal strength to keep moving forward.

I've reached a point where I'm finally learning how to cook tasty foods, but I just cannot seem to get past my hangup on calories. I've gained some weight to where I am just slightly overweight according to standard measurements, but my partner says I look healthier than when we met. I have on and off struggles with going up a size and a half in clothes. Some days I have a great relationship with my body and other days it's an uphill battle. I've done a lot of internal personal work lately on unrelated emotional struggles that have really freed up the ability to experience more self love. It's actually really nice.

That all said, I also am recovering from post traumatic stress and if I do not eat enough calories and variety, my anxiety is physically dangerous (sharp drops in blood pressure, cannot leave the house), making exercising at a gym not a good option right now. (I love the gym, so I'm a little sad!) The neighborhood I live in is not safe to walk in, although we do have a yard (but with neighbors who are always outside, lol), and I've looked at some of the bodyweight exercises available. Just doesn't feel like ""enough"" exercise, and I've got a herniated disk so I have to tailor workouts around that (which is fine, but still ugh). BUT, every time I know I need to eat, I shy away from higher-calorie foods. My body seems at its best when I go to Whole Foods and do not restrict myself from piling on a plate at the hot bar, full of nutritional variety and delicious flavors. Unfortunately replicating that level of variety at home is unrealistic, as I cook 90% of my meals at home and cannot afford otherwise.

It's also hard because I know which foods are inflammatory for my body and affect me mentally and/or physically; wheat is one, yet delicious sandwiches are also something I enjoy eating, AND can get substantial calories. Hot dogs are in this category too; I come from personal education in holistic nutrition, so eating foods like hot dogs feels ""unhealthy"" for me despite my deep need for substantial food. All I can think about when I eat such foods are how ""badly"" my body reacts to wheat or how ""unhealthy"" hot dogs are, which makes it challenging to just enjoy the meal. Even though I frequently feel more stable afterwards.. but then I get afraid if I enjoy that food and its stabilizing effects too much I'll just keep eating more (bc that's how I gained this weight) and gain even more weight. I feel trapped in this cycle and I believe that the stress related to all of it affects my appetite a lot of the time... which does not help. My stress is far better than it used to be, but it's still definitely not helping.

I've created a two page chart listing all kinds of foods I can cook that day for some variety, and it was a huge help! But without an appetite, I ""don't want"" much of anything. When I do want things, it's an exhausting list, and sometimes I get full or bloated quickly.

I don't know how to find a way to feel free. I really think I should see a nutritionist, but because of the post traumatic stress, I'm working from home right now and the income allows me to live only within my current means. A new online business I'm launching soon should help with this, but I don't know when that will be substantial enough.

I want to give my body what it needs, but I don't know how to manage the thoughts, my emotions, my habits, instill new ones. What's funny is that I managed to do it for my trauma which was even worse than this to work through - I thought after that I'd be able to handle anything lol but this is a hell of a beast.

I’ve been struggling with  an eating disorder (or disordered eating) for over six months now but  I’ve had issues with my body for a long long time. I feel like I’m  getting less and less in control of it.

Calories, numbers and figures are taking over my life. I hardly eat  anything of a day and when I eat over my calorie allowance I tend to  purge. This can happen multiple times a day. I’m losing about half a  stone a week at the moment and it keeps on dropping all the time. Even  with all of this I’m not in control. I ate a normal lunch today (what I  would have eaten before) and I had to take a diazepam beforehand and  even then I felt so anxious and guilty and I couldn’t get rid of it  because I was at work. 

I’m just sick and tired. I’m terrified of being overweight or gaining  weight. I very rarely have a day of eating normally, if ever and if I  do I’ll follow it with more days of fasting or restricting or purging my  meals. I feel like I’m fake and not really suffering from an ED when I  eat something without purging.

443,9jhk2o,Request: Conflicted Over The Multitude Of Recovery Approaches," 

Hi! I've started a  treatment program with a psychiatrist a month ago and I'm really  struggling with the amount of information available about the different  methods.  
 I was diagnosed with bulimia (in a country where only AN, BN and EDNOS  are recognised). My problem was/is binging, food obsessions, calorie  counting (not restricting low at all but always counting), eating shame,  body checking and this year also extreme exercise and heightened  restriction. I never purged or used laxatives.  This year I went from being mildly overweight to a 'normal' weight and  became severely depressed and lost my period among other things.

I reduced the exercise and upped my intake (mostly by binging) before  starting treatment. My psychiatrist put me on a structured eating plan  aiming for 'normalcy' - tl;dr eat what others eat when others eat and do  your best to not binge. She considers my weight a non-issue and wants  me to exercise only socially and not hard.

However I've read and seen tons of material about alternatives such  as Minnie Maud, weight restoration meal plans, intuitive eating, HCLF  veganism, behaviour-oriented training and psychotherapy. Frankly I am  very anxious about how much focus I ought to put on the following  aspects: stopping behaviours, working on emotional aspects and physical  healing. I am concerned that I am not doing enough for any of those and  it will halt my recovery or make it ineffective. On the other hand  reading/thinking about recovery itself can be very triggering for me and  make the problem seem overwhelmingly large. How do I gently bring up  this concern to my psych without sounding like a WebMD expert?",1538088615,9/27/2018 17:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9jhk2o/request_conflicted_over_the_multitude_of_recovery/,4
444,9jhjlk,Request: Had An Argument With My GF About Her ED," 

So, earlier today I had a fight with my girlfriend about her anorexic behavior, which started fully because of me, and I wan't to apologise to her but I really don't now what I should say. I thought this post would better fit here than [r/relationship\_advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice).

Here's some info about the whole situation

So her ED started around two years ago, at first it didn't seem so bad (ignoring the fact that it is a bad thing). I didn't know her at all then, I've only seen her at school few times, then about 1.5 years ago we began talking and we became best friends immediately and that lead to my feelings for her to be a little more than just my best friend. A little while ago she said that she's into me too and since then we've been dating and she's helped me with my bipolar disorder and mild drug/alcohol addiction. But it isn't all dancing of roses ofc.

About a year ago I found about her ED where she'd just eat stuff and purging it all, sometimes even just for ""fun"" or to find out what will happen. Nowadays she'll either binge for a couple of days or will not even eat a bite of ricecake for days. Sometimes she makes a smoothie of all the things she likes to fool Ana with the feeling of drinking instead of eating.

I've tried to help her, but sometimes my BD makes me very angry and today, I crossed the line and literally forced her to eat, because she promised she would eat after 70 hours of not eating. I was tired and I hadn't got any nicotine because I don't wanna smoke when I'm at her place because her parents.

She went to kitchen to get food, and it just waited on her table because she said that 10 minutes and I'll eat. So after about a 15 min later I asked if she was gonna eat it and she said no, and I don't even know why I became so angry about it. So I said that I'll go and tell her parents (which is kinda hard because her mom is asian and doesn't really speak my language) and she immediately started begging me not to, and even said that she will eat the whole thing.

She knew that I'd have to leave soon, so she said that ""Shouldn't you be leaving"" in a way that sounded like she wanted me to leave and it made me angry and sad at the same time so I said ""So it has reached a point where you don't even want me near you while you eat so you could just throw it all up"" and I started to gather my stuff (jacket, phone etc. not like everything). It obviously made her cry and I felt instant regret for what I did and went to hug her.

After that I left and felt so bad for what I did and went to see all kinds of information about EDs and how to deal with such thing and even talked to my mom about it (I never really talk with anyone about my feelings) and I could not find any specific answer how to make it up to her and how to actually apologise to her. I know I've treated her wrong and this is not the first time.

I've wanted to gain weight for as long as i can remember but even after months of consistent calorie counting and eating multiple times a day(which was literal hell considering how much i hate eating) nothing change. I'm still the same skinny girl I've always been. i often wish i had something straight forward like anorexia where there's a clear cause and a clear target to approach.

I've tried everything from cooking for myself for weeks. just straight up ordering home delivered pizza and whatever for weeks. eating as much sweets and snacks as i physically can. drinking just straight up protein calorie whatever shakes but nothing changes. even all the depression medication i pick i specifically request the ones that have those potential weight gain side effects but of course they do nothing.

its hard to find food to even eat in the first place as i have so many allergies and sensory issues regarding such a vast amount of textures. people always suggest me to eat nuts for easy calories and considering I'm deathly allergic to them i cant help to consider it some joke directly orchestrated by god just to be a pain in my ass

most of the time i don't feel hunger. i only know that I'm hungry when I'm feeling dizzy or something. my stomach is I'm constant pain though. like its not bad but enough for me to simultaneously consider I'm hungry all the time permanently. eating doesn't help it so i don't really know what to think

ive seen doctors. only info i get is that i have really high metabolism. that's it

with all these things combined.. i just don't eat. why bother i can manage a whole week with just some bread every now and then. why bother trying to eat normal amounts if it doesn't help me? sometimes i eat a meal every day. sometimes id rather just not think about food and go with water.

i guess my problem is that since I've eaten so little all these years ive permanently broken something and there's no way to fix it no matter what or how much i eat.

i have a psychotherapist who is specialized in eating disorders. but its not helping. I'm not gonna stop it anything cause its helping with my other issues. but I'm 25 and i still way as much as i did as when i was 15 and i really wish that wasn't the case. id be so happy with myself if i somehow managed to change.

what do i do? what should i ask my therapist to help me with? no matter how we plan i just physically cant put that food on my plate and into my mouth and its driving me insane. should i try to talk to doctors again if there's something wrong with my body causing all this?",1539223912,10/10/2018 21:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9n5v83/request_i_just_hate_food_what_do_i_do_whats_wrong/,6

451,9n5r3w,"Request: My Girlfriend (21) Has An ED, Wants Me To Help Her Not Binge. How Do I Talk To Her?","My girlfriend tends to binge and purge. Often times, she just binges and then regrets it later to the point of self-hatred on a dangerous level. We discussed what I can do if I see her starting to binge on sweets. My question is, HOW do you tell someone who is about to binge to stop, metaphorically taking the plate out of their hand, without hurting them?

More details: she had anorexia, and then bulimia. She has anxiety (medicated), bipolar (medicated), and PTSD. She did in-patient treatment that treated mostly anorexia, and started her path to recovery. She's in college, part time working, and stressed and struggling so she decided that in a few months she will return to in-patient/out-patient therapy to help her work through her ED, and her trauma, which seems to be the root of her ED.

Speaking of trauma, she had experiences in which her Dad would take her and her sister out to a Chinese Buffet, then put her down for getting too much Mac n Cheese, and literally take the plate away. As a punishment her sister could get dessert and she had to sit and watch. On the flip side, her Mom would see her binging and do nothing. So she is stuck between wanting to be held accountable and traumatized from having food taken away.

Either way, she has asked me (and soon hopefully others that support her like friends, roommate, family) to sometimes tell her in a loving way to not keep eating that 3rd slice of chocolate cake, or that whole bag of candy corn. My question is: how do I say that in the least hurtful way possible? I feel like asking ""are you sure you REALLY want that?"" would be condescending. I feel like lovingly saying ""hey hername maybe dessert isn't a good idea tonight"" but I'm not sure if that would be effective.

I have the book ""Life Without ED"" and I have like 1+ year experience with her recovering so I kind of get how her mind works and the things ED makes her think, but this is a situation I really do need help. I need a script, I need to know what to say. Any suggestions or similar situations welcome please!

And I wish there was a way to have a system of checks and balances with you folks in regards to me not overusing or misusing this immense responsibility. I am not some super healthy dietitian, like if we want dessert, you bet I'm game! So I WILL NOT be controlling, overbearing, shaping her diet, etc. Just be there to pull her back from her destructive behavior, and not misidentify normal behavior as destructive, which means I may miss and let a few light binges through, but hey it's progress!",1539223013,10/10/2018 20:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9n5r3w/request_my_girlfriend_21_has_an_ed_wants_me_to/,14

453,9mi91w,Request: Slipping back into unhealthy eating habits,"In college I [26|f] I struggled in my last 2 years with unhealthy eating. I went to them gym 4-5 times a week, became a vegetarian, and restricted my calories heavily. I was really obsessive about it, and looking back, I know it wasn't healthy. I lived off of granola bars and whatever light canned soup was on sale. I was never diagnosed with anything or saw anyone, and I'm not sure if I need to, really.

I got better (sort of) when I met my husband. He's a lover of food and a great cook, and when I moved away from the gym I went to, I ended up falling out exercising. The result was that I gained back all the weight that I had lost (not great) but I had a better relationship with food for a bit. Then, I figured I need to reign it back in to a healthy weight.

The past 5-6 months, I can tell I've started slipping back, though. Skipping meals when I can, trying to be sneaky about it, body checking, going to the gym to ""purge"" the calories etc. I've lost weight, but now my husband has brought up some concerns. I'm unfortunately at the place where I can tell that my perspective isn't great, but I'm still a healthy weight (since I was overweight at the start). It feels like I'm still ok, and I'm not motivated at all to change my habit bc it's working and I could still stand to loose some. But I know that I might keep feeling that way (like I could loose more). It's really conflicting. I don't know why I can't just do this in moderation.

I'm not sure if it has helped or not, but I have completely ignored my weight in this. I don't own a scale anymore, so I don't obsess with seeing that number go down, but it also kept me from entering a goal weight. So I don't have a clear stopping point, but even if I had that, I'd probably just change my goal weight constantly. Advice appreciated, support appreciated.

454,9mi8in,"Request: My sister has an ED (Anorexia), and Idk what to do or how to help","Hi all,

This may not be the right place or even the best place to post this so I apologize in advance if it isn’t.

But my youngest sister just started college and she had to be brought back home because of her ED. She would only eat very small amounts, but always had to workout. Now she is so skinny since leaving for college my family and I feel we have no choice but to bring her home since health is the most important thing.

We have been looking into inpatient facilities, so that she can get the help she needs. She has told the doctor that she knows she has a problem and wants to get better, so I am taking that as a positive, but I am so so worried about her. Having to bring her to a inpatient facility is what we feel is best since we do not know/are not equipped to deal with this. We will give her all the love and support she can imagine, but at this moment we are not sure what else to do.

If anyone has any advice for us, please share. We want to make sure that we are doing right by her, and although we would like for her to stay and do an outpatient regimen, the doctor said that it would be unwise. He does not believe since she is so deep into it that she can do it on her own. He said that if we had not caught it in the next couple weeks she could have died in her sleep.

TL;DR- 18 yr old sister has been diagnosed as anorexic, it is so bad that the doctor recommended she go to an inpatient facility. It only has come to our attention that she just wasn't eating healthy, and she lost so much weight so quick.

Any advice, tips, or advice on where is a good place for her to go would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

456,9mi7io,Request: Do I have an eating disorder?,"It's been brought up to me a handful of times, but I chose to ignore it. But now as I sit in bed starving with no motivation to eat, I wonder if it's true.

Basically I know my eating routine is bad, but would you consider it a disorder?

So, if I'm alone and looking after myself for a day, the chances of me eating are slim, due to laziness, not knowing what to cook/buy, not wanting to go to the shops, not being ""in the mood"" to eat whatever I suggest to myself.

I don't have body issues like I'm incredibly slim but not because I want to be that way, if anything id like to be a little less flesh and bone and a bit more chunky. But it doesn't bother me, I rarely think about my body.

Anyway, back to my eating habits. I am someone who loves quick bites, but it won't be fruit or healthy things, it will be chocolate bars or crisp sandwiches or noodles. For me to cook myself a meal that isn't complete shite, I would literally have to message friends for motivation or have someone with me that also wants to cook. I also struggle to go outdoors a lot of the time so this adds to the not wanting/going shopping for food issue.

As I'm typing this, it's 3pm, I haven't got out of bed once. I've eaten nothing, because I don't know what I want/ nor am I bothered. But I'm not purposely avoiding food, I just feel the effort that goes into eating is just too much for me. I know that must sound ridiculous but I just want to see what another person's opinion on this would be.

Some advice would be great, I want to feel good health wise because I'm always tired and grumpy and I know that's due to my diet.

I should also add that I'm vegetarian, which makes it just that little bit harder for me.

Struggling with depression has made me lose my appetite almost entirely and I only eat when I’m to the point that I start feeling light headed or to make my stomach stop growling because it’s annoying. When I do eat it’s usually very little.

Before my depression hit really hard I lost about 11-13lbs which really showed because I was thin to begin with. I haven’t weighed myself recently but I know I’m still losing weight because I can see it in the way that my clothes fit.

My psychiatrist put me on remeron to help gain weight and to stop the nightmares I was having and it worked but I haven’t taken it in a while because it is really expensive and I haven’t been able to afford it. I am on Zoloft too for my depression specifically and I saw that it is often prescribed for people that suffer from eating disorders.

So my question is do you think that I have one based on the information above? My psychiatrists and therapists haven’t come right out and told me that I have one but I’m on medication for it. Plus this weekend my boyfriend mentioned that my eating habits are starting to concern him and he thinks that I might have one and that’s has really freaked me out.

Two years ago I was referred to a clinic, they assessed me and the conclusion was that my eating issues are just down to emotional regulation.

I can’t even eat an apple because I can’t stop imagining a hair somehow inside of it.

I’ve also been having dreams almost every night that I’m eating rotten or disgusting food. Last night I had a dream that I was eating raw ground beef and I just wanted to barf when I woke up. I ended up bolting out of my dude’s house with some excuse about how I had to be somewhere.

I can drink water or coffee as long as I wipe down the cup first but I seriously haven’t been able to take more than a bite of something in days.

I have resumed all my habits of overspending on food (because I buy weird, rare and expensive low-calorie, low-sugar, low-fat, low-whatthefuck items in large quantities), hoarding and stocking food, overthinking about food, overexercising, abusing diet sodas, obsessively planning and filling up my day in order to avoid eating until dinner, etc.etc. Today before dinner I was so weak and asthenic that I took the escalator because regular stairs were too hard to climb, someone taking my blood pressure in that moment would have been in for some funny value.

I can't go back home, I don't want to explain why but I just can't. I also can neither see my old therapist - she's not into therapy sessions over skype - nor look for a new one here, because I can't afford it (and the free ones don't speak my language). I am not able to meet new people because even getting out of my house is scary enough. I feel desperately alone, said and out of control. I can't even talk with my mother, because she wants to see me happy and optimist and I don't want her to suffer for me. I don't know what to do.",1538921452,10/7/2018 9:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9m5ays/request_moving_away_from_home_has_sparked_a_major/,3
463,9m5a9o,Request: Bringing up behaviors with therapist,"For background I've had bulimia for around 7 years and have mostly stopped purging. However, I do slip with purging, usually once a month or less. I've avoided full on binges for the most part but still compulsively overeat (really hard symptom for me to overcome, even in the midst of stopping other behaviors)

Lately, since school started I've been extremely stressed out and for the first time in a long time actually went to a store for the intended purpose of obtaining binge stuff to purge. It felt like I wasn't all there and in the middle of buying stuff, sort of freaked out realizing that I really cannot afford to fall into this endless and hopeless cycle while trying to graduate and get a job. I threw away most of the food, which was upsetting and difficult to do, but it was a small victory I suppose.

However, I have recently failed to stop bp'ing twice since the aforementioned episode last week, and it's scaring me a little bit. I brought this up with my therapist but I feel he kind of only briefly addressed my symptoms, stating ""you must really be stressed out, is there any way to soothe yourself and self-care?"" and quickly changing topics. I'm not saying he did anything wrong, as I'm indeed making some progress in my overall life and perhaps he was just trying to orient me towards progress and shift my mind from avoidant/escapist behavior to moving forward.

Should I continue to express my concerns or just go with the flow? I'm honestly afraid he'll perceive that I'm just making excuses to avoid the current educational/vocational tasks at hand. Then again, just brushing on these concerns might also make it easy for me to get away with behaviors, if that makes sense. I cannot seem trust my own perception of wellbeing because professionals often tell me I'm doing well when I don't honestly think so.

465,9otwla,Request: Feeling self-conscious about not being able to enjoy ‘good’-tasting or well-prepared food,"My (24m) ED (a mix of restriction and exercise punctuated by the occasional binge) has been with me for about a decade now. It introduced me to such delicacies as the baby carrot lunch and the Subway™ 6-inch sub. Foods that, for all intents and purposes, are satisfying enough to me because I’m eating something but foods that, also, don’t do much less for me than prepared food at home or in a restaurant does.

It’s kind of liberating because I don’t want to go to Michelin starred restaurants and spend Michelin starred amounts of money. But it makes me feel bad that I can’t enjoy that food for however good it is and, when I do end up going to a restaurant, feel like a fool for spending money for something that is gonna make me feel bad (finding safe foods, being self conscious over safe foods, etc).

Anyway I’m wondering: do you regain a taste for food in recovery? Is a fear of shit pallet just hiding my fear of allowing myself to be comfortable at a restaurant? Is it the fact that food itself (not anything about that food) makes up a large share of why i enjoy food, so /better/ food isn’t going to do much more? lmk!!",1539739618,10/16/2018 20:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9otwla/request_feeling_selfconscious_about_not_being/,3

467,9otuyw,Request: Terrified to tell my partner about my ED. Really need help on how to talk to him and ask for help,"I’m 27 years old &amp; currently in the best relationship of my life, We have been together for only a few months and I know that seems short to many, but we both have mutual feelings that we will be forever partners. We are extremely close and with each other and only apart maybe 2-3 days/nights a week.

I feel like everything is perfect aside from my eating disorder ( have been bulimic since 18 ). I suffer and am dealing with being bipolar and he is very supportive and considerate of my emotions and actions and sees how hard I try to keep myself level and to make his life as pleasant as he makes mine.

I eat healthy and clean when I’m not binging, and I feel like it’s obvious when I am binging and purging. He’s never said anything or brought up anything about disordered eating or my eating in general other than he thinks I eat healthy and he likes that.

An issue for me is that he works as a chef , cooks very well ( foods that I consider unsafe or am not comfortable to digest yet ), loves to see me enjoy food, and we go out to dinner; and I have an extremely hard time trying to control myself.

I’m ridden with so much shame, disgust, embarrassment and hate for myself because I feel like a huge disappointment and fuck up. I want to be normal so badly for him and everyday I’m trying to make progress secretly, and I do, but then the cycle just continues and spirals downward again.

I’ve been trying to think of how to break it to him because it’s killing me. He’s really the only person in my life and I’m terrified if/ when I talk to him about this every thing will change. Socially and emotionally.

I used to see a psych but currently don’t at the moment do to moving to this city a few months ago prior to meeting him and am looking for a new psych. He knows about my other mental problems but not my eating disorder.

I would really appreciate any suggestions, help and/ or guidance on how to approach my significant other about my eating disorder with hopes of not damaging our relationship. I really don’t want him to feel like I didn’t trust him enough to tell him or something because that’s not what it is. I want him to continue to trust me too.

I’m really terrified at the thought of even bringing up the subject to him but I know I need too. I want to get help and get clean.

For those who feel comfortable could you message me or comment here and discuss how you broke it to your partner? Where, when and what did you say?

I’m sorry this was so long. Really not looking for pity or anything I just think this is my only safe place for this content.

468,9o5ty9,Update: Recovery Finally,"First post was here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8q1y1p/request_recovery_finally/?st=JN8YLBOH&amp;sh=6ca82d9a

(First post TL;DR: my wife has struggled with an ED for more than half her life, and finally went in for treatment. She almost died. Is doing a great job in recovery.)

I wanted to post an update, because I’m so proud of her I want to shout it from the rooftops but we have neighbors. I also want to post something that may encourage anyone who may need intensive treatment but is afraid or reluctant. If anyone in the comments wants more information on our experience, I’ll respond to any requests for PMs in the comments. I strongly encourage anyone who is thinking/on the fence/ reluctant but their family wants them to go to start researching options. ED specialists are crucial and most doctors and therapists aren’t well equipped to help. Don’t let it come as close to killing you as we got.

She finished inpatient back in June. She was very committed to getting home as soon as possible. They had some concerns about her burning out because she did inpatient so fast, but she’s done a great job sticking with it. The way this place works, after inpatient, they step you down incrementally. You start going in during just the days- think day camp- and then over time you go less and less. Next week is her last week of programming and they’ve hooked her up with a therapist and a registered dietitian for her moving forwards, but these are routine appointments, not the program.

She’s made several friends there. Many are doing great after they left, some have relapsed, however, but they all do their best to support each other. I was surprised by the interactions I had with the male patients. I get the impression there’s a little bit of a stigma for men admitting an ED and a bigger stigma in asking for help. Several people from the program have got an unofficial group text “support group”. Yesterday was hard for her, and a short “I need help” text brought an outpouring of support and love. The more people invested, the better the outcome. Overall, I love these people and the recovering ED community. They’re all just so...sincere? Compassionate? Just great people who are very empathetic and supportive.

She’s had struggles- typically when the program steps down to the next level. She feels ready for this one. While some meals are difficult and she needs support getting past them, she’s also beginning to have meals that are just “normal”, she eats and then goes about her business like anyone else would. She’s eating things that she likes, and finding new foods. It’s a fairly common occurrence for her to say “I’ve never eaten this before” or “I’ve been afraid of this” or “I’ve never kept this down before”. Food is becoming something enjoyable without triggering bad thoughts a lot of the time. She’s starting to have experiences where she is happy with how she looks.

This last week we were in south Florida for a vacation and family event. She was somewhat worried that it would be a little triggering because of bikinis, etc, and (apologies to the locals) south Florida has got to be the east coast capital of vanity and superficiality. We made some plans and contingencies. Here’s some of the things that she’s done this trip.

-ate nearly all the exchanges her dietician made for her. Most of the days she missed was by one or two, and was more logistical than restricting.

wore a fairly revealing 2-piece bathing suit.

wanted to go to the clothing optional bar in Key West, and decided to get naked- she was the first person naked that night. (That was just fun, but I was so impressed that she was so comfortable and accepting her body)

saw several people that showed significant signs of an ED. This would have really affected her in the past, but all it triggered here was conversation.

followed her plans and used her tools to get through the rough parts.

Overall the trip was great for her and honestly did a lot of healing to our relationship. We have been pretty busy in real life, and the break from the world gave us the opportunity to really talk and “get to know each other” again. Several lovely nights of just staying up talking.

I feel like I have my wife back. For the last 18 months before treatment, things had unraveled and devolved steadily until she was in pretty rough shape. Emotionally she struggled, and almost couldn’t leave our room. Now she’s getting herself back. She loves herself now. She’s getting high-function brain stuff back (I had no idea previously how profoundly EDs and being underweight affect mental functions). We talk a lot about what she doesn’t remember and building a new life. How she’s starting to be able to be creative again.

Again, I don’t want to make it sound like it’s easy or she’s done. We (rarely) have behaviors, and she’s getting really good at identifying them (some are tricky/sneaky) and identifying triggers. Now that she’s healthy she’s starting to unpack her trauma stuff that triggered this in the first place. However, even though it’s painful, it’s the next step towards a wonderful life.

My life and her life has never been so good.

Be good to yourself, it’s worth it.",1539547299,10/14/2018 15:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9o5ty9/update_recovery_finally/,6

473,9nslsc,Request: Are These Indicators Of An ED? Should I Tell My Therapist?,"So something happened between my mom and me and now I'm starting to wonder if I might have some questionable eating habits.

I told my mom I was dieting (I'm kind of overweight anyways so it's a good thing) and I'm using my prescribed adderall to help stop me from feeling overly hungry. I didn't know that's apparently a bad thing. She freaked out and I had to backtrack and say it was some joke that was a little too messed up to say.

I've been looking back at my eating habits because I was taken aback that using adderall for dieting is considered unhealthy. So I have a few other dietary habits that I've noticed I've have/had: 

1) whenever I heavily restrict calories for a day or more I have a sense of pride and happiness for myself. 

2) I have a sense of control once restricting. I've been body conscious since I was 8 years old (earliest memory of me feeling some form of emotional negativity due to my body shape). 

3) I will chew up food and spit it out 

4) I work at a pizza place and sometimes I'll stare at leftover food that's good to eat and then throw it away, even if hungry. 

5) there have been times I've purposely over exercised. 

6) I've tried purging a few years ago, but I failed. 

7) my life crashes around me if I find that I gained some form of weight. 

8) I have some clothes that I currently don't fit in as a reminder to lose weight. 

9) I used to binge infrequently.

I just don't really know because I'm not underweight or even in the ""healthy"" range of BMI, I'm actually hovering on the lower end of the overweight spectrum on the BMI scale.

And I don't really restrict all the time. I'll eat a decent share of food with friends. But that's kind of only when I eat a decent plate of food, as of recently. I'm not always restricting without friends. It'll come and pass - which is probably why I'm still fat. Earlier in the post I said I would binge every so often. That was when I was severely depressed and I'm as depressed anymore.

I just don't really know if my eating habits are actually pointing to an eating disorder or not.",1539423695,10/13/2018 4:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9nslsc/request_are_these_indicators_of_an_ed_should_i/,5

I've had some periods of recovery, but despite going to treatment 3 times, not much long-term success. Since this spring, I've fallen back and relapsed pretty badly. I've been having a hard time with restricting, bingeing and purging, movement/exercise obsessions, and laxative abuse. My therapist and dietitian are concerned and have been recommending treatment again for a while, but I've been putting it off.

I know I need help, and yet, the idea of going through this process again is just exhausting. It feels never-ending, and like I'm just treading water and getting nowhere. Additionally, going back to treatment would mean dropping my classes and taking a leave of absence from school. I would feel so guilty doing this--I feel lazy and like I'd be avoiding my problems and taking the easy way out or just giving up.

481,9qy4v3,"Request: 3 years of anorexia/3years of binge eating, I've recovered but I feel like I am relapsing","So I am currently experiencing some relapsing problems with binge eating, which I had sort of resolved in the last two years, and I am really worried that I am getting back to it and that it may spiral into something unhealthy. I was really feeling more confident about myself in the past year, but the situation I am in now doesnt really let me control as much as I'd like to so I am here now..... For a bit of my backstory, So I developed an eating disorder around 6 six years ago and it really hit me hard for the first three years, I was around 15 years old then and it really made my self esteem crash tremendously. While in University (17-18 years old), I struggled alot in my first year trying to force myself into socializing, and going out and drinking. It got a little better then but I developed binge eating, and that has really been my issue ever since. I really had problems with it in my second year of university, where I would spend a whole day just eating lots and lots of food and feeling sick and fatigued for the whole day.. for this reason, I had to see a psychologist for 7 months because I was getting depressive episodes, and my self steem was hitting rock bottom. Since 2016, I've recovered quite well and alot of it has been owed to my boyfriend because I got accustomed to eating with someone else, being with someone that is a whole lot more relaxed with looks and eating habits, and who doesn't look as food as groups but rather as food on its own, which has balanced me alot. And last year, it was very good because I was in an environment of people in university, where everyone went to the gym, everyone ate healthy and I wasn't particularly happy socially, so it wasn't hard to exclude myself from social events, allowing me to control my eating habits and schedules alot. I was not excessive nor did I count calories, but I tried to eat the exact same way and tried to abstain from ""bad foods"" during the week, yet I always managed to binge at least a little within the week. On a weekly basis, I would binge one time, on foods i'd usually wouldn't have but it wasn't as bad nor desperate as the binges I had had before, i would feel really full but not sick.

Now I am really struggling because I started my masters and it has been extremely stressful. Also, i live in a big city, I commute on average 2 hours a day and I have four hours of class in the morning and the rest of my day is spent working/studying. I tend to leave my house at 8am and come back at 8 or 9pm, and I really feel knocked out. My biggest problem lately has been how tired I get, and how I just want to be able to come back home and just relax... the problem is that the gym has always been very stabilizing for me (i love doing weights), so it helps me eat normally and it keeps me basically sane and boosts my confidence. Now that I get tired and I dont have enough time, i dont do 6 sessions a week but I do four, I also cannot eat as optimally as i did before because protein products are not as available in the country, and they're stupidly expensive. I have found alternatives but it has taken time to adapt to the new eating habits... So I am both struggling with being tired, sort of stressed and disappointed for not being at my optimal, and I keep feeling like I am relapsing into my binging disorder. I tend to have one day in the week where I allow myself to eat what I want, not for the whole day, but sometimes I start eating something and it continues and continues. I let myself do it at least once because it gives me satisfaction just being able to be chilled out and eating while watching a show, specially because I really dont get that much the whole week, and I also dont get much time on my own. I know this may be an unhealthy attachment between emotions and food, but it helps me feel relaxed. However, I keep feeling shit because I feel like these problems with binging, the self esteem issues and the stress from not being in full control are really really catching up to me and can also affect my academics, because I am not only stressed with workload but with not feeling great with myself. Because of my schedule, i cant skip classes nor can I be flexible with my gym times, and also, I have a quite strong social life (which im so happy about) but it also doesnt allow me to be optimal, because we drink, we go out for meals and obviously, it doesnt allow me to control all my meals nor my calorie intakes, considering I binge once in the week.

Also, I eat really filling meals and dont avoid food groups because I know it triggers binging, which really has helped. But I just currently struggle and have struggled with sweet products (cereal, honey, bars, dark chocolate, peanut butter- Not cookies or actual dessert like stuff). I prefer to buy them so I don't label them as bad foods but the binging makes me feel so bad that I feel like throwing it all away..however I really do try and have tried to build a healthier relationship, but I dont know if what I am doing is super unhealthy, and if there is something essentially wrong with me where I am not putting enough effort to fight this eating disorder.

I am really worried and I'd really appreciate some help from those who have recovered because I don't know if these relapses are normal, or if it's just me being easy on myself and allowing myself to be basically a fatty where I eat whatever I want just because I am tired.",1540373931,10/24/2018 4:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9qy4v3/request_3_years_of_anorexia3years_of_binge_eating/,7
482,9qpeje,Request: How Do I Support My S.O With Her ED?,"The whole thing has been an eye-opening experience to me and I had no idea that people struggle this much with stuff I find so everyday and don't even think about.

I've already figured out the things not to say or to bring up, and how to listen but not try and give sagely advice. What I'm unsure about is what to do during her episodes.

Sometimes the behaviour is so obviously destructive I don't know whether to intervene or not. An example might be her weighing herself, and then taking some laxatives and then weighing herself again several times during the day. Another example is when she gets stuck in an endless loop of stalking other girls' instagram for hours on end, which I know only ends in a lot of self-loathing the more she does it.

Is there anything I can do to snap her out of it at these times, or should I just leave it? I don't know where being supportive ends and being enabling begins. Sometimes I just want to tell her to put her phone down, especially when she goes into social media spirals.

I'm sorry if I come across as insensitive, I'm just sort of stumbling through this without much of an idea and trying to do the right thing.",1540304400,10/23/2018 9:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9qpeje/request_how_do_i_support_my_so_with_her_ed/,4

I've noticed that the food from our dining halls makes me nauseous and is near impossible for me to stomach. While it stays down, I just don't find myself wanting to eat it without feeling ill. Everything is greasy and even our salads are slimy enough to deter me from wanting anything. I don't have the money to keep eating out (dining hall food is included in my boarding tuition), but fast food is the only thing I find myself actually being able to stomach. This means that I will honestly go a week eating one full meal a day at the dining halls (a piece of pizza or soup) and another meal of just a few fries. Possibly one night a week I'll eat out somewhere. I would prepare my own meals if my dorm had a kitchen, but we only have a small microwave. I've lost a lot of weight accidentally and my family and friends are starting to notice. My body feels incredibly weak and hungry 24/7, but it just won't handle the food here.

Anyway I let my boyfriend know about my ED about 3 years into our relationship. He suspected but was still suprised. So now this time around I have gained 15 pounds since my last bad cycle and have a healthier mindset about food plus took a long time off the gym. Now I am unhappy with this bit of weight and want to eat healthier and start running again. Anytime I mention this, my boyfriend will go off interrupting me: “NO you can’t workout you need to eat STOP lying to yourself you’re being unhealthy!!!” Even when I know I’m not and feel like I could control it. This makes me upset because he is my only support system and I feel like I am never alloed to want to eat healthy or workout again without him trying to stop me... call it best interest or whatever it makes me feel really alone and unable to speak openly.

What started as losing weight to improve her morale post breakup has spiralled into her losing 60lbs in about 8 months. She looks very frail, worn, with her ribs showing clearly. All her muscle in her chest is wasted away. She looks very unwell.

While she’s never used the word “anorexia”, she’s commented multiple times about her severe body dysmorphia.

She’s very defensive, the few times I’ve commented on her weight loss (after she brought it up to me first) I’ve been met with her shutting the conversation down by saying she’s tired of hearing criticism about it. I think her mother is on her case a lot about it. Even last night she texted me saying she lost another 3 pounds. I knew that if I commented on it, it would result in her not talking to me for a couple weeks.

She’s not the attention seeking type, (“oh I’m so ugly and fat...” in an attempt to have you butter her up). She keeps mentioning the weight loss to me, and it feels like she’s asking for help.

But I don’t know what kind of help she’s looking for. I’m not allowed to talk about it, I’ve offered to pay for psychological help, I’ve done everything I can. It’s like she pushes me into a minefield where one wrong step results in her being angry and me wondering if I just pushed her into being suicidal.

I also live about an hour away from her due to work, which complicates things.

Does anyone have an idea for a way to provide meaningful, constructive help to my friend, in a way that won’t put her back up and closed to me?

487,9q7tbx,Request: Boost/Ensure Clear: How Many Daily Is OK?,"Hello! I am a self-recovering male adult(using therapy and group support), and I was searching online for an answer to one of my nutrition questions. I happened upon this blog post ""Anorexia Recovery as an Adult: Letting go of nutritional science,"" and it really gave me faith. I have EDNOS with OCD. I still eat plenty, but not enough to support my lifestyle and goes right along with my history of OCD/Anxiety. Anyhow, in summary, I have no issues eating “unsafe” or “scary” foods (even with celiac, lol!), and I don't fear sugar. However, I want to supplement my recovery diet with Ensure Clear supplement juice or Boost Breeze juice. They have calories and nutrients that I require, but the sugar content is very high.

I’ve been having dental work done recently, and really trying to reduce added sugar intake. I had a habit of chewing on hard Lifesaver mint candies for the last few hears, while restricting, and that caused the issues. My question is, in addition to having “junk” foods in my almost daily or weekly diet (in reasonable amounts), would having 3-4-5 of these supplement drinks a day really do me any harm? I want it not to be a bad thing, obviously, as it would be an easy way to get in the added calories and vitamins I need. I found this article from an inpatient facility (https://www.eatingdisordertherapyla.com/the-use-of-supplemental-shakes-in-eating-disorder-recovery/), which mentions using at least 3-5 a day, depending on patient needs.

Also, I notice that everytime I have a significant source of protein for a meal (fish, energy bar, etc.) I get this huge upswing in energy, and that makes me anxious/feel like I have to ""move"" or be active. I guess you could call it anxiety? I need some help in handling this, as well. Any tips you could give me would be a great help!

491,9peciw,Request: I think I’m developing an eating disorder and no one will listen to me,"I went through a horrible break up about 3 weeks ago. I believe the true reason my ex left me was because I wasn’t losing weight fast enough. He constantly made comments about my body, specifically my stomach, which I have always been insecure about. There was also one time he compared me to his ex who was fit (“Rachel used to work as much as you do and SHE found time to take care of herself.”). I was a bit overweight for sure, but I used to try to prove to him I was trying by sending him pictures of salads I ate at work. He claimed when he left me was to work on himself but after everything he put me through I can’t shake the feeling it was me.

Since he moved out while I was at work 3 weeks ago I have lost a significant amount of weight. I went from the high end of overweight on the BMI calculator to now bordering on “healthy” BMI. (I know BMI is bullshit) I am just not hungry. I’m terrified to eat. Every time I try, the things he said about my body just play on loop over and over. I’ve tried to tell people close to me this and the general consensus is “oh that’s normal when you go through a breakup. You lose weight. Don’t worry your appetite will come back.” But I don’t think so. I literally cannot. No matter how hard I try. I cry every time I try to. I even told my therapist this and all she really mentioned was that she can recommend a nutritionist for me. She didn’t even seem too concerned that I lost such a significant amount of weight in such a short span.

I think maybe people don’t believe me? I can’t even really see it too much except my pants are getting bigger on me, but I’ve maybe only lost a bit on my waist. Every time I look at my stomach I want to rip it off. I hate myself. I hate my body. I don’t want to go down this road but I can’t control my thoughts. And no one I talk to about it will listen to me.

Then binges kicked in. At first I just let them happen and every time told myself it was the last time and I would have restricted even harder the following day.

Then, last week, something completely new happened: I vomited. It's not the vomit itself to be new. I have vomited in the past after massive binges, but it was more like me facilitating something that was already about to happen. I was just vomiting because I was so full I felt sick and dizzy and thought that vomiting would have made me feel less sick.

Last week, instead, it was the first time I vomited with the conscious intent to get rid of the calories, as in, to purge. It went like this. I allowed myself to have breakfast after ages, buying a sweet at one of the best stores in town. I ate it, and it felt like something was awoken inside me. The nice breakfast with a sweet suddenly turned into a crazy binge-fest of every sweet available in any store, until nothing else could fit into my stomach. I was utterly desperate and I ran to the bathroom in a panicked, frenzy way. While I was doing it I kept on telling myself ""this is so wrong and disgusting. It's the first and last time it happens."". I was so scared I was shaking, and afterwards I immediately told my mom and two of my closest friends of what had just happened. They were obviously very concerned and told that it's extremely dangerous and I should avoid going down that road. I mean, I already know it, it's not that helpful an advice, but I appreciated it anyways.

Then it happened again. And today it happened for a third time. The dynamic was still similar, I allowed myself to have a normal breakfast/lunch that quickly turned into a binge and a subsequent purge. I am so scared of how quickly it is becoming a habit. I know that three times don't do any damage, it's like having a stomach bug, but I am painfully aware of the long-term risks and that's why I want it to be over as soon as possible.

I am completely shocked by this. I mean completely shocked. Right before coming here I saw my dietitian for a last visit and he asked me if I had ever vomited. I immediately replied ""no, I will never do that!"", and I absolutely 100% meant it. I was convinced that it was just something I would have never done. No matter how hard I was restricting, no matter how unhealthy my eating habits were, vomiting was just something I thought I would have never allowed myself to ever consider as an option. I was grossed out by the mere thought of it. Yet here I am, and right now I am even struggling not to go the bathroom and vomit even more (I know I could). Even though I am scared and rationally don't want to do it, my ED sees it as an emergency measure to get rid of unwanted calories and maintain my sub-optimal weight.

I know I need urgent help. Problem is, my therapist is hundreds of kms away and I can't find another one here because the free ones don't speak my language. I don't know what to do.

505,9rx9ah,Request: a Dilemma - Helping A Friend With A Suspected ED,"its a real difficult situation, having a friend say they're struggling with a suspected ED. i know she needs help now while the signs are still early, and i've told her that i'm here to offer any sort of support i can to get her back on track. but i know how EDs work. i have one. sufferers rarely want to get better, especially before they start seeking real psychological help. i know this could very well be a trap for both of us.

for her, she gets an audience to spectate her disordered behaviour, and validate it as unhealthy and destructive, something most ED sufferers thrive off. and it will no doubt only increase in severity as time goes on, as she strives to prove how real and severe her disorder is. EDs are competitive in nature. i can suggest as many psychs and coping mechanisms as i want (and as i have tried), but she will turn a deaf ear. i know EDs well enough to know that what they thrive off is attention and validation, not help.

for me, i'm trapped as the spectator. unable to look away from the behaviour that i've spent months and months getting over myself, but also voiceless and unable to help. you cant help those who don't want to be helped. i can so easily see my own disordered behaviours resurfacing, the competitive anorexic side of me coming out again, desperate to prove that i really am anorexic, that im not some fake, that my struggles are just as real as hers.

it would end up being a toxic, possibly even fatal relationship for us both. but how do i just abandon a friend when she needs help? its an impossible debate.

I’m having trouble eating again and I have no energy. So that results in me eating food that I don’t “burn” (I used to over-exercise)

It’s just hard to deal with this right now, and I keep getting triggered because my school is doing a mental health week where A.N. keeps getting mentioned and then people automatically ask me “That’s why you weren’t really here last year, right?” Yeah. That is.

I’m tired of this recovery shit. It’s exhausting and I can’t handle having no energy and having to eat “large” amounts of food.

Can anyone offer advice on eating portions and getting my energy levels back up?

507,9rx7xo,Request: looking for advice on body dysmorphia,"So, I thought I'd put this out there somewhere. I don't really have anyone to talk to about it.

When I was younger, I used to model. I modeled up until I was 20 or so. While modeling, I was extremely skinny. Since quitting, I've fluctuated heavily in weight. All in a ""normal"" BMI range, but ranging the full spectrum of that classification, basically. I have a number in mind that is my ""best"" weight and current goal. The ""best"" weight is in the middle of the spectrum, and not considered to be close to underweight.

Whenever I lose weight, I think I look fatter than before I lost the weight. I think it's a psychological thing, but I'm not sure. Whenever I talk to people about my weight they just scoff and say,

""but you're SKINNY! You don't need to lose weight! Just stop and you wont have to worry about it!""

It doesn't really help me with my problem. I want to feel good during my weight loss. One of the reasons I fluctuate so badly, is that I feel worse and worse about myself during the weight loss (because I feel like I look fatter), that I just give up and gain it back. I want to be able to look in the mirror, see my progress, and feel good. Right now, I look in the mirror and feel like it's pointless. Once I REACH my goal weight, I stick to it for a while, and I become normalized to what I look like in the mirror and feel good, but never feel like i look THAT different, ya know? I picked my best weight by what I feel most comfortable at, when I feel like my stomach looks okay, and when my thighs don't rub as much...but I couldn't tell you that I feel ""skinny"".

Is this body dysmorphia? Is there anything I can do? I've seen psychiatrists and therapists for long time due to bi-polar disorder, and they haven't really given my any advice on the matter. It's basically a lot of ""you need to learn to accept yourself for who you are!""

509,9r8q24,Request: Invalidating Psychiatrist ...,"I went to my psychiatrist to talk about something not-ED related and gave her a quick update on the new medication she's had me on for about six weeks now. The medication has crucially improved my executive functioning, quality of life, and overall mood/self-confidence, but a negative side effect is that it's an appetite suppressant. Having little to no appetite has been incredibly reminiscent of times when I struggled with an eating disorder in the past, and a recent life change has overlapped with this new medication, in which I've been making my own meals for the first time in two and a half years (incl eating smaller portions and ""healthier""-prepared foods, as my SO cooked very differently than I feel most comfy eating -- but NOT restricting/having any ""rules"" about foods, just meal prepping because I don't want to cook in the evenings, not eating out because I don't want to spend the $$, and using less oil and salt because I just don't feel the need to add them). I've also been dancing 6 days a week after work as it elevates my mood and energy for the rest of the evening and I love love love it. BUT, when I noticed after the first few weeks of my SO being gone that I had lost weight, I started weighing myself again, realized that I was at the lowest I'd been in years but still a ""normal/healthy"" weight, and felt a VERY intense tug to re-engage in ED symptoms and a flood of ED thoughts over the next few days.

I told my psychiatrist this at the next appointment, that I was worried about relapsing and the ""desire"" to use those old behaviors. She kept saying, ""I don't see the problem. There's no problem. If you're at a ""healthy"" weight, how is there a problem? Eating healthier is good and exercising is good so there's no problem"". I was honestly shocked. I had never felt invalidated by her before, and kept trying to explain that I was worried and wanted to be proactive and aware of how I was feeling. I thought I was being really open, responsible, and healthy (!!) by being honest about my fears and being aware that I was having these tugs towards relapse. I told her I could never go back to that place, where I was so deep in the ED, and she just said, ""Well there's no problem and eating healthy and exercising won't make you do those other things again."" I honestly felt so bad the rest of the appointment and am not sure that I can see her again without thinking about how invalidating those comments were.

Is there any way she's right??? Should I not be aware of a super challenging life change in which I feel like I have no control, happening at the same time as inadvertent weight loss?? I'm confused and honestly feel hurt that I wasn't heard, understood, or validated in my concerns.

((Some background: I have generally considered myself recovered from anorexia (with binge-purge) for the last few years, but I've recently gone through a life change in which my SO decided to move out of state for a better job and I feel trapped in a city without any friends or family. I had to take on a second job just to make ends meet, in addition to my other job and grad school. The transition from sharing day-to-day life with a partner to living all alone (literally without any friends to lean on), taking care of me and my pets by myself, and managing an incredibly hectic work/school life on top of it all has left me feeling like I had no choice in how anything has played out and completely out of control. This is the EXACT kind of situation I'd imagine an ED being likely to resurface, especially when coupled with weight loss, and I wanted so badly for her to understand that I saw the danger in that.))

TLDR; Mostly recovered from an ED. Recent life changes. Noticed weight loss. Told my psychiatrist that I'm worried about ED relapse, and she said there's ""no problem if I'm at a healthy weight"". Felt very invalidated. Looking for support.",1540459917,10/25/2018 4:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9r8q24/request_invalidating_psychiatrist/,3
510,9uk51h,Request: Relationship question,"I met a girl just as she was starting to recover from a severe ED. We fell for each other, started dating and everything seemed to be going great. She was tackling fear foods, and we were planning on adventures to tackle together to help her recover and become healthier. Then out of the blue she pulled a 180 and said she didn't feel a spark anymore which goes against everything she said a day before and every day before that. She said she still wanted to be friends, but when I have reached out she is cold and formal which wasn't like her at all. She then texted me the next day out of the blue saying she was thinking of me and glad we are still close. She then turned formal and arms length away again.

I just don't know what happened. I know she is fighting for her life every minute of every day. I have theories, but I just wish she was honest. I was thinking about suggesting a pause to let her focus on herself, but the ""no spark"" cut like a knife. I think it is a combo of her family and therapist rightfully saying she shouldn't be dating right now and to end things with me so she doesn't peg her recovery to me and her incredibly low self worth. She said things like ""You deserve better than me"" when ending things. I do believe in my heart of hearts that we should not have been dating at that time and should let her focus on her recovery with picking things up when she isn't fighting every single day. But the lack of honesty is tearing me up.

I also want to be there to support her, but know that it could make things harder for her. I am just trying to wrap my head around what happened, if all that happened before was a lie and how I can help her.

TL:DR: Was dating a girl fighting through recovery from life threatening ED. She ended things abruptly, and I am trying to figure out what actually happened and how I can help.",1541469962,11/5/2018 20:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9uk51h/request_relationship_question/,1
511,9uk3ag,Request: Difficult Situation,"A few weeks ago I moved in with an acquaintance (we have facebook friends in common but hadn't met until we vetted each other as housemates). She has been very open about wanting to develop a friendship and we get along well but I don't have a lot of emotional energy for close friendships for reasons mentioned later in the post.

In the first few days she opened up to me about being recovered from eating disorders without going into a lot of detail. She said she brought it up out of concern that I was ""obsessed with food"" because she felt that might be triggering for her and said she thought it might be the case because to her I look tiny and ""must be underweight"".

I have at times been on the low end of healthy weight due to stress, addiction and depression related eating issues, basically just lack of appetite and prioritising paying for drugs over food but have never given any consideration to my eating either way or struggled with body image issues or even been underweight.

I'm currently recovered from addiction and depression and spend a lot of energy maintaining my mental health and am at a very comfortable and healthy weight. I am a tall and sturdily built person and she is very petite but by my judgement a healthy weight. We were swapping some clothes and she was really surprised when I didn't even try on some of hers which I could tell by looking would be several sizes too small and she acknowledged that she still struggles with body dysmorphia.

I am giving all this background for context to the current situation. I have suspected for the last few days that she has been purging and there has been evidence of her binging but I have been torn about bringing it up because it doesn't feel like my business and I don't feel I am in a place where I can be a main source of support for her (although I consider myself an empathetic and non judgmental person). Tonight I found clear evidence that she has been purging because she didn't rinse out the bathroom sink well enough and as cold as it sounds I feel I need to mention it to her because I feel its unhygienic to vomit in the bathroom sink and I am also concerned for the plumbing. I do care about her and her wellbeing as well which is why I am here asking advice about how I can best approach her in a way that is helpful without making myself the main source of support for her as I feel that would be unhealthy for both of us.",1541469598,11/5/2018 19:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9uk3ag/request_difficult_situation/,2

514,9ujzm2,Request: Should I Seek Professional Help?,"I never thought I'd be posting here, but I believe I can't make the judgement myself anymore. Today my boyfriend asked me to seek professional help concerning my eating habits which I thought were pretty normal, so I'm posting to get more views on it.

It all started about 8 months ago when my bmi was still normal but definitely on the upper part of the bar, didn't do any sports and sat most of the day. My colleague has made an innocent funny comment about my body that I wasn't to take personally. Hint: I did. I immediately started a diet, very restrictive one, I only allowed myself one meal per day but it was pretty big one, I didn't count calories. In 2 months I lost some weight and stayed that way for a couple of months.

But then I started the period where I binge ate for a day then starved myself off for another day, it was quite bad period where I was going from extreme to another extreme and result was that my weight still stayed the same. Then I started wanting to lose more weight and be more healthy and my target is basically bottom weight of what bmi still calls normal, I'm not willing to go under this weight under no circumstances.

So I accustomed my eating habits, removed junk food, started eating veggies, started exercising and running, became crazy about nutrition, etc. Although my calorie intake is very very low to lose weight fast, quite a bit under what's recommended if I had no physical activity. I had this diet for a month and half now but all notice is that I have to control myself a lot, I'm irritable, I argue with people much more but if I overdo eating even by a few kcal I feel like I fucked up.

515,9ujz1p,Request: How Can I Help/Support Someone Who Might Have An ED?,"Someone very close to me has recently started to avoid eating food. They say they feel hungry a lot of the time, and they're getting used to it, or even prefer feeling hungry. 

When they don't eat, they have described it as a punishment - they feel like they need to punish themselves for whatever reason, usually something specific, and they strongly believe that they deserve to be punished. They have low self esteem that's been developing for a while and have been speaking negatively about themselves a lot in conversations. They say they tend to only be able to eat when they've been drinking alcohol, but I think they still need to force themselves to do so. 

In their life, they have recently gone through a significant upheaval, which they projected to be a positive thing prior to the change. (It is generally considered to be a positive thing, but can be quite stressful.) Before the upheaval their life was the same for a very long time, and they are in their late teens - I have reasons to believe they have been emotionally abused - including being signed up for a weight loss program based around a points system, which was the first time I noticed that their relationship with food was changing, although they had in the past not been interested in strong flavours and snacked a lot, so perhaps had a slightly unusual relationship with food in the first place, although not unhealthy. They previously didn't cook for themselves, and where they are living now, food is provided. 

I know they are still financially dependent on the person who was abusive, and I'm not involved with the person who was abusive and don't want to be, so I can't intervene there without causing a very complicated situation. They have previously (in the last year or two) also experienced OCD-like symptoms (obsessive thinking, having to perform an action a certain way to prevent something bad from happening, and continuously noticing new actions that need to be performed.) 

After talking about the fact that they've stopped eating, I did some reading on EDs. I gently suggested seeing a professional, and have expressed my desire to support them already, for which they thanked me. They said they would get in touch with some sort of professional the next day, but when I followed up a few days later, they said they never had any intention of following through with seeing a professional. This is unlike them, as they are notably honest and genuine, and in the past have been able to talk to me about anything and everything. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point. I live far away and have also recently gone through a big upheaval, and I can't realistically go and stay with them without putting my life on hold, no matter how much I want to. I feel very out of control of the situation, and as I said, I care about this person a lot. The fact that EDs (if that is what it is) can be deadly has increased my anxiety levels, so I've been trying to distract myself (while maintaining an open line of communication with them) until I know what I can do. I know it's not as simple as just telling them to eat. I considered sending them a bag of nutritional food powder that can be turned into smoothies and provides all that's needed for nutritional needs, but this feels insensitive and maybe intrusive or condescending, and might not help. I can't be with them to make sure they eat something, despite reading that that can sometimes be effective (eating a small amount at a time and slowly increasing the amount over time.) 

The best bet seems to be seeing a professional, but I don't know what I can do to encourage this after what happened last time. So... what can I do?",1541468697,11/5/2018 19:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9ujz1p/request_how_can_i_helpsupport_someone_who_might/,0

520,9wyyz3,Request: Losing Weight For Career With History Of Anorexia,"Hi, I have a history of anorexia. Had impatient treatment over ten years ago and some intensive outpatient a few years later. Neither really helped, but I made some major life changes that lead to recovery. I generally eat what I want but have trouble with restricting consciously or subconsciously during very stressful periods. I've maintained a low healthy weight with very little fluctuation for about five years now.

And we come to now... I work in a field where size is extremely important and specific. Like people not getting hired because they are an inch too tall or too short and a couple pounds outside the parts' specific ideal weight. Some of that size specifically is safety related, and some is just based on ""the look."" But the companies truly have these specific numbers based demands, and not meeting them can kill a career.

So here I am, someone in lifelong recovery, already at a very muscular low weight, but slightly too large, just barely outside the company's ideals for specific jobs that I'm otherwise perfect for. My boyfriend is telling me it's a bad idea, that there are other parts and companies out there that are a bit less size specific. But even though I know he's trying to keep me safe from myself, I can't help but think his advice is motivated by the fact that he prefers women who are a bit softer than I am. I know that's not true... but it makes me mistrust his advice on this.

So I decided that I'm going to track what I eat for a few days before choosing to actually change anything. In the past I've had trouble with accidentally restricting when trying to track what I eat. I think there really has been enough time since the last time it got out of control. But I can't be sure and it's a worry. I truly believe that I can safely lose this small amount of weight, but it's impossible to be certain.

Am I being a fucking idiot about to make a huge mistake? Does anyone else who has been in recovery but needed to lose a very small amount of weight have any advice to help me stay safe and not restrict too much?

Tldr: Been in recovery for 10 years, need to lose a small amount of weight for my career, worried about staying safe while attempting this.",1542191661,11/14/2018 4:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9wyyz3/request_losing_weight_for_career_with_history_of/,5

how can one deal with laxative dependency? is there even a possibility of going off laxatives? at this point i'm pretty much hopeless. asking for a friend.

But lately it's changed to just not eating at all. She started all this because she thinks she's fat and ugly and wanted to change it but it's going way too far.

But even when that happens she'll only eat some crackers or a few small pieces of fruit to trick her body into shutting up. Sometimes she says she doesn't eat because her stomach hurts or food would make her nauseous. I've tried to tell her that maybe not eating regularly might be doing that but she won't accept it! Just today when we were at a theme park in the heat ALL DAY all she ate was a small salad and a few grapes and pieces of pineapple. She refuses to eat anything else. I don't know what to do!

532,9vzuba,Request: Do I have an eating disorder?,"Friends, family and professionals keep telling me that I have an eating disorder but I have no idea what I actually have. The backstory is I used to be really fat, at 16 I was 20 stone so I decided I needed to lose the weight. It was going really well and I was dropping weight each week for 2 years, which is when my mum began saying I was getting too thin. I couldn't understand why because no matter what the scales said I couldn't unsee that 20 stone, so I kept pushing to lose it.

I lapsed back into eating poorly for 2 years and gained some of that back, which made me so unbelievably unhappy. At that point people were telling me I was perfect, but I felt the opposite. I started skipping meals and tried to make myself throw up (It seems I don't have a gag reflex as no matter how desperately hard I try I just cannot trigger that response) and I'm continuing that to this day.

I feel disgusted in myself, I can't bare to ever take my shirt off, even in private, or look in a mirror without wanting to take a knife to myself and cut the fat away. I keep lapsing back into eating more than I want to because I'm so unhappy with my weight which is why I've started skipping as many meals as possible. All I want is to be thin, thin and happy.

For context: I struggled with disordered eating and body dysmorphia for years. I’ve been in recovery for maybe a decade but have had some issues flare back up the past few months. The scale is getting lower but I’m still in a healthy weight range. I’m not tracking. If I start, I know I won’t be able to control this thing.

I so badly want to make changes to my body and I know the science of how to get there. But my brain is stopping me from doing the things I need to accomplish it.

536,9vjhab,Request: How To Talk My Sister Out Of Extended “Water Fast?”,"Hello all. I apologize if this is not the right spot. But I(18F) am racking my brain trying to figure out what to do or say. My sister(21F), is relatively overweight. She has struggled with disordered eating since she was a teen. She always tries to go on health kicks, talks about meal prepping, getting “healthy”, etc., because she is unhappy with her body. And never follows through with any of it. A few minutes ago, she tells me she is planning on doing a water fast. I immediately assumed 2-3 days, which I didn’t approve of regardless, but it wasn’t terrible. Then she tells me she wants to do a 3 WEEK FAST.

She eats a fair amount, a lot of fast food and unhealthy food. I wouldn’t say that she overeats greatly, but she and her husband are both generally unhealthy people. They actually both struggle with disordered eating and body image issues, her husband having had issues with bulimia and starvation to make height and weight requirements for the army.

Anyway. I’m trying to figure out how to convince my sister not to do this. This, I believe, will trigger her back into an unhealthy mindset and relationship with food. When she brought it up I immediately told her the “detox” stuff was a load of bull. You have kidneys and a liver to “detox” your body. She insists that’s the only reason she wants to do it and that we’ll go healthy grocery shopping after she is done with it.

My main concern lies in that these are drastic, sudden changes to eating and lifestyle habits with no easing in; making them more likely to fail, for lack of better words, and revert back to how they ate before the whole ordeal. They’re going to make her feel worse physically and mentally. On top of no long-lasting results by any means. I’m 100% anti fasting as a “diet.” I don’t know if I should just write her a novel via text message since she’s gone to bed (and knows that I’m upset with her about this and it triggers ME) on why it is a terrible idea, or a little handwritten thing. I’m not trying to be condescending or anything but it really upsets me because I’ve been struggling with my eating lately too. And the way she acknowledged it made it seem..... smug? she knew what the implication was and that I knew why she wanted to do it. I’m sorry this became jumbled, can anyone offer advice? Thank you.",1541760716,11/9/2018 4:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9vjhab/request_how_to_talk_my_sister_out_of_extended/,6

540,9vjfvz,Requests: Struggling with self image,"This is a post asking for advise/help and a way for me to vent out my issues.

I follow a keto diet. I’m traveling in a foreign country currently and last night I ate the most delicious local cookies with milk and, alcohol &amp; creamed coffee. I indulged. I don't think it really classifies as a Binge, but it was quite a few calories. Obviously I broke ketosis, but I’ve been at this for over a year now and getting back in ketosis isn’t really my issue here.

I say this wasn’t really a binge, because I have binged before... and I do admit to have had a personal issue where I would try and fix the binge by purging. This happened roughly 3-5 times in a 2 month period early on the diet. I would stay keto on those binges, but just go crazy and overeat (typically induced by drunken liquor nights). I have since kicked out those certain foods/drinking that lead to the binges. I was too restrictive and it ultimately came crashing. Also important to note the binging was a result of naïve intermittent fasting combined with a strict diet. Just thought I could jump right in without consequences. Ironically, that lead me into “purposeful” fasting. At first I would fast as punishment, but it turned into a purposeful fasting strategy which Ive enjoyed and reaped the actual benefits. I have also studied a whole lot more and learned discipline, control, and understanding like Ive never before. I am aware and concerned for my mental health. I honestly think this stemmed from a bad breakup over a year ago which led me into dieting and overcompensating. Stress and the way the works plays a part.

Anyway, story continues. Here’s the kicker: Ive never been obese, “fat”, and especially never out of shape. I’m an athlete, and always have been. I’m bigger, but am muscular and have a vague six pack. I can run and lift beyond normal standards. I’m told I’m attractive and tinder is a fun little validation tool. I say all of this to lead into the fact that I cant stand looking in the mirror half the time. “Six pack not big enough”, “bloated”, “too bulky need to lean up”... “My ex wouldn’t think I’m attractive enough to miss me”, “I’m not going to be successful with work looking like this”.... etc... I think people would be shocked to hear of my issue.

So last night I cheated with the cookies. I felt absolutely terrible in the morning. The anxiety was causing concern and I thought that I should just fast it off I’d be alright, but my concern for my mental health took over. I was at war with myself over whether or not I should fast. I decided I needed to avoid the punishment route and eat a nice fat-healthy &amp; lite breakfast. That was about 8 hours ago. NOW The war is back. Not sure if I should eat. Not sure if I’m ruining my travel (I am at this point, at least for today. Seriously I stressed about this all day). Part of me feels like Ill be right back on track if I just push a fast until tomorrow (~24h) and get some workouts in at the terrible hotel gym (terrible workout setting makes this harder). Then I’ll get up, explore, and have an awesome local (&amp; keto) lunch. So now it’s: “I got over the binge/purge episode and I can get over this. Fight. Go through hell to make it out”. The other part of me is worried for my sanity, what would people think if they knew.. I feel even worse knowing that all of this is concerning and an outsider would be totally shocked by my conflict. I didn’t even bloat really, i still have abs, I still can run and lift a shit ton... but damn I still cheated and for whatever reason its ruined me and my vacation day in this awesome foreign country.

Ive learned so much from my bad habits and know I’m getting better. It’s a fight for sure. I’m expecting certain responses here, but also need to note that getting off keto/fasting wont happen. My life is generally better off and I have seen amazing results. But it is these temporary moment around cheating that make it insanely hard.

Does anyone have advice for me?

I’m a 20 year old male and for the past year or so I think I’ve been seriously under-eating due to depression and anxiety. Most of the time I just don’t feel like eating and when I do eat it’s usually just 1 fast food meal in a day and some crackers or almonds every so often. I recognize that this is not enough and yet somehow I just feel like I can’t change it. It’s daunting and overwhelming but I also feel like there are people who have it worse and because I don’t have body image issues and I don’t think about my weight I’m unsure if I need help or if it’s valid to seek it.

I would love that, I have learnt a lot of tools to make life easier (I am talking relationships, beliefs, bodypositivity, no diet or nutritive habits, this has never helped any food addict).

Feel free to PM me at /u/Masha_bouledevie

I wish all of you a great day

545,9yxhs1,Request: Help Me Prevent A Relapse (Chronic Illness + Fitness)?,"I'm almost 3 years into a very very fortunate, pretty issue-free recovery. I also have a chronic illness (poorly-controlled epilepsy, not-solidly-diagnosed autoimmune issue). I've been going through an extremely rough patch with my epilepsy lately, and I've also been trying to get back into fitness (because spending a lot of time immobile in hospital beds + back injuries from seizing have given me sciatica).

Basically, I feel very much like I'm out of control of my body and my life right now. Going to the gym has reintroduced me to people that really buy into diet culture and keep making casual body or food related comments. One comment about my body has set me off recently, and I've begun body-checking and obsessing about restricting (I've managed to prevent myself from restricting though). I used to use exercise to purge and punish myself, so just being in that environment has already been pretty hard.

I'm really not sure what I'm asking here. Does anyone have any advice for this kind of situation? How can I accept my lack of control? How can I get away from diet culture in a fitness setting? How can I stop body-checking and basically body-shaming myself?

I also feel like I'm too big (healthy weight) to be believed by a personal trainer or anyone else if I tell them I had an eating disorder. Which we all know is bullshit but I don't want to have to defend myself, so I've stayed quiet.",1542755570,11/20/2018 17:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9yxhs1/request_help_me_prevent_a_relapse_chronic_illness/,9
546,9yrbr1,Request: Am I Developing An Eating Disorder?,"I’m a 16 year old girl and I’m nervous that I may have a slight eating problem, but there are too many factors for me to understand if they are actual symptoms of an eating disorder.

I’ve never loved food or been a huge eater, but I have definitely always been within a healthy weight for my age. I’ve always had 3 meals a day, played travel softball, and essentially had normal eating and exercise habits. About 2 years ago, I started to have very severe depression and anxiety issues, but in the last 5 months I’ve been consistently doing well with those. I still see my therapist weekly and take antidepressants though. I also have ADHD and take medication for that which will come in later. I also had to have two major orthopedic surgeries in the last year, so I’ve stopped playing competitive softball. Lastly, my mom was anorexic in college and in the years following. Sorry if this is all random info, but I figured some of it may be important factors.

In the past few months, I’ve noticed my eating habits kind of slowing but nothing alarming at all. My ADHD medicine (concerta) got upped a tiny bit a few months ago, and I know that can cause appetite suppression, but this seems like more than suppression. In the last 2-3 weeks, I’ve gone from being a healthy weight to a few pounds underweight. Basically, I’ve noticed myself sort of obsessing over the cause and effect aspects of eating and loving the if I don’t eat, my weight will go down. Once it gets fairly low though, it’s obviously is harder to go down and it makes me panic because I’ve lost the control over making it decrease. Also, my medicine usually begins wearing off around 11 pm but recently I’ve noticed myself playing this weird mental game where even if I start to feel painfully hungry, if I can fall asleep and make it until morning (when I take my meds again) I have essentially “won”. My parents are definitely noticing and trying to force me to eat but I’m just scared of food and worried that if I eat one thing I won’t be able to stop. I also don’t eat healthy really either though, and will just have maybe one snack and half a meal of carbs or junk food a day for the whole day. I’ve started to feel faint, my legs shake, and I’m just exhausted. I know I’ll have to see my psychiatrist in a few weeks and she’ll weigh me too, but I’m terrified of trying to eat more before that but am also scared that she’ll take me off my medicine for losing weight and I’ll feel more hungry. I’ve started to see my heart beat through my stomach and stuff like that too, and I’m losing feeling in my pinky toes and some fingers at times. I’m overall a fairly picky eater and also went vegetarian about 6 months ago.

Sorry if this is a lot of random info but I’m just concerned and was wondering if anyone could give me their opinion. Thank you so much.",1542713055,11/20/2018 5:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9yrbr1/request_am_i_developing_an_eating_disorder/,2
547,9yrbd9,Request: Recovery Seems So Impossible,"i’ve been in treatment for 7 months now. between day program, residential, day program again, and intensive outpatient now since insurance kicked me out. i kind of just wanted people to talk too and get their perspective, since most of my friends in treatment are dealing with the same lack of motivation.

i really think my eating disorder is worse than it was before i went on residential. i don’t know what to do anymore. i cannot picture recovery, i don’t know what it looks like, and i can’t find any part of me that wants it anymore. i’m so depressed, and all my friends are doing senior year of high school stuff (i sound really pathetic) and i’m just in therapy doing online classes and i really just want to give up on it all.

i’m using different behaviors, and bingeing without gaining weight now, so i don’t understand why i should recover at all. i only went to treatment in the first place because i wanted to lose weight.... fucked up. but i just can’t find any motivation since i got home from residential in august. i’m so tired. it’s so mentally exhausting, and i don’t know where to start to try and find some motivation.

i don’t know where to start at all. it feels like every week i’m starting back at the beginning. i’m starting to think recovery is just not in the cards for me. i know ups and downs are common in recovery, but what do i do if i can’t find the things that make me want to recover, i don’t know why i would want too when this eating disorder seems to make everything better, even though it only makes it worse in the long room. it’s an endless cycle.

i know it’s there because i’m writing this now but i don’t know how to use it to get out of bed every morning. does anyone have any advice on how to get out of a no motivation funk during treatment? everything just seems so hopeless. if you read this, thank you :-)",1542712944,11/20/2018 5:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9yrbd9/request_recovery_seems_so_impossible/,2
548,9yrb0x,Request: I Got Myself Into A Restrict/Binge Cycle And I Have No Idea How To Get Out Of It,"I have a history of anorexia which I got treated for 2 years ago.

But now, dude. Medically I'm better but mentally this process almost feels even worse.

I don't know what to say, there is so much to say but basically my biggest fear is getting fat and hating myself. I feel like I look awful once I am over a certain weight. I don't own a scale but thanks/no thanks to my long history of anorexia I feel like I can see and feel exactly when I've gained weight and I have the calories of everything memorized. I cannot get numbers, information, size out of my head.

I'm currently underweight but have maintained for a long time, or so it seems, likely due to this cycle. I am terrified that if I just eat what I want, it will turn into binging out every day. Intuitive eating doesn't work, therapy doesn't work, doctors can't get through to me or change my mindset because in the past all I felt was anger towards people who tried to get me better.

So I restrict heavily, limiting myself to about half the calories a person of my size/age/gender needs per day. But of course this leads to binging eventually. Lately I've been binging once or twice a week and usually I purge too, mainly because I feel so sick from all the food I just ate.

Then I spend the next couple days feeling bloated and generally sick, then I get back to normal and am determined it will be the ""last time."" Newsflash, it never is the last time, the more I keep restricting, the more I'll binge. I don't know how to stop restricting. I am so strict and controlled on my ""normal"" days out of fear that if I don't, I'll binge.

I think I'm attractive, I have a good job, I'm starting college next year, I have things I like to do, some friends, a loving family, yet my mind is just fucked and I still turn to food to comfort me when I binge. It comes out of nowhere and it's always at night; I never binge during the day. I'm like a secret binger and I know that behavior is so weird, I legitimately hide candy/sweets/snacks in my room so nobody sees me taking all the food.

All I want is to be ""normal"" and not dominated by thoughts about food and size, but I would also be NOTHING without these thoughts because I can't be happy unless I'm skinny. I have nobody to impress, I'm single. I feel like for my own sanity I need to be skinny but my methods of doing so are also what drive me insane.

Professional help is out of the question, for many reasons, so I'm sorry if this is above y'alls paygrade. I just want to know if anybody has dealt with this successfully at home or if you have any tips to avoid binging or to stop restricting or how to get out of this painful loop. I am suffering and it's because of my own actions",1542712843,11/20/2018 5:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9yrb0x/request_i_got_myself_into_a_restrictbinge_cycle/,2
549,9yrajw,Request: Mom's baking triggers my bulimia,"So a little context. I (22m) was diagnosed with bulimia in December. I tried to talk about it with my mom during the holidays because she makes a lot during that time and baked goods, especially cookies are a huge trigger food for me.

She responded with ""well I'm not the one putting the food in your mouth."" I was too surprised to react at the time.

I toughed through the holidays with some slip ups and I thought things would get back to normal from there but she was then put on work arrest due to an arm injury in April and she's been baking and buying bakeries non stop since then.

The worst time was two months ago and I binged on cupcakes and tried to purge by throwing up. That was my first time trying to purge like that, as I usually do it via exercise.

I tried talking to her again two weeks ago and she said she would hide the bakeries from me, only to bake two some pies the next day and leave them on the kitchen counter.

I'm honestly just frustrated, and angry with her. She baked another batch of cookies yesterday and I just want to throw them in the garbage at this point.

553,9yr8d0,Request: How do I regain a normal relationship with food?,"Kicked a self-harming eating habit and lost the weight.. I still struggle every day. I don’t know what to do.

My trouble with food began roughly 2 years ago. I’d been living on my own for the first time and working a new country when immigration restrictions sparked a 3 year period for which I am not allowed work; this is when my problem with food began.

I had no idea how I was going to stay in my new country and be able to feed myself for the next three years. I felt I had to eat whenever I could and as much as I could, in order to sustain myself. This spiraled into a habit of overeating, until I eventually became addicted to using food to hurt myself.

I hated myself as I was doing it, I wished I would stop, but I felt completely out of control.

In the last 12 months, I’ve been able to lessen these episodes - something I was doing to myself violently each day is now just a hiccup once every 3-4 weeks - but getting to this point was so hard. I was weighing myself a few times every hour, I’d walk until I developed shin splints in attempt to offset anything I ate, and I was sleeping in my car so that I wouldn’t have access to a kitchen.

The whole thing has left me terrified of food and it’s put a huge strain on relationships with everyone around me. I feel isolated and I don’t know what to do now. Losing weight was my focus for a long time - it felt like that was what I needed to be healthy again - but I’m beyond a healthy range now and I’m worried about losing control in the other direction.

I started eating normally once my boyfriend (whom I had just started seeing) told me he'd probably find me even more attractive if I gained a little bit of weight (this was after I told.him I missed being my old weight). This was a huge relief for me as I had struggled with my body image and relationship with food. For about four months it was wonderful. I ate like normal, gained weight, and became happy with my appearance! I'm still happy with it.

However, after about four months my relationship with food soured, but in a COMPLETELY different way. Sometimes I think it's ARFID but I'm not sure. I just don't give a good God dang about food or eating. It's apathy bordering on dislike. There really aren't specific foods that I avoid or stick to like would happen with ARFID. I just don't give a crap and absolutely hate eating and gain literally no enjoyment at all from it.

I feel like this is unhealthy. I am at the same healthy weight but I go hungry for really long periods of time. Nothing ever really seems good or appetizing to me.even when I'm really hungry.

I don't know what to do. I miss enjoying food. I do cook a variety of things and try a variety of different foods but I don't care about any of it. It all still tastes the same to me as before, it's just that I don't care.

556,9yr752,Request: girlfriend has an eating disorder and I'm not sure what to do.,"So as the title says I recently learned that my girlfriend has an eating disorder and I'm not sure what to do.

I got worried about her over a month ago when she would start uncontrollably tensing all over, which honestly may or may not have been related, I'm not sure. The shaking did become pretty common and I'd tell her she should go to the hospital but she is pretty damn stubborn so she wouldn't go

I also just knew she hadn't been eating much, way less than she should be, like she would go days without eating. Later I learned that she knew how to make herself vomit and had indeed some that after eating intentionally because she ""felt fat.""

She tells me she hasn't intentionally made herself vomit in a while, but she has hit the point where she no longer has an appetite, and if she eats what most people consider a reasonable portion of food her body just makes her vomit.

I convinced her to go to the hospital, they gave her ivs and a ton of needles, which is good because she has spontaneously passed out before, and I'm guessing that was due to lack of nutritio

I also talked her into seeing someone, she wouldn't go to a therapist but she knew someone who works in that field that technically is capable of dealing with that stuff. Problem is I feel like they're not really helping her this far.

Her ""friends"" have made it worse. She talked to one of them about it and her friend told my girlfriend that she's not that skinny so she can't have an eating disorder...

When I was 19 I had my son and my body image since then has been a constant nagging pain for me after becoming overweight. This year has been one hell of a ride for me with anxiety and whatnot too.

Since May I have lost a lot of weight. I haven’t changed my lifestyle or anything though and didn’t intentionally diet or workout to lose the weight. I didn’t even think about how I lost the weight I was just too happy about losing those numbers on the scale. I’m now just under the weight I was before I had my son which is supposed to be my healthy size.

Yesterday was my sons 2nd birthday and I made a ton of food for the party. After the party was over, people started complimenting me on how good the food was and that’s when I realized I didn’t even know what it tasted like since I didn’t eat anything and then I started thinking when was the last time I did eat and realized it was going on 4 days ago.

The thing I’m confused about is when I was diagnosed with an eating disorder I was obsessing about food and counting calories non stop. I haven’t done any of those. I just don’t eat, it’s like I tell myself I’m not hungry and my body just agrees and goes with it. I don’t experience hunger pains that should remind me to eat, it’s like I have lost intuitive eating. Now I’m thinking about it though and I do recognize that it’s like I naturally reward myself when I don’t eat, like oh cool I look extra thin today so now I can wear that cute crop top and go drink a couple beers with some friends and somehow I naturally have an excuse to not eat when I go visit family or friends even though I hadn’t eaten prior to the visit. I’m sorry this post is confusing even for me but I just don’t know if this is a relapse because it’s not me obsessing about food. It’s just me telling myself I don’t need to eat and it just works. It’s almost too easy to just not eat and me being a single mom makes it even easier since I’m constantly busy. Also I don’t know if this is the same for anyone else but my mind tells me I don’t have a problem because I’m not scarily underweight like when I was initially treated for anorexia.

For example I am fine with rice, potatoes, oats, etc, I don't have an issue with carbs overall, but I won't eat bread since it would scare me too. I would feel too guilty if I ate it.

I’m trying to let that go but I find myself aiming to have my meals at certain times or later if possible, and I don’t know how to stop focusing on that and just listen to my hunger.

I am very easily influenced, I watch A LOT of food videos on youtube- mainly “what I eat in day’s”, cheat days, etc. It’s a big waste of time and I don’t know why I do it - probably just so I can compare my diet to theirs and either feel better or worse about myself- but I want to stop!

When I am with friends and they tell me they haven’t eaten lunch yet or that they have their lunch later in the afternoon, the first thought that comes to my head is “well if they can wait until that time to eat, then I should be able to wait” and I’ll change my acceptable eating time to that hour!!

It took me a a long time and many gastro docs testing me to finally figure it out. No doctor I've spoken to has ever heard of it. Psych or medical. I have gained much more control over it, but it spirals out of control when I'm stressed. It doesn't matter what is in my stomach. As long as it's something, if I'm anxious it's coming up.

I've struggled with my weight for a long time. I've been thin since sixth grade, when I was prescribed Adderall. I never ate lunch at school all the way through high school. When I didn't take the meds I would binge and binge and at that time I didn't have any signs of Rumination. No purging. I still do this. Sometimes I completely lose control and I can eat all day. Still will not Ruminate unless I'm stressing.

I've been on Vyvanse for three years now. And I found that it did not have the horrible nauseating feeling I got with Adderall. My weight was good. I could feel that I wasn't hungry, but I could tell myself that I needed to eat and it was totally possible.

Cut to six months ago. My job is... Hard. I'm pulled in a lot of different directions.

Lately I can go all day without eating. Sometimes three days at a time with only one meal. Right now I eat about once a day. Sometimes an apple. Yesterday it was a large meal from McDonald's that I ate in about 5 minutes. My husband pointed out that he feels he needs to make me food or get me food because if he doesn't I don't eat. My coworkers have been asking me if I'm on a diet. I've never dieted. My medication has been the same dose for three years.

I'm still thin but this one meal a day thing is tbh giving me indigestion issues. And I have to say more people than ever have been pointing out my weight. I don't meet the criteria for anorexia or bulimia... And rumination syndrome is a huge problem but it isn't causing all my issues.... I think.

I'm moody and tired and frustrated that all I can get out of medical professionals is ""Huh. I'll have to look that up."" I feel alone and many people around me all struggle with obesity and I feel they don't see what's happening to me as a problem.

Sometimes I find a lot of the existing rhetoric around eating disorders incredibly reductive, shortsighted, frustrating and misleading. For me, it's never been a matter of delusion, in that I don't look at myself in the mirror and see myself as fat or needing to lose weight. I'm not seeing something other than the objective reality of what's right there. And I don't romanticize thinness or think that I need to lose more weight. My problem is just the fact that I'm not a very attractive guy.

I hate people who spew nauseating positive affirmations about beauty being subjective or crap like how there's someone out there for everyone. There's nothing wrong in just being able to acknowledge that I'm simply not good-looking. There's plenty of other stuff that's great about me, stuff that I have no problems being confident about, stuff I know I'm objectively better than most people at. Being attractive is just not one of them. I'm very secure and comfortable with that reality. But I still wish I could change it.

I starve myself a lot. I don't binge and purge. I've been fortunate enough in my field of work to have gotten to a position where I can literally work 2 hours a day out of my bedroom and that's enough to sustain myself financially. As a result, I don't commute or go to an office or have ordinary nutritional requirements. I don't get light-headed or dizzy or faint when I skip meals, which I do quite often. In fact, about twice a month I do a 5-day water fasting diet (basically I eat nothing at all except water with a pinch of salt for 5 days - the first day is hard but then the body just starts relying on fat reserves for fuel and you don't feel hungry at all and your mind starts to work startlingly clearly, it's almost creepy how efficiency increases, and you lose a tonne of weight). And when I break a fast or come out of a radical diet, I never feel the need to overeat. I'm genuinely satisfied with a small, reasonable balanced meal.

But I'm not starving myself because I think I'm fat. I know I'm already a really skinny guy, my BMI is extremely low but not in the danger zone. I simply think I have an ugly round face and I hate the shape of it. All my efforts to lose weight are primarily aimed at getting back my razor cheekbones that I used to have in my teens. But somehow my body stores all its fat in just my face. I work out obsessively, to the point where I got so addicted to cardio that I bought an elliptical for my bedroom even though my building's gym is literally 30 feet away from my front door. I take a massive cocktail of supplements and vitamins every day, chug green tea like a lunatic. I even tried chewing a massive wad of gum for 6 hours straight just to burn fat off my face. And I am ready to straight up stab the next person who casually shrugs and tells me to just ""drink a lot of water"" or ""work out more"".

It's not about weight for me. I just feel ugly in my own skin. I try so hard to compensate for my appearance. I have great hair, I'm very well-groomed and well-dressed and well-read, but flat out ugly is one thing you just can't fix.

I would be perfectly comfortable and satisfied with my body if I had a belly or a big ass or even man-tits, because I know that for me it's physically possible to work those off one way or another. But there's nothing I can do to change how I look. So I just do what I can - try to accentuate desirable features, ie, sharpen them cheekbones. And nothing I do seems to work.

Does anyone have advice?

564,9xvkns,Request: Request: How Can I Eat More When I Have No Desire To Eat?,"I have a naturally fast metabolism, which means that it's really hard for me to put on weight (and insanely easy for me to lose it). A few years ago I had a really bad breakup and resorted to not eating as a way to cope. These days I don't feel hunger the same way, if at all, anymore. I've been to several doctors about it but they all keep telling me to ""just eat more"" eyeroll.

It's not that I don't want to eat, because I do. It's not that I think I'm overweight, I know I'm not. It's simply that I have no appetite. I could go all day without eating easily, and a lot of the time I do. Even when I've gone all day without eating, and cook myself a nice meal- as soon as the food is in my mouth it turns to ash and I suddenly have no saliva and I just can't swallow it so I end up spitting it out and throwing the meal away.

I've been drinking protein shakes as a way to try to maintain a somewhat balanced weight, however I would rather get the protein from a proper meal and I don't want to rely on it is much.

I want to know how I can feel satisfied and stop myself from binging when eating unhealthier treats.

I’ve gained some weight since I stopped the symptoms, it’s been difficult to see myself in the mirror but I’m relieved to had stopped it.

I’ve discovered a pattern that’s annoying me pretty badly. I’m basically having two weeks of “being myself” and two weeks where my urges kick-in full. These weeks alternate, one week I’m ok and the following week is a mess. Now I try to buffer those bad weeks by trying to be as present as I can, and to be aware of what is ACTUALLY happening in my head.

When I’m on my good week I usually eat pretty healthy, until satisfied and I truly enjoy it. When I’m on my bad week I refuse to eat healthy, I overeat until uncomfortable, and also, I avoid working out. Now my question, is there someone out there that has seen something similar?

I’ve gradually began thinking of throwing up after meals over the last couple of months, and tonight I finally decided to do it after noticing how bloated I felt and looked.

I don’t know what it is about me, but I always feel so much shame and disappointment at the end of the day when I think about how I didn’t treat my body right, didn’t exercise, didn’t eat well.

I grew up with a healthy lifestyle - played soccer for 15 years and was always in great shape. I’ve never had a healthy diet though, and it’s definitely caught up to me over the past few years of my newly sedentary, post-college life. Obviously starting to smoke marijuana to help cope with my anxiety and insomnia didn’t help. Conversely though, I can see how my anxiety and insomnia symptoms would improve if I worked out and ate better. Yet I’m too much of a cowardly jerk to do anything to change my wellness for the better. Too scared of having to give up the things that makes me feel better.

If you're not heterosexual, you're just being confised cuz of hormones. If you're whatever and not great, then you want to hurt everyone around you. Things like that.

I know I'm not 'fat' but I'm not 'skinny'. People say I'm athletic now? I was like 15 to maybe almost 20 lb heavier 2 or 3 years ago?

I love food?? Everyone tells me I do? I do but simultaneously I don't? If they didn't have any calories then I would? Sometimes food tastes great, but other times they're the worst.

It's not like I don't know the facts. Don't eat and you mess up your metabolism. But knowing the facts make it worse? So since I haven't eaten in a while and I screwed up my metabolism, I shouldn't eat much because they'll automatically become fat?

I don't know why I'm like this? I don't think it's to hurt myself? I punish myself other ways, but I realized I can't do that forever either, but when I get better at not doing that, my focus shifts hardcore to food? I either try my best to eat as little as possible or not at all. It makes me feel good. I like the feeling of being hungry. When I feel food in my stomach, I feel the urge to get rid of it. I feel my body converting it into fat. I don't always throw up. I try to let the feeling pass. I was sick for a while in which case I threw up everything I ate and drank for 2 and a half months because my swollen spleen was squishing my stomach thinking it was full. It feels good, but I like to have teeth and know how bad stomach acid is.

I always eat healthy. Sometimes I eat maybe one or two bites of junk food but I can't stand it. I hate sweets. The taste is awful. I avoid salty foods as much as possible. No seasoning. No sauces. No sugar. I must eat protein. Protein can't be made into fat. Less bread. Less rice.

I must be doing something right. People say I look skinnier, prettier than I was when I was younger.

I don't think I'm bulimic or anorexic. It doesn't fit. But I don't really understand any of it. I don't get how other people just eat anything? I've been obsessing more lately because I feel like I could pinch more fat on more parts of my body and I can't stop feeling gross.

577,a0jnpk,Request: Relapsed recently. Unsure of where to go from here.,"I relapsed recently and have been in a worsening restrictive cycle for a while now.

I’m unsure of where to go from here.

I’ve struggled with this my whole life and never found help. I’ve merely had times where I’ve numbed myself to it, tried to distract myself and ignore it to get by.

I’m in my early 20s. My therapist as a teen noticed my ED behavior and suggested treatment but I was in an abusive household where I never would have been able to go to that facility.

Flash forward to college. My freshman year, I was doing okay for a while actually, despite other struggles being insane. I hit a low though and ended up fainting in class twice during a presentation (most do not know this, because I was with friends when I was taken to urgent care, but I was in a restrictive cycle at that time, which is half the reason it happened). I’ve had numerous unexplained health issues that I found out later are partially caused by ED behavior.

I confided in my college counselor about my thoughts but was too ashamed to tell her about my behaviors - just like before. So just like myformer therapist, I mostly got the standard “love yourself” Pep talk and scary concern that I desperately tried to disarm out of shame.

As a child I was starved and malnourished because of my abusive mother who was poor and also has struggled with ED her whole life. When I moved to my fathers, that was the only time my behavior was noticed by a doctor and my family for the most part (other than my siblings at times). Since then, I have struggled finding help and have isolated myself more and more during low points of relapsing.

During college I was “caught” a few times, by different recovering ED friends. They tried to be accountability partners. Only one of them however was in a good place in their recovery, so oftentimes it ended up being very triggering and discouraging. However one of them has been a great encouragement and understanding source for me when she is not at a low herself.

After all the health issues I had my freshman year ( a mix of lung issues like asthma, pneumonia, anemia, mental health, etc) I had to get dozens of tests from various doctors and was put on heavy breathing meds. After being evaluated by a nurse in psychiatry, I was diagnosed with a couple of things. However, I was basically laughed off when my fears came up about my spiraling because I no longer looked like I had an eating disorder, like I did when I was younger. I wasn’t severely underweight at all, so I was merely patronized and dismissed for asking for resources to help me.

Since then I’ve been really scared to speak to anyone for fear of this happening again. I’ve even asked for a therapist and she won’t allow me to. I’m just told to call one of their free “life advice coaches”. I’m not sure where to go from here. I am drowning with no help and I just want some freedom.

578,a0jn4y,Request: Post Request: Getting Triggered Extremely Easily,"So, I've never been formally diagnosed with an eating disorder, but definitely struggled with disordered behaviour before - extreme restriction, obsession with food, extreme body hatred, wanting to get to a very underweight BMI.

What can I do?
Now I'm doing much better and I actively avoid things that I know are triggering to me, like the countless diet subreddits on here.

But even with trying to avoid triggers, I still get triggered so easily. Someone making a comment on my body (which is never okay, but once they've said it the damage is done). Diet talk at work. Seeing how my very skinny friend is always talking about wanting to lose weight. Coming across random comments on Reddit talking about IF, fasting, CICO and shit on a completely unrelated post. Seeing pictures of very skinny women on /r/all. Not wanting to wear my tight dress for going out because I feel bloated, and then seeing all these girls with flawlessly flat stomachs and crop tops.

When I'm in one of those situations, I literally stop breathing, my heart starts pounding and my thoughts go crazy. I immediately think that I'm too fat, that I should lose weight again, how could I ever think that I'm okay the way I am now? I'm a completely normal healthy weight, but it still is too ""fat"" when measured up against our beauty standards.

I have those intense reactions all the time to my triggers that are pretty minor to a normal person. I can't expect the world to cater to me because this isn't normal, but it still ruins my day and I don't know how to cope with those triggers.

585,a0048d,Request: Losing Weight While Recovering?,"I’ve been starting to actively recover from my ED (anorexia/bulimia/vigorexia), especially since I was diagnosed with fibromialgia. It has been especially hard: food used to be my comfort, and now dealing with everything feels harsh.

I want to lose some weight because, objectively, I’ve gained some weight (that could affect how much pain I get) since the last diagnosis: I was too focused on the pain I was feeling to work on my ED. It’s hard dealing with pain when I’m overweight and my self-esteem isn’t quite in a place where I can deal with chronic pain, establishing a healthy relationship with food and graduating from college. I don’t really know how to do that without recurring to my old bad habits: tracking calories, making a shitload of exercise and eating as little as possible.

I’ve been recovered for about five years but the holidays are also hard because my family is my biggest stressor and they just set me over the edge. Today we went for a nice dinner at a fancy restaurant, my sister and I got into it and I didn’t want to lose my temper in front of my parents so I excused myself to the restroom. When I got in there I just felt extreme sadness and anger so I purged. Everything I was feeling went away, my fullness went away, my anger, my sadness, everything.

590,9zrn4o,Request: Thoughts On My Situation?,"I'm in a bit of a weird position/situation, and I don't know how to feel or what to think about it. I would like some honest thoughts about it,, Apologies if this ends up being ridiculously long.

So, backstory. When I was in 10th grade, I was deeply depressed (and though I didn't know it at the time, traumatized) and self-destructive. I engaged in a lot of self-harm. I learned about eating disorders, specifically about how they basically wreck your body, and I became fixated on the idea of destroying my body from the inside out. And so, I started to (somewhat) starve myself, and then started to purge. This didn't last for a significant amount of time, and while it was happening it wasn't like, horrifically bad or anything, and that's because I wasn't doing it compulsively. I had to very much force myself to eat less, force myself to vomit, and as an already weak-willed person I couldn't force myself to do something that I felt no compulsive need to do for very long. I stopped after only 3-4 months.

Since that time, I ended up becoming close friends with a lot of people who happened to have eating disorders, and I learned in excruciating detail what it was really like. How they thought, what it did to their minds, how it warped their perceptions of the world and themselves. One of gym friends shared every last detail of her experience and her recovery. So I felt I understood eating disorders fairly well. I knew what it was ""like"", how people with them thought, how if manifested in them. That period of time in 10th grade obviously wasn't me having an eating disorder, it was me actively choosing to self-harm through disordered eating-esque behaviours. I never became fixated on weight, or how I looked, or believed that doing this would make me look and/or feel better. It wasn't about 'control' (due to childhood trauma I actually struggle with a desire to give up control over myself, if that makes any sense,,,), it didn't warp my perception of myself, and I didn't find the behaviours or their results gratifying in the way that many eating disorder sufferers do. And I had no issues whatsoever stopping my behaviours, because for me it was never a compulsion, it was an active choice.

Then when I was 18, following the death of my parents, I was starved by people who temporarily took me in. Very much against my will. After this, I developed PTSD from my horrific situation, and hunger itself became a trigger for me. I was so terrified of being hungry and feeling that terror again that I would eat constantly throughout the day. This went on for a while, no bigger issue besides the avoidance of my PTSD, until I reached a point where I was just........ I was in a really bad place. I was struggling horrifically with my self-hatred and my pain and my grief, and I couldn't get away with self-injury anymore, so..... So, I started to starve myself again, actively deciding to trigger myself as a form of mental/emotional self-harm on top of the physical damage I was doing. Eventually I lost my PTSD-related sensitivity to hunger, but from then on I would still go through brief periods of time where I would starve myself purely as a form of self-harm. Again, my thinking around eating/food itself didn't change, I didn't develop any warped ideas in my head about weight or appearance or control or how any of this would change me or my life or whatever, ect, ect. These periods were usually only a week to a month, and again I was Forcing myself to engage in this behaviour out of a desire to cause harm to myself, mostly in place of being able to self-injure.

This leads us up to the present.

I went through a period of starving myself very recently. Longer than usual, but nothing else strange. And then I started starving myself again (almost immediately after, in fact), in October. Usually when I go through these periods, I keep track of my calorie intake, out of curiosity of just how much I'm ""really"" starving/to see if I'm not just tricking myself into thinking I'm hungry/hurting myself when I'm actually eating plenty. And I give up when I can't stop myself from letting the number go back to normal-""healthy"" eating range. But this time I stopped counting...... but without..... Realizing it......... my disordered eating didn't really. Stop. I would eat okay-ish sometimes, but mostly I was avoiding food. I was hungry, but I felt this vague undercurrent of anxiety when I ate........ at first when it was a ""lot"", but now when I eat....... basically anything at all. I enjoy eating, I like food, I don't think eating is ""Bad"" or anything, but I. I dunno. When I get past the initial hurdle of stomach pains and Hunger Alarms going off in ym head, I feel weirdly......... calm, I guess..........? I go into this weird state I don't know how to really describe, like....... like float-y, weirdly gratified, kind of how I used to imagine being slightly high would feel. I had this feeling in the past, too, its not new. but before, once I ""cracked"" and ate normally again I quickly lost the desire to reach this state. This time, I was chasing it without even fully realizing.

I've started to feel queasy and unsettled with something in my stomach. Whenever I eat I feel happy/fine with the act of eating itself, but unsettled by the feeling of food in my stomach, and have the extremely powerful urge to vomit it up. The only reason whatsoever that I don't is because I completely lost my gag reflex back in 10th grade. Whenever I eat I'm obsessively preoccupied with the desire to throw up. And I mean obsessively. I want to eat and enjoy eating, as I always have.......... but whenever I eat now, I can;t stop ruminating on how much I want to empty out my stomach, on how much ""better"" I'd feel if I could, even though I fucking hate vomiting.

Y'know, I actually would need to gain weight, if I wanna look more the way I want to. And I'm mortally terrified of losing my hair, or damaging my teeth (if I ever figure out a way to re-activate my gag reflex or vomit without it). But I don't want to stop what I'm doing. I keep catching myself thinking, ""why am I DOING this?? why?"", but I dunno. I don't know. I want to stay in that float-y, 'high' feeling forever, I don't want to feel the unsettled rolling of my stomach when I have food in it. I find myself turning away food without meaning to, without thinking about it. I don't want to stop, suddenly.

Which brings me here. I feel...... very confused. I didn't...... and still don't have a lot of the symptoms of eating disorders, y'know? I still don't think ill of food or eating in general, I still don't fear eating in front of others, I still don't fixate on my weight, I still don't believe that starving myself or losing weight or looking a certain way will change or improve or ""fix"" anything in my life, and it's really not..... that bad. At least at this point. I feel bad even saying I'm ""starving"" myself, when it's not even remotely as bad as when I was being starved against my will, and not even remotely as bad as how most people with actual eating disorders have it.

I feel disgustingly guilty and rude even being here, describing all this and asking for thoughts. I feel like I'm disrespecting people who actually have eating disorders and are suffering by even suggesting my problems are in any way comparable or on their level. And like I have no right to be alarmed or make any note of it when I haven;t been this way for a significant amount of time, and am not doing nearly as badly as other people. I feel like I'm making a big deal out of nothing. There surely are other factors, other explanations. My stomach is fucked up from my generally unhealthy diet, which is why I feel so sick when I eat....... I'm just anxious in general and that's making me feel ill............ I'm surrounded by people with eating disorders so I'm just paranoid.............. ect, ect, ect,,,

And I feel like even if there is some kind of Problem, I sort of brought it on myself for actively choosing to engage in disordered eating behaviours as self-harm. Like, ""this is what you get for being so disgustingly disrespectful to people with actual eating disorders"".

And. I also don't want to stop. Typing that sort of sent of chill through me, but I'm realizing it's true. I don't want to stop. Maybe I'll ""crack"" soon and everything will go back to ""normal"" and nothing will have really changed and I'm just delusional...... I'm going to feel real damn humiliated with myself if that happens. But something feels Wrong. And I feel strongly at this exact moment that I do not want to stop.

Sorry for how ridiculously long this was, but thank you for reading it. Mostly I think I just needed to say it, to get it out there, but I really do want to hear what other people think of this,,, Am I being ridiculous? Am I just a fucking idiot? Am I being rude and disrespectful to people who are actually suffering? (and if I am, I am genuinely so, so sorry, and I won't talk about this anywhere again.)

I don't even know If I want to ask for 'advice' or anything. ""What you're Doing is still unhealthy either way, so it doesn't Matter whether you have an eating disorder or not! Go talk to someone about this!"" Is sound advice and probably the 'right' response, but I feel so......... so guilty, I would feel horrific talking to someone about this when it could just be a 'false alarm' sort of thing, I don't want to make it seem like I'm trying to seem worse than I really am. Does that make any sense??

I don't know if anything I've said makes any sense,,, What do you all think?",1543004123,11/23/2018 14:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9zrn4o/request_thoughts_on_my_situation/,1
591,9zrlau,"Request: thanksgiving trigger(s), please advise","I have been in a bad spot for a few weeks now if I’m honest. Isolating myself, eating almost nothing habitually, allowing myself to pay more attention to my disordered thinking patterns. I felt like I was finally coming out of that the past day or two. I went grocery shopping even to try to get myself interested in food again somehow. My appetite is almost entirely gone and I cannot stop the thoughts and urges. The feelings I try to ignore bubble up until it breaks me and I wind up at ground zero all over again. If I’m honest, the only reason i ever seem okay is usually that I do everything I can to numb and distract myself at all costs from the thoughts feelings and urges that accompany my symptoms. I try to ignore them and cover myself. Avoid looking at myself even as much as I can. And then a photo is taken of me without my knowledge and all I want to do is throw up or eat even less to feel better about myself somehow. I feel so entirely trapped in this body that I hate so deeply I cannot handle it. I feel so suffocated and disgusting and I have never not felt this way. I don’t know what to do. Whenever I finally did try to talk to people about it, I get either extreme pity / concern, which makes me feel horrible and pathetic/ like a burden/subhuman, or my ED friends who have figured it out have either ridiculed me or tried to help while relapsing themselves often. Like we’d have the best of intent to help one another, but oftentimes talking about it makes it more real for me, and I find myself triggered and ashamed. Especially looking at this person I care about and feeling even worse about myself because they’re more thin and beautiful than I could ever hope to become. A lot of the time I’d end up at a new low and she would try to help me, and then I’d do the same for her. There was good about it but I feel scared to tell anyone anymore, even her. I no longer have anyone around me who has an eating disorder, since leaving college, and I feel horribly alone. I don’t know what to do. I keep trying to hide it because anytime I allow myself to speak on it or even feel it, I fall even deeper into it every time. Tomorrow I’ll be at my boyfriend’s families for thanksgiving and truth be told I couldn’t be more afraid. It’s a minefield for me (I am also PTSD/ADHD, and often get overwhelmed with anxiety and sensory overload at these events), lots of people in one room all eating excessively and I have to eat in front of them. I have to eat my specific diet in front of them. I have to look the way I do, while eating, in front of them and my boyfriend. Tonight I spent an hour in front of the mirror after an hour in front of the toilet trying desperately not to purge or break my mirror. I feel so ashamed and alone.

Does anyone have advice for me?

594,a3ib7o,Request: looking for support,"I have a long history with bulimia - 10ish years with some breaks of semi recovery in between (by semi recovery I mean just not “practicing” symptoms - the thoughts never go away lol). I’ve also had some periods of just excessive restricting, more so in my teens.

Anyway, I had been doing well for the last 7 months. No bulimic episodes (I was a huge binge-purger). I was never underweight with bulimic, just a high average. Stopping caused me to gain weight (enough that I’m technically overweight), but I’ve been doing a lot of work just accepting it and focusing on incorporating real healthy habits while my body adjusts after so many years of poor choices. With this weight gain my doctor actually sent me to a weight loss clinic (as I was getting very poor circulation in my legs) and I was actually prescribed Saxenda which slows digestion but suppressed appetite. I should have mentioned my history to her, but the Saxenda has been helping with my binging. (I’ve never been admitted for an ED, but I do have a therapist I see regularly)

Recently my student loans went up $200 win no notice due December 1st. I found out on November 22nd and because rent was due it wiped out my food budget. It was fine while I had some food at home, but eventually I started fasting because I literally could not afford to eat. I’m not typically that broke so I didn’t bother asking for money or going to a food bank etc. I haven’t eaten anything in the last 48hours and it makes me sad because it feels so good to be doing it again. I’m just filled with obsessive thoughts of everything I could binge on when I get paid tomorrow and I’m so nervous this has thrown off my really good behaviour towards eating.

I guess I’m looking for support. I just haven’t been able to talk about it with anyone. All of this control is making me feel out of control and so overwhelmed.",1544054762,12/5/2018 18:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/a3ib7o/request_looking_for_support/,4

596,a3iahw,Request: How can I best care for my SO?,"Sorry, I don't suffer from an ED, but I love someone that does and I wanna do the best I can to help. This is gonna be kinda long. Just read the bold sections if you don't have time.

I've been dating this person for a while now. They had struggled in the past with Anorexia, but had pretty much been on a downward spiral. Soon enough, the only time they would ever eat was with me, which meant fasting for days at a time, accompanied by purging pretty much after every meal, and excessive exercise (I don't think exercise is bad, but this was excessive which is obviously problematic)

Eventually, things had gotten bad, and they told one of their parents. Not long after, they had gone to a clinic specializing in eating disorders, gotten an official diagnosis of AN, with a recommendation of inpatient or residential treatment, and appointments with a nutritionist and a therapist. Unfortunately, they decided not to do residential/inpatient...

It's only been a few weeks since then though, meaning only a few nutritionist/therapist meetings, but it feels like it's spiraling out of control more than ever now. I just have a few questions so I can learn how to best help this person however I can.

**Eating**: They have to have supervised meals. Some of these are with me, because, well, it seems like the only time they'll ever eat somewhat normally is with me, but there's more to that. Sometimes they straight up won't eat. If we eat out, they always go for the lowest calorie options. So uhh, questions.

* They've started trying to lie about and hide food. Hiding in sleeves/waistband, spitting out in napkins/tissues. Sometimes to stop this, I feel like I have to be stern. It's like I have to baby them and always be on guard and call them out for it when I see it. I don't want to do this; I want them to feel normal around me, but I'm worried I'm only making it worse. **Do I just let this behavior slip? Do I keep watching/stopping this from happening?**

**Relationships:** Since they started having supervised meals, their relationship with the parent I mentioned before has become... strained. They used to be close, but now it feels like their ED is making them abusive towards that parent- always starting fights, using insults and things I'd never thought my SO would say to anyone ever. I want my SO to try and fix this, but they can't. It's like they aren't even in control, and I'm *extremely scared that their ED is gonna do that to me too...*  **Is it right to urge them to try and fix this? The parent isn't going anywhere but it'd be so much more comfortable. Can anything even be done? The SO says they know they shouldn't but can't stop for some reason, and I just don't understand...**

**Control:** It straight up feels like my SO has lost control of their life. Whenever they're eating, or thinking about exercise, or purging, or losing weight, or anything that their ED wants them to do, it straight up feels like they aren't even there. A lot of times they'll go on to say how much they don't wanna get better, and how they're not sick enough, or not thin enough, and that thought process scares me. It's like they aren't even thinking for themselves. **Do I have the right idea with this, that it's not even them in control? What can I even do about this? They straight up ignore and dismiss everything I say when they're like this and I don't know what to do...**

This is going on way too long, so a few final questions:

* **Is there anything I can/should do to stop them from viewing/creating pro-ana content?** They have accounts on [several apps and sites] dedicated to seeing that stuff, and it scares me.

* **What do I do/say when they say they don't wanna get better?**

* **With a case as serious as this, should I just be patient? I feel like I'm not doing enough, but I also feel like I can't do anything.**",1544054633,12/5/2018 18:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/a3iahw/request_how_can_i_best_care_for_my_so/,6
597,a3i86g,Request: Diagnosis Please!,"Hello, I am an 18 year old male who was been having trouble with eating

When I was young I ate very little, I remember the teachers at my school and my parents getting together for a conference multiple times. Teachers would pull me aside during lunch and tell me I needed to eat more, after my parents divorced and my dad fell out of my life I remained eating very little. One year in about 8th grade my mom brought me to a new counselor, I had seen like 10 by this time for numerous reasons including eating. My older brother was overweight at this time and it scared me and I did not want to be overweight as he was. By the counselor and doctors I was told I needed to eat more or else I wouldnt grow and so i started to. I ended up eating way too much after a couple months of starting to eat more and ended up slightly overweight. This remained like this for about a year until my sophemore year when I became obsessed about weight. I starved myself eating a small number calories a day, resulting in my losing about 50 pounds to become thin, but in the normal range. I have been working out my whole life and I would sometimes go over my budget. If I did this I would then run super late at night to try to get rid of those calories. This was on top of me already lifting weights for a couple of hours that day. 

I did this calorie restriction for about a year, slowly starting to eat more, but still a small amount, until I got a girlfriend. I wasnt happy with my body I still felt fat, but I wasnt extremely scared about weight as much as I was before. When I got my girlfirned I couldnt get hard most of the time because I wasnt eating much and my girlfriend wanted to have sex but I tried to hide the fact that I wasnt able to because of eating. I started to eat more while lifting and running and sports everyday, I was then able to become hard and maintained weight a little higher for a while. When we broke up I stopped eating again completely going extremely restrictive again, not eating anything when I would eat out and my family would constantly nag me all the time about eating but I was always scared to eat anything and would feel extreme guilt if I ate more than a limit I set for myself. I would take laxatives my mom had and tell her I needed them because my intestines were messed up and that I couldnt use the bathroom (which was partially true because I wasnt eating much i would use the bathroom about once per week on average). I thought it would help me eat less and it made me feel more slim and that I didnt have any extra weight on me. I forgot to include this earlier but I would weigh myself 6 times a day at least and if I ever over ate and couldnt go for a run due to not having any energy I would make myself puke multiple times per day and this is how I have been ever since. I only make myself puke 1 time per week on average maybe less I due it after eating over my limit for a meal, which is pretty rare but I still sometimes try to puke after feeling bad about eating a whole protein bar or something. 

I then got another girlfirend a couple months after the first one and I broke up, I didnt have any problems similar to what I had before (erectile dysfunction) , but I felt very comfortable with her and we were both very into dieting but getting the nutrition we needed so i started to eat more because I was so comfortable with her, but I still made myself puke and overexercised a lot. My weight never went past a limit I set. Me and my ex broke up about 2 months ago and when we first broke up my friends took me out a lot to eat some food so I did, but I would never eat too much and if I did I would make myself puke. I remember one time they brought me to a burger shop. I looked up the calories for my meal saw it was high, then I felt sick and I didnt even need to make myself puke I just did because of how I felt. I have been eating a small number of calories per day in addition to working out everyday since. I track every calorie I eat including gum I chew and I feel hungry a lot of the time. I have trouble eating so I tried to take zzquill ever since I had this for the past year or so with sleeping, but when I saw how many calories it countained i just ended up taking sleeping pills instead, but I still wake up after a couple of hours and either take another one and try to sleep or just stay up with about 4 hours of sleep. I am constantly tired but my stomach hurts too much to sleep a lot of the time. sometimes ill stay up and get no sleep because it burns more calories or so I thought until I did some reasearch but eventually ill get insanely tired and just pass out. I know my problems are coming back and started to be bad and I see that but I dont want to go out to a clinic and get help, its kinda sad to, id rather just find help through hear as to what to do exactly. I might have missed some things but I know I am rambling already and I dont want to make this longer than it is so I will stop there. I guess I am asking for some help as to what to do and if you think I have a disorder or not, because I was never officially diagnosed with anything. I talked to some of my friends about it, that have known i have had this problem and they tell me I need to eat and tell me exactly what to eat, but I sometimes lie to them about what ive eaten and dont take their advice much.

PS: I still have a decent amount of muscle and I am scared about losing it because I would be even more ashamed about my body. I want to fix it before I lose this muscle as well, even though I have already started losing a lot of it.

598,a384pf,"Request: I Have Disordered Eating, Does That Make It An Eating Disorder?","I’m 25F, and have been up and down with my eating since I was a kid. When I was 11, my dad and stepmom got a divorce which hit me really hard (funnily my mom and dads divorce did not have nearly the same effects). I was caught in the middle, and my relationship with my dad (which was already becoming increasingly emotionally abusive before the divorce) took a nose dive. He moved in with the woman he cheated on my step mom with, and didn’t contact me for 8 months. When we finally were back in contact, I began going to his new house every other weekend. His new girlfriend was a health nut, and I didn’t like any of the food in the house. This is where it began.

I started just saying I wasn’t hungry because I hated the food. But over time I guess it sorta became my “thing” to not eat when I went to my dads. I only did it there, and was back to my normal habits when at home with my mom. My dad noticed, and I guess I liked that his concern wasn’t me just being picky. That never even occurred to him, he would always just comment that I barely ate.

I began dieting when I was 13, and it became obsessive. The most bland foods, weighing myself every day, after I ate any morsel of food. I would obsess periodically, but then in grade 10 I had a huge falling out with my best friend since kindergarten, and I began to starve myself. It had nothing to do with my weight or body image, I just liked the feeling of being empty and tortured. My insides felt the way my emotions did, and I loved it. The periods of starvation didn’t last long, I didn’t lose any weight, and I would sort of go on these starve/binge cycles. I never went a day without food, and I usually kept my caloric intake at a regular amount. I just liked when I consciously made the decision not to eat, or to put off eating til later. I liked when my friends noticed that I wasn’t eating- it was like they were confirming my decisions and validating the way I felt inside. This sort of subsided by grade 11 when my life balanced out a bit and I established a whole new group of close friends.

Once I got to university, I gained a lot of weight in my first year. I had no control over the food I was eating, and I ate fast food every day (was on an amazing meal plan at a school with “amazing” food options, I.e., lots of fast food). I remember getting pizza and then on the way back to my dorm, stopping at Popeyes for a few biscuits to eat on the side of my pizza lol. When I returned to school the following year (on the same meal plan again), I vowed that I would not go so out of control. I stayed away from fast food, but indulged on occasion. I lost so much weight and I felt really balanced at the time. Looking back though, I distinctly remember so many nights where I didn’t eat. Or I would restrict after I indulged in a burger and fries.

This is also where I discovered that if I was feeling stressed about things out of my control, I would restrict. But if I was feeling bad about myself, I would say “fuck it” and binge.

I feel like these habits have never really left me. Very rarely do I have a properly balanced day of eating. I’m always skipping breakfast and I won’t eat until I’m absolutely starving. But then it feels like my body rejects the food because I spent so long being hungry. I still love that feeling of being empty, and the longer I go without eating, the better I feel about myself. Again, this isn’t a weight loss thing (even though I am a little overweight), I just like the way it makes me feels about myself. I am also getting into this terrible habit where I like to smoke weed and then eat all kinds of stuff. It’s like having the munchies is an excuse to eat. As if the calories and nutrition don’t matter when you’re high. I also will put off eating sometimes until I can get high and eat, because it will taste sooooo much better and make me happier. I love eating when I’m high.

I know these are all patterns of disordered eating, ive just never sought help because I feel like there aren’t any distinct symptoms of a specific eating disorder, so people won’t take me seriously. However I have just started therapy to deal with anxiety and depression, and I’m thinking of mentioning this stuff to my therapist. 

Would this be EDNOS or am I just completely oblivious to obvious symptoms I have of other disorders? Thank you to anyone who took the time to read my story!!",1543979215,12/4/2018 21:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/a384pf/request_i_have_disordered_eating_does_that_make/,3

600,a2zjne,Request: Freaked Out Boyfriend.,"Hey all. 31/f

—

I just started dating this amazing guy about two months ago. Seriously, love at first sight. We have been inseparable. Said the L word within the first three weeks.

However, he guessed pretty fucking fast that I had issues with food. He even came out and asked. “Do you have anorexia?” Like, what am I supposed to say? I can’t lie to someone I love like that. So I said yes.

He got really worried for me and didn’t know what to do. So he suggested that he come with me to a therapy session to learn how he can best support me. He was praised a lot from my therapist because he’s actually doing a lot correctly out of the gate. I’m grateful.

However, after that therapy session, we went and got pizza. During our date we swapped IDs for fun. He said I looked great in my picture and my dumbass just goes, “Yeah, that’s my high weight”. And his eyes just like bugged out of his head. He got so bummed out. Like it hurt me in my heart to see him so sad. I could tell it really hit a nerve with him.

I assured him that I’m working extremely hard to get back to my weight, but I can tell he finally figured out just how sick I am.

(Also, side note - my best friend started splitting up from me about 2 months ago ((when I accidentally started losing weight)) and came out and told me that my ED is why she’s backed off; that she can’t watch my self destructive behaviors.)

Then last night he sat down with me and told me how hard of a time he’s having with the whole thing. He said it isn’t breakup town, but that we have a lot of work to do if we’re going to stay together.

So here I am without a friend, and my boyfriend is freaked out.

What on earth do I do? I’m seriously alone. Everyone is abandoning me. Does anyone have any semblance of compassion?

I don’t know. I guess at this point I’m venting, but I could use some advice here.

Also, if anyone is in their 30s and SERIOUSLY recovery minded, I’d love to swap phone numbers / kik / whatsapp for a texting buddy.

Anyway, that’s all I guess. Thanks for reading.",1543919701,12/4/2018 4:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/a2zjne/request_freaked_out_boyfriend/,15

I used to struggle with an ED and would consider myself to have been in recovery for nearly a year now. I managed to get myself to a place where I could eat food without fear or guilt and had a positive mindset about my body and weight gain. 

My girlfriend has an eating disorder and we used to trigger each other so I stopped telling her anything about how I was doing because it would cause issues in our relationship. She was the reason I wanted to get better and she supported me the whole way. Recently I have felt old thoughts return about my body, weight gain, and fear foods. I don't act on any of the thoughts and wouldn't out of fear of making her worse. I don't know if I should tell her or not that I've been thinking this way again because I don't want to trigger a relapse for her since she's still struggling with her ED. I don't have friends or family I could talk to about this so any advice anyone may have is greatly appreciated. 

Is it worth telling her about these feelings if I haven't acted on them and don't plan to? We tell each other everything but I don't know if the risk is worth it here. Thanks in advance for any help, I'm so grateful this subreddit exists.

602,a2v6h5,Request: How do you find the strength and drive to recover form a eating disorder?,"I've never cared about my appearance, I don't wear make up, go to the air salon or even paint my nails, but I would like to loose weight for my health, and I don't know where to find the strength and discipline needed to smooth out my stress eating that lately I have let get out of hand. 

I had been pretty heavy since I was young, I didn't have unhealthy eating habits, but when I was about seven years old I had a very serious health condition that have been managed with loads of cortisone and steroids that had me put a lot of weight in a very short time span, along with giving me lots of contraindications, but I guess it kept me alive. As soon as my health was under control my parents especially my mother had me go to lots of specialists and dieticians, and I think I've been on a diet everyday up until I could decide for myself like when I was fourteen or fifteen. 

Anyway no matter how strict my diet was I never lost any weight, and I grew impossibly exhausted of always having to measure and be conscious of every bite I took, so I quit. I have so many bad memories of not being able to wear what I wanted and my parents to constantly comment on my appearance that I had enough, I didn't care. When I turned eighteen my mother pressured me to try and go on a diet again, I was about to start uni and she lead me to believe that I needed a fresh start and that it would be increasing harder to loose weight as I got older. So obviously it didn't take at the beginning, I expected as much failure was a staple for me, until I tried medically monitored fasting, it didn't take long and finally I saw some results, after two or three months of on and off fasting I finally was at a weight that I would consider normal and I was allowed to stop. I obviously hated the process, it was really stressfull, as any high school student I was a social smoker, but with the stress of the incoming graduation and the not being able to eat and always being tired it really stuck with me. 

As you may imagine as soon as I got back into eating normally the shit hit the fan. My metabolism took a really bad hit. It didn't help that I got really depressed when I got into uni, since I hated the environment and couldn't take the stress... I endured it and kept my weight in check for about two years, even tough my mental health was deteriorating. When I couldn't take it anymore and dropped uni it all went down fast I gained my weight back, it took a little while but I accepted myself and got back on track re-enrolling in a different uni and I really stopped caring about my weight. 

Unfortunately nearing the end of my second attempt at getting a degree the stress got to me and gained a little bit more weight, it didn't help that I had an other health thing that prevented me from going to the gym and being a little bit more active... Anyway I got trough it and decided to follow back a diet that the hospital gave me and that fucking sucked balls even harder, because I was really set into getting back to being healthy but instead following that I ended up gaining even more, so for a year I cut everything in half and I got back into the mentality that I had to be conscious of every bite and after a while I can say that it gets very tiring, especially if you see next to no results. So I dropped everything and let loose, now I eat more than I ever did before, and I'm at my heaviest and I can't take it anymore. 

I just don't have the strength or the drive to cut the bad habits out, it doesn't help that I'm also trying to quit smoking, that just pumps up my hunger and I end up eating a lot of empty calories whenever I'm on a smoke free period, which just lead me to Jojo even more... I've always been fat, but I always prided myself in having a pretty healthy lifestyle, but now I've become ashamed of how I eat. I just don't know what to do. 

I'm sorry if I spammed you with the story of my life, but I guess to me the ups and downs of my weight are inherently connected with my mental state.

I’ve been weight restored and have been okay at meals, portioning my own food to where I’m eating enough. However, I’ve always struggled with eating freely... like snacking more than once or eating when I haven’t portioned it out. I’ve been pushing myself to try different snacks and eat at non set snack times and stuff and it’s been going okay, except the past several days I don’t know how to stop. My mom bought these really good sweet potato chips and I’ll start eating them and then I can’t stop. I’m eating from the bag and I’ll just keep on going back for more and end up eating half the bag in a few minutes. I tell myself it’s good I’m trying to eat normally but I just have this intense guilt and panic once I can finally stop. I can’t stop thinking about all the calories that I ate quickly and how I would never “slip” like this when I was deep in my ED.

606,a2dxmb,Request: bad relationship ended in what I think is an undiagnosed eating disorder. How do I move forward?,"About 2 years ago, I was in a relationship with a guy who made me feel awful about how I looked. I already had shockingly bad self body image, so it ended up in me barely eating and losing a lot of weight. I believed I was overweight, fat, even after the weight dropped.

Eventually we broke up, just over a year ago now, and my eating got better for a while. I put weight back on but I didn't mind so much; he was out of my life and I could move on. A couple months ago, however, my mental health got shockingly bad again, and my bad eating habits returned. My weight has dropped off again, and I have no desire to eat. The foods I used to love I can't stand, I feel bad eating, feel sick, and my stomach hurts every time. I live off less than a meal a day, not even that a lot of the time.

I haven't gone for help, or received a diagnosis for anything, not the eating, not the depression, not the anxiety, not anything. I feel like they'll tell me it's all in my head and there's nothing stopping me just being happy, or eating. I know I've done this to myself but I don't know how to change.

The reason I'm writing this, is for the extreme guilt I feel about how I look. I get compliments about my figure and refuse to accept them, because in my head I'm still as overweight and ugly as I always thought I was. I don't deserve to be complimented on how I look because I don't function correctly as a human to look the way I do. I'm failing at living, at being safe and healthy, but people just assume I'm naturally slim. I want help but I'm too afraid to go and get it. How do I move forward? How do I make steps to get better, to make it so I can accept myself for who I am? How do I start functioning correctly and caring for my self properly?

History: diagnosed when I was in the 4th grade as anorexic. Went to several hospitalizations, PHPs, IOPs, and inpatient. Recovery never really stuck for me. But whatever.

Today I work at a gym. It's extremely triggering. Especially when people ask me for advice (customers) on how I stay so skinny. What am I supposed to say? I starve myself so I stay thin? Yeah no. But my coworker actually asked me the other day if I had an eating disorder, like just out of nowhere. And I was floored. How did she know? Turns out shes in recovery from one too. And she took note of the fact she never saw me eat.

Second thought: I just got back about a month ago out of a detox facility where i stayed for 6 days to come off everything (i use substances and other things to control my appetite and kinda had a mental breakdown from everything i was on). So ever since i got out all of a sudden EVERYONE knows that i detoxed and now they probably just think I'm a junkie or something. But everyone's been commenting on how much weight I've lose and telling me i need to put weight on blah blah blah.

I dont know how to feel about these comments. In a way I kind of like them. A part of me wants to be SO skinny that people can tell I'm anorexic. Kind of like I want them to know that im hurting and not okay without having to come out and say it you know?

I've encouraged her to confront him about it, but she's scared to, even though she knows how dangerous this could be.

She has had eating problems for a very long time (the purging started a few weeks ago) but she has been faint and dizzy and weak for longer due to not eating. She lives with me on most weekdays so I usually try to ensure she eats as she has never told me it’s triggering before, instead telling me that she just doesn’t feel hungry often and that she wants to eat but forgets/needs the push.

Last night, she was nearly fainting as she hasn’t kept anything down in a week. She already has migraines which make her dizzy and I was concerned. She’s 18, and I doubt her family would have been supportive at 1 am, so I did my best to keep her from purging. I stayed up with her until she fell asleep. She kept saying that I hated her for not letting her purge but I told her that I love her and I knew she couldn’t see it then but I still had to be there for her beyond what she wanted right then.

I thought this was the right thing to do, but upon checking online after falling asleep, I found many people telling me that I shouldn’t try to stop her from purging. I understand the worry about driving her away. Honestly, I’m just trying to keep her safe until she schedules an appointment with her therapist in the next few days.

Did I do the right thing by staying up so she couldn’t purge in my bathroom, or am I making things worse? Input from those in recovery and those who have been caretakers before would be a godsend.

Even though I’m eating less, the thing is that I’m not forcing myself to starve; I’m just not that hungry anymore for some reason. I’ve eaten 3 small meals in the past 3 days but I was still able to do my jiu jitsu and karate classes, I feel fine. The only side effects I’ve been having are slight dizziness/ headaches, and I think I’ve been more irritable.

Like I said, I’m not trying to starve myself, it’s just happening. I do like how I look when I haven’t eaten, but I’m not trying to not eat so I can lose weight (because I know that the body stores fat when you don’t eat).

Well, I was watching a youtuber with AN and she was talking about some lies anorexia told her, and she mentioned like 2 things which I was believing to be true (not eating if drinking at night etc). I don't feel guilty if I have a Snickers or anything, and sometimes I even exceed my calorie intake and do not feel bad about it. However when that happens when Im sober I feel kinda shitty. I also do not starve as much as I used to. So I was wondering if anyone could let me know if I should seek help or just keep my eyes opens for these patterns.

619,a5h3o6,Request: 14f. Struggling,"im 14f and borderline underweight. recovery is fucking hard, let’s be honest. i guess you can say i’m in ‘recovery’, but i’m not fully committed. there are days where i eat healthy amounts of food but i would always feel bad afterwards. let me start from the beginning. i’ve been struggling with anorexia nervosa for a little over two years now. it all started when i decided to lose weight in march 2016. i was overweight then and was extremely insecure about myself and how i looked. i didn’t want to be the fat girl anymore. i didnt want to be unpopular, shy or hated anymore. people didn’t talk to me because i was so quiet. i thought losing weight would make me popular. i thought i would become more confident. sooooooo i bought myself a scale. 12 march 2016 marked the start of my weight loss journey (yes, i still rmb the exact date). at first, progress was slow. i only lost a little bit of weight in the span of a few months. so i decided to restrict even more. till the point where i was losing a lot more weight per month. a sick part of me still secretly wishes i can lose weight as easily now. just that now i have a lot less to lose :|. by the end of 2016, i had lost quite a bit. i thought i would be satisfied then. but i wasn’t. 2017 was the start of a new school year at a different school. i let my eating habits get the better of me. i was still obsessed with losing weight. in just a few months, i had lost even more weight. i had a really low bmi at my worst. (i’m rlly sorry if this is triggering for some of y’all out there ;-;) around mid year of 2017, i was kinda done. i was SO done with being weak and tired all the time and not being able to do anything. i had no strength. i couldn’t run. i wanted recovery. it wasn’t that smooth, id have to say. i only managed to gain a few kg back before i went back to restricting - not as compulsively this time though. when the end of year holidays started, i was back up to the weight i was at the end of 2016. that number was so fucking high. so. fucking. scary. and at that moment i knew that i just had to lose that weight. so i set a new goal for myself - quite a unreasonable goal tbh. i began running every other day and on the days i don’t run, i would do exercises at home for OVER AN HOUR. and it’s not just simple exercises. given my lack of strength last year, those exercises were hard as hell for me. painful as well. basically i made my holidays a living hell for myself in an attempt to reach my desired goal. sooo in the end i didn’t drop to my goal but i did get in the range. i was alr KINDA proud of myself hence i just accepted it. but because it was such a sudden loss of weight, i gained like half of the weight i lost back in the first few weeks of 2018. depressing. school was actually really helpful when it comes to distraction. i distracted myself with tons of schoolwork and studied a lot. yeaaah i mean at least i got good grades. this year, i was probably at my lightest during school terms. i was better during the holidays. i ate. but i always ended up gaining a bit of weight but i always lost all of that during the school term. so now it’s the end of year holidays for 2018 too. i ate a decent amount this hols, but i had a few relapses. like some days i’d just undereat. currently im not really at my desired weight, and i've set a new goal for myself - a bit more reasonable tho. OMG IF I CAN REACH THAT WEIGHT ID BE HAPPY AND OVER THE MOON AHHHHH ik this is fucking corrupted but i rlly still want to lose weight omgggg but some ppl telling me i too skinny or wtv shit but i don’t believe them like if u compare me w some other girls my age i’m like fucking fat ahhhhh

I met her a few months ago - we're both freshman in college - and we've had multiple conversations about her eating disorder. We're both a part of a friend group that eats lunch and dinner together, and she's said that encourages her to eat. She was in an eating disorder recovery clinic over the summer, and she has a nutritionist/therapist/doctor team, but she still counts calories.
A few days ago she revealed her doctor had told her that if she continues to eat the way she has been she'll be back in the hospital in two months. Month-long Winter Break is coming up and I'm concerned she'll have even greater difficulty with eating given she doesn't have a great home life and she won't have the regularity of shared college meals. Do you have any recommendations for how I can best support her? I'm out of state so I sadly won't be able to spend time with her irl, but I'll do whatever I can otherwise. I have NO intention of pressuring her to eat - I don't think that helps at all - but I just wonder if there are things I can do to remind her that eating isn't selfish or other ways to encourage her to get the calories she needs. I'm just worried about her and I don't want her to end up at the hospital again.

I either eat way too much or nothing at all.

My issue is I can feel my stomach growling. I know I’m hungry. Nothing sounds good. Often I’ll make myself a meal and it taste like nothing. Not bad, not good, nothing. I end up trashing half the food I buy.

I’m pretty sure it is problem that steams from some unconscious from my past: 1) if I was late to the dinner table I was to sit in the corner and wait “my turn” to eat. Since I “decided to be late” the “decided” when I ate. 2) if I did not like the meal or what to eat I would have the same plate sat in front of me for hours, if I didn’t eat that I then had that plate for breakfast the next day, lunch, etc.

I’m not sure how to motivate myself to eat. I fall into a cycle of it. I’m super hungry right now and can’t even bare to smell or look at food.

Advice on how to overcome this and eat? (Force feeding myself has not helped). Sometimes I end up eating pure crap fast food or drinking tons of water to ignore the issue.

625,a4pmqi,Request: Not Sure Whether I Have An ED Or Just Problems With My Body Image,"So, numerically, I'm just about at a healthy weight right now. I used to be obese but lost a bunch of weight in what I think was a healthy way through diet and exercise. The trouble is, even though I can see how far I've come, I still just look fat. I look ok with clothes on, but as soon as my shirt comes off and I see my body I'm just so frustrated and angry at myself. I've tried various calorie limits, I regularly lift weights, I plan my meals and try to eat well, but I feel as though I just look like any other fat guy who doesn't do these things.

I do restrict calories, but at what I think is a sensible number. I do also end up eating things I ""shouldn't"", in small bingeing episodes where I feel like nothing matters, but I wouldn't say it's excessive amounts of food or that I hide it. I get very upset if I have to miss a workout, and even on my rest days I feel gross if I don't do something active and have to at least go out for a walk. I never feel like I've done enough exercise, even when I'm exhausted. I keep up the exercise routine despite feeling like I'm not getting anywhere because I know I'll balloon up and look even worse if I stop working out.

Of course, any time I mention the fact that I have too much body fat, people quickly dismiss it and tell me I'm talking shit. Thing is, none of my friends are particularly athletic, and they probably just see me in clothes and think ""he looks fine"". It actually kind of hurts when they tell me I look ""ripped"" because I feel like they're invalidating what I'm saying and not listening to me, and not helping me become the best version of myself. I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to.

Does this sound like disordered behaviour? I know my relationship with food isn't great, but I was always sold the stereotypical narrative of ""eating disorder = skinny"".

I am a college student and am currently under the care of a psychiatrist, dietician/nutritionist, therapist, and nurse practitioner.

I am underweight and have been diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia, something I have struggled with since being a teenager. I have a long history of food-related trauma that caused me to develop an ed in the first place but I have been in recovery for awhile. Unfortunately, the stress of going to an elite school and ending an abusive relationship has triggered my disordered eating to flare up again.

But this time I don’t want to get better. I don’t want to eat and I want to keep losing weight. And this terrifies me because I know it’s wrong, I know I should eat, I know I should treat my body better, but I just... can’t. And I didn’t realize it had gotten this bad until I was put on a meal plan by my nutritionist and started balling because I didn’t want to eat that much.

I don’t know what to do and I’m afraid to mention it to anyone because I’m scared what will happen. I take prescription stimulants for ADHD which also help with binge-eating, but of course act as an appetite suppressant and I’m afraid they will take me off it which I desperately need to function.

I don’t want to be sick, I don’t want to be unhealthy, but my body image is so morphed that I feel like I can’t give up my ed.

I used to be overweight during high school, but due to some admittedly stringent calorie restriction during my first year of university managed to get myself at a relatively healthy weight.

I would try restricting calories again like I did in my first year, fail, severely berate myself for not being disciplined and then pick up more weight in the process, before losing it again in the next restriction cycle. Obsessively counting calories consumed, as well as burned during exercise was a normal daily preoccupation. I would also push myself for weeks to burn a certain amount of calories per exercise session, even if I was physically unfit to do so at the stage and would overexert myself in the process.

Now I feel it's coming to a head however. I'm sick and tired of cyclically gaining and losing weight that I've decided to drastically cut my calories over the next month to the point that feeling hungry means I'm on the right track.

632,a3yyza,Request: My Sister Has AN And It’s Destroying My Family. Help Me Understand.,"My sister has had AN for the past six or so years (at least diagnosed). She’s 27. She openly talks about dying young, skips meals, works out like crazy.

She’s been offered a ton of help, therapy, I’ve offered to pay for her living expenses so she doesn’t have to work and can recover, etc. She doesn’t. Says therapy doesn’t work and think she’s so fucking special that treatment works for others but not for her so she quits as soon as she starts. She’s an adult and she can do with her body as she wishes, I guess.

The thing is she lives with my parents who are getting older and this is killing them. I understand if she doesn’t want to recover but continuing to live with my parents is slowly killing them and we’re from a country where it’s usual for adult children to remain in the family home until married.

What’s my best approach? I wish I could help my sister but I’ve tried everything; sending her to psychiatrists, psychologists, nutritionists (most of my friends are doctors so I have a strong network of health professionals to refer her to), ED groups, offering to send her abroad to recover, etc. And she doesn’t accept it, even though she looks up to me a lot. Actually, last year when she fainted, she promised she’d try to slowly gain weight (w/ help of nutritionist and a therapist) while I focused on losing. I did lose some pounds and she probably lost at least a couple instead of gaining because she only went to a session or two. I think she likes to think of herself as a victim or enjoys the attention she gets. I’m obviously very angry at my sister because I see her self destructing the same as an alcoholic does; I understand it’s a disease but I also feel angry she’s not even trying to get help.

Right now my focus is my parents, specifically mom. Is there anything I can do for her? I see she’s in pain from seeing my sister like this and wish this time of her life now that she’s older she could be calm, happy and tranquil. She’s recently told me she’s started to go totherapy which is a great step but I’m Wondering if there’s anything else I could do for either one of them.

I struggled deeply from ages 11 to 24 when I got pregnant and finally got my life in order. Stopped restricting, stopped purging, stopped laxatives... stopped all of it. Gained a massive amount of weight but just kind of accepted that I would always be a fat and ugly woman but could still be a great mom so I didn’t really care...

Then slowly some small habits creeped back in. Mostly just thoughts at first and then just tracking what I was consuming and then I started purging but it was only once every 2 or 3 weeks... and that lasted for about the last 2 years.

But about a month and a half ago, I had something happen with a friend I’d turned to for support... and it really messed with my brain and my heart and it’s too painful to think of. Right afterwards, I just wasn’t hungry at all. I couldn’t stand the thought of eating so I didn’t eat anything at all for about a week.

Since then, I just haven’t been able to eat again without feeling overwhelmed and have been purging almost daily and just finding myself really struggling to make it through the day without checking my weight and freaking out about what I’m eating and what not... I’ve lost about 20 pounds since the incident that upset me. I think maybe that’s why my doctor thinks I am sick again but I just don’t know.

I’m still overweight and it’s only been a few weeks that I’ve been really struggling and I was fine before then. I recovered. I was fine. And I’m just so scared now. Somehow hearing my doctor say he thinks I have an eating disorder again has really just put me in panic mode and I don’t know what to do.

Half of me thinks if I go to the appointment from the referral they will just laugh at the ridiculousness of how fat I am and how mild my behaviours are compared with when I was actually sick... and half of me is terrified they won’t and that they’ll want me to eat a full meal plan and stop losing weight and I don’t know if I am okay with that.

TLDR: I was recovered for years but have recently been struggling and I don’t know if it’s really a relapse and needs treatment or if I’m actually fine and it will get better on its own.",1545265083,12/19/2018 18:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/a7sbb0/request_how_do_i_know_if_i_need_treatment_or_not/,3

635,a7la0h,Request: Can’t Stop Binging,"I am desperate to get into an eating routine that works for me and just focus on other things than food. I am a very busy person, and usually come home late- so whenever I come home for dinner, I usually end up binging, not because I don’t eat enough during the day, in fact I bring lots of food and meals with me when I go out so that I can avoid feeling super hungry and eating everything. Anyways, I just can’t escape this habit. I eat one thing after the other and feel so horrible about myself. It feels like once I start eating I can’t stop until I’m so so full. 

How do I stop this feeling? How do I eat until satiation and MOVE ON with my day? I try to tell myself I am full and I’ll eat something later, but can’t stop myself from eating more. I feel so guilty because I made brownies today and ate probably thousands of calories worth... I feel so ashamed.

636,a7ilg9,Request: Worried about high school friend,"Me and my friends are all seniors in high school and we’ve been really concerned for one of our friends in the past month or two. Shes always been a kind of quiet and reserved person, and has never really worn tight/formfitting clothes, so it took us a while to notice everything going on. However, once we put all the pieces together, it seems as though somethings wrong.

She hasnt been eating at lunch or when were all hanging out, which i noted but she usually doesnt have much of an appetite. Whenever we do see her eating, its spicy food (which ive heard is a sign of an ED but i really dont know). After one of our friend’s moms saying something to her, she admitted that shes lost 20 pounds in the past month or two. Shes was never overweight to start with, so thats a pretty significant amount. Shes also been having a lot of nightmares and fainted three times (that we know of) both of which arent good signs.

I talked to my mom, who called her mom and said she wasnt eating at lunch and we were worried, but her mom apparently knows she hasnt been eating and that shes been trying to lose weight. Is there anything else we can do to help her ? We all love her and are very concerned, especially considering we wont be around next year (were all going to different colleges).",1545190110,12/18/2018 21:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/a7ilg9/request_worried_about_high_school_friend/,8
637,a7fy4v,Request: How Can I Help My Sister Who I Heard Purging Last Night?,"Last night my sister (my roommate, 27F) was in the bathroom in the shower or at least having the shower on and I heard her throwing up repeatedly and flushing the toilet. When I went out to the kitchen I saw from the dishes that she had eaten cinnamon buns and cookies. Around that time I had been listening to an audiobook and tidying up etc. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't just barge into the bathroom so I just pretended I was still listening to my headphones and was unaware. A few minutes after she got out she was like ""I think the cinnamon buns are going stale, do you mind if I throw them out?"" I played it off and said to go ahead.

What should I do? Looking for advice from someone that has been in her situation before. Will it hurt her to talk about it? Should I text her rather than talk so that it's easier for her to react to? I was thinking of texting something like ""is there anything I can do to help you in situations like last night?""

She only revealed that she has relapsed back to binging and purging (after struggling off and on with it for years) a few days ago. I asked if there was any way I could help her and she just said not to tell our parents (im 25F, we visit them every other weekend or so). Vast history of severe mental illness and body dysmorphia that is too long of a story for here. Her psychiatrist doesn't know that she is struggling with this and is pushing to terminate their sessions because he thinks she is doing fine.

We're both young women in our mid-20s. We work full-time at a relatively low-stress office where everyone eats at their desks. Over the past few months, I've noticed that she's eating less and less throughout the day. She used to pack lunch, but completely stopped a few weeks ago. She does eat very healthy snacks like cashews and carrot sticks, but she never eats more than a handful of each- not enough to sustain someone from 9-5:30. Today, she ate a handful of grapes. She drinks a lot of coffee and says she drinks a glass of wine pretty much every night. She expresses disgust at the thought of eating any moderately unhealthy foods, and literally always refuses when people bring in snacks or baked goods or even free dinner at work events. She even comes with me sometimes when I pick up lunch, but never gets anything.

She has often casually mentioned that she ""forgot"" to eat lunch due to feeling stressed. Still, she never ate much and the last 2-3 weeks it's really almost nothing. She looks very pale and tired, exactly like a friend of mine with a serious eating disorder. I know for a fact that I'm the only one who notices this at work and she doesn't have any roommates or family in the city. I feel like I should say something because we're friends (talk about personal stuff, text, hang out occasionally outside work, etc.) and because I'm pretty sure that no one else is aware of this.

Does this seem like an eating disorder? Is there anything I can do to support her? How can I handle this so that I don't make her feel ""monitored"" at work?

She had made massive improvements from last year where although i don't know her exact weight she was quite visibly severely underweight. Currently she still has quite a few troubling thoughts on her weight and how people see her and i feel like this is halting and severity affecting her recovery.

Since i dont live with her and don't meet her exact. I recently started to try to get her to eat 3 meals a day although she has not always done so. As a result I have been asking her if she has eaten around the time of when people usually eat their meals. She said it was helpful but i am really not sure and would like some of your inputs.

Also i am trying to get her to tell me everything she feels so that i can better help and understand her. The problem is that i have never faced such an adversity and really cannot relate. I do understand that this is not her fault and that recovery will not be instant and am willing to just be by her side and support her whenever she needs it. And i want her to know that i will always be by her side whenever she needs help

655,a9t9uf,Request: IVF with history of Eating Disorder,"I’ve (36F) been struggling with my weight for the better half of the past decade. I was always skinny as a teen and young adult, doing numerous sports such as competitive horse riding and martial arts, but as I approached my thirties I had to consciously work towards maintaining my weight.

The pounds kept piling on and peaked at age 29 when I reached a weight that was close to being considered overweight. This was a shock, but at around that time I broke up with my then fiancé which sent me into a depression spiral. I had no appetite to eat because I was sad, and my weight plummeted to borderline underweight, but still within healthy standards. As an unfortunate result, I then knew that I could just not eat and my weight could be controlled easily. I also started smoking, and most of my days were just chain smoking and drinking coffees. No food.

Eventually, I started passing out at age 33, which was also a result of massive amounts of stress in my life. Got down to a really low weight and that’s when my new fiancé and friends tried intervening to get me to take up healthier habits. For a long time, I heavily resisted them and denied there was any problem. I insisted to them that I ate well, while going through great lengths to secretly throw away food or just eat as little as possible. I canceled dinner plans and stayed home, left my workplace on lunch hours to walk around aimlessly so nobody would see I wasn't actually having lunch, and lied to pretty much everyone. Went into therapy where I admitted that I had an eating disorder for the first time. Therapy did not help, except to identify that my eating disorder had to do with low self esteem and a desire for control within pretty chaotic and stressful life circumstances.

Eventually, fiancé and I got married and started trying for a baby. It soon became clear that we’d have to undergo IVF, as hubby’s sperm count was almost non existent. That was the turning point. I quit smoking in March this year, went to a nutritionist, ate three meals a day, started going to the gym, quit coffee and started preparing for putting someone else’s needs above my own. The hormone treatment was grueling, and especially since quitting smoking, the weight kept creeping back despite me following a hypocaloric diet and exercising regularly. My clothes all stopped fitting so it wasn’t just muscle weight. At the time, I could handle it because it felt that this would all pay off. But since going through a miscarriage three weeks ago and finding myself at my heaviest this morning, with a body that’s battered and bruised from almost two months of hormone shots, there’s an almost overwhelming urge to stop eating again because it feels like nothing is working and there's nothing to stay healthy for. I feel unattractive and hopeless.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I would appreciate any advice from people who have gone through something similar, especially regarding IVF. I really don’t want to stop eating but it feels like I’m going to shut down and restrict my food intake again. Please keep in mind this is not something I can easily control. It just feels like everything failed, the therapist, the nutritionist, the trainer at the gym, everything.

So, I’m a figure skater and have been for the last 6 years. I started when I was 12 (18 now) and I love this sport and wanted to get stronger and lighter to help my jumps.

When I was 14, I was diagnosed with PCOS and encouraged to lose weight to help with the disorder. My mom put me on a diet where I was forced to cut out most of the food groups, like sweets, dairy, carbs, and a couple other arbitary things like caffeine, gluten, and soy. I was also encouraged to go on keytones to help me lose weight further. All this was forced on me despite several attempts to tell her I didn’t want this, but eventually after a bit I stopped fighting, barely eating my food because it was all gross and I didn’t want it. I dropped a good amount of weight before going ‘fuck it’ and sneaking food at school and whatnot, regaining to my original weight.

Now, I’m 18 and currently inbetween my original weight and my lowest weight as of this morning. I’ve been barely eating much over the last year or so and since August I’ve been averaging a very low calorie diet. I’m still figure skating and having lost the weight has made my jumps easier to land. I’m still heavily struggling with the disordered eating/ED (I’m still not sure which I have) and my body image since I’ve always just felt insecure about my appearance on the ice, and I want to recover, but I’m concerned about my dresses no longer fitting me and about losing my jumps due to the extra weight, since that happened when I gained weight before.

657,a9t8ce,Request: My Thoughts On The Morning Following Christmas Dinner,"It’s the morning after my family’s christmas dinner. I ate a lot, and as much as I wish I could’ve eaten a smaller amount of food, and ate only until fullness- I didn’t. I was looking around for posts about overeating on Holidays so I could feel less alone and there aren’t too too many. Last night, I felt slightly crazy going back for more and more bites of cake on top of having way too many cookies, whilst everybody else just had one piece. I felt guilty and thought people were probably judging me. Holidays are scary- You have the appetizers, the main, the bread and cheese, the dessert, the drinks. It’s terribly hard not to overeat. It’s like I can’t tell if this was a binge or not. But despite last night- I will still eat breakfast and continue my day as normal. I don’t feel too guilty and even though I ate more food than I can even remember, I didn’t feel sick and uncomfortably after my meal which is a success in my eyes. I’ve got ANOTHER family get together tonight, I will try to focus more on being with my family rather than the food. I’m starting to realize that overeating on holidays is pretty normal- one or a few days of doing it will not wreck me or make me spiral. Next time I will try to do better but I have to stop beating myself up. Also I found that is has helped me to think about old times and realize that I don’t remember what I ate. Even though I put so much importance to what I consume on a given day, it slips my mind and I only remember the interactions, the people, what I did... I don’t know. I also like to tell myself that I have eaten this much before, maybe more and I was FINE. 

I will be okay. You will be okay.

658,a9nucx,Rrquest: Extreme Initial Weight Gain,"I am just starting to recover from my most recent Anorexia relapse. I lost several pounds in a short time and got down to a weight that my dietitian last Monday described as ""severe malnutrition"". He also mentioned sarcopenia, bone mineral depletion and all that stuff.

So, right on Monday I decided to start eating more, also because it was Christmas' Eve and then also Christmas, which I both spent with my family.

And eat more I did. I really eat a lot. But I mean, A LOT. Not just a ""normal"" lot. I mean a very big ""a lot"". I just ate what I wanted.

I also ate a lot today. After my very large breakfast I weighed myself. I was expecting some weight gain of course, but I was shocked to see that my scale went up 13 lbs. from Monday. And it's only been two days of eating what I want! I know some of it is water weight, but it still frightens me. Even accounting for all the food I ate the ""actual"" weight gain should only be a tiny fraction of that value. Will this newly gained weight shed off? I don't want to gain all my weight back in a week. I want it to be a long, slow process in order to get better used to it and be able to deal with it. Gaining all my weight back in such a short time would completely mess up with my head and send me straight back into a harder relapse, only that this time there would be no Christmas to come to the rescue.

Any advice?",1545823568,12/26/2018 5:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/a9nucx/rrquest_extreme_initial_weight_gain/,13
659,a9e3d7,Request: How To Handle A Relapse?,"Hi I’ll try to make this quick. I’ve been fully recovered from anorexia for a long time. it was really awful last time but I had a big and amazing support system. now my life is entirely different and I don’t have that support anymore. I can feel myself relapsing and it’s terrifying. my thoughts are racing and it gave me a panic attack tonight. I really thought this was behind me...

if you’d like more details, I used to live in another state. had a longterm relationship where my boyfriend had a sister with anorexia so he saw this first hand and entirely understood it. my best friend suffered herself so we could vent to each other and we understood each other. I was also on psychiatric medication and in therapy with the most amazing therapist you could imagine.

fast forward to now, I moved, have a boyfriend who doesn’t understand what the fuck I’m talking about. I tried to explain things to him tonight and he honestly just made it worse with some of the things he said. I quit my meds cold turkey a while ago. I’m past the withdrawals. I’m not in therapy because I moved and have no insurance here yet. my friend moved as well and we barely talk. I have no support system. I feel alone and scared because I almost died last time and that was with a bunch of people surrounding me who helped so much. now I feel like I’m relapsing alone.

I’m also scared because I know a relationship can’t possibly sustain in this situation. so I was thinking I’d have to move back home to recover.

I just want to prevent this from spiraling out of control but I can already feel the control slipping away.

661,a94848,Request: Cellulite After Being Semi Recovered,"Quick history: developed an ED five years ago but not your typical anorexia / orthorexia etc. I just eat three large healthy meals a day with with a healthy desert post lunch and dark chocolate post dinner. I have been eating like this for a long time and I feel great when it’s done right. The disordered characteristics are: - when I feel full and uncomfortable I will mentally beat myself up until the next meal. I will always eat the next meal even when I am full because I am scared the food will run out - I am so scared to arrive late to reservations because I am scared of not having my food on time - extreme fear of having dairy in anything that I eat unless it’s a controlled dose of 0% greek yoghurt in the morning only - extreme fear of anything unhealthy and not wholesome - avoiding refined sugars, refined carbs anything fried, oily, creamy, heavy etc. - if I don’t eat at a particular time in the day I panic - if I go two to three days without exercise I panic - I obsess over my body shape and will scrutinise myself for hours in front of the mirror, stretching touching pinching hitting and taking pictures of myself - I become severely depressed and anxious when I see skinny women around me who seem normal. I obsess over them and want to know how and what they eat. - I am muscly but thin and I hate the size of my hamstrings and quads. I wish I had model legs. - I eat very regularly and maybe more than all my female friends. My portions are significantly larger, which obviously makes me criticise myself and make me believe that I’m doing it all wrong. But I can’t seem to change the way I eat. I know my body so well that if I feel I under-ate even by a single sweet potato or piece of broccoli, I will panic and won’t be settled or calm until I have it. ETC.

I was at my lowest weight last year and decided to see professionals. My dietician never gave me a meal plan because I ate already very well. She just made me more relaxed regarding what I ate. So by slightly increasing my intake I gained 5kg in a year. I am now at a borderline healthy BMI. However although I exercise very regularly (4/5times a week) and I’m extremely fit, I developed cellulite around the glute hamstring tie-in, and also what seems to look like mini saddlebags. I loathe the cellulite and don’t understand why I have it. I never had a problem with cellulite up until now. Maybe my glutes are lazy and aren’t activating when I exercise. I started running, switched up my training, seeing a PT, doing Pilates and different boutique fitness classes etc. I don’t know what more I can do. I don’t know why the cellulite appeared and why my butt is the only area of my body that’s not tight, like my legs. I’m at loss and so desperate for an answer. It’s agonising and I can no longer go about my day to day because I’m obsessing over this issue. I have so much more to live for and so much that’s waiting for me on the other side, but I can’t seem to leave the hole I’m stuck in. I just want a scientific concrete and rational answer as to why I have developed the worst cellulite ever when I gained the weight despite eating very healthily, exercising regularly, and having low body fat and a borderline healthy BMI.

Does anyone with this diagnoses have any advice? I am still not in recovery following this diagnosis, though my portion sizes are smaller. I have gained a significant amount of weight after a period where I became obsessive about exercise and dieting. I am very unhappy at my current weight but can’t see a way out of it because I have a fear of exercise because of how I have been shown it in the past, and I constantly struggle with binge cycles. I have allowed myself this last semester at college to practically eat whatever I wanted, rationalising that it was ok because I was doing so much better in school. I have a therapist who specialises in eating disorders and is a nutritionist, but I don’t keep up with her enough, and I’ve stopped logging my food on recovery record.

How do I motivate myself to make change? I even made myself go to the body worlds exhibition in London to try and convince myself of the harm I am doing to my body. Nothing seems to convince me in that moment where I “reward” myself that I shouldn’t act on impulse. Does anyone have any advice? I’d love to get in touch with an online sponsor, I haven’t had success with the twelve step program as an atheist and have not been able to reconcile as to what my higher power is.

665,a8twm6,Request: Do I have an eating disorder?,"I am an 18-year old born-female and I am currently quite thin/underweight. I’ve never seen my low weight as a big deal, as I’ve always been either underweight or a healthy weight. I’ve never considered myself to be conscious about what I eat, and I’ve been told in the past that I just have a high metabolism.

I have noticed that since starting college I have lost a few pounds. I do have a regular eating schedule in that I eat brunch and dinner, and sometimes a snack (usually pretzels) in the afternoon. I only eat when I’m hungry, which is usually around those times. I don’t oversleep either, which I’ve been asked about a few times.

I’ve been told that weighing what I do at my current age and height puts me at a very low bmi, and that I should try to put on some weight. I am against gaining weight, but I’m not trying to lose weight either. I don’t count my calories, and the only time I see my weight on a scale is at my appointments with my psychiatrist.

I’ve always waved away suggestions that I might have an eating disorder simply because I’ve never considered it a problem, and it hasn’t caused me any issues that I know of. I don’t starve myself, but I’m not sure if there’s such a thing as “low hunger drive” either. I just eat until I’m not hungry, and I don’t stick to exclusively healthy foods (actually my diet is quite poor, heh.)

I’m not sure if I’m feeling effects that I’m not recognizing. I have some problems due to a heart condition, but there hasn’t been anything new along with my losing a few pounds these last few months. Food simply doesn’t appear appetizing when I’m not hungry, and sometimes thinking about eating until I’m full makes my stomach turn. Did/does anyone have these subtle signs, or weren’t aware they had an eating disorder? Do I have some other issue, like not being hungry when I should be? I know that I am a small person, but between the comments my psychiatrist make (my medication did not make me lose weight), and bmi calculators, I’m starting to think there might be an issue, or that there could be an issue down the line.

666,a8tvnf,Request: need help with my sister who has Ed," Hope someone will take the time to read My whole family is torn apart over my sister. She’s 24 and starting odd eating habits in high school but they got better up until about 3 years ago when our dad committed suicide. Ever since then her ED has gotten pretty bad. She never eats a meal or even close to a meal. She will cut an apple into slices and eat one slice and put the rest in the fridge. We caught her chewing chicken and spitting it in the trash without swallowing it. We don’t know if she purges but really hope she doesn’t.

Despite all of this, she still will not openly say she has an ED. It has torn my family apart over the years. We used to fight about her not eating a lot until we learned that is terrible and not helpful to her so we try to let her be and just encourage her to get help.

Now that we don’t fight about the actual ED as much...she will find ANYTHING to fight about with my mom, mainly. She will find ANY little thing to pick a fight over (such as “why did you say that in a shitty way”) she will fight and scream to my mom for hours sometimes before usually slamming the door and going to her boyfriends apartment. Her BF insists to us that she doesn’t have a problem despite obvious signs such as her spitting chicken into the trash and he enables her.

Now after starting another huge fight with my mom over relatively NOTHING....she has went to her Bfs and changed her phone number and said she is not coming home for Christmas.

My mom is already stressed all the time from her husband killing himself and now she has to deal with this. It tears our whole family apart and our Christmas will be ruined now. I don’t know how to deal with it. Every time she’s home at my moms house she will turn something so little into a HUGE fight even if it was nothing to do with ED. it makes us all sick to our stomachs and worried to death about her when she’s away at school.

668,a8hr0h,"Request: Can't Have An Eating Disorder, Missing Most Of The Key Criteria?","I don't know where else to ask, I have no idea who to talk to.

Brief backstory. I've never been super fixated on my weight. Never even really thought about it too much. I've always deeply loathed my appearence and body, but it had nothing to do with weight (the problem is my bone structure, which is unchangable lol), and I never once thought that being skinnier would make me look ""better"" or improve my self-esteem or anything. On top of that, until recently, my general relationship with food and eating was ""if I'm craving it I'll have it"", no second thoughts. I just ate whatever, never thought much about it.

But. I deal with a lot of trauma and mental health issues, and have struggled with extreme self-destructive impulses almost all my life. For the past half-decade or so, I would occasionally forcibly starve myself for a short period of time, as a result of these self-destructive impulses. That was the end of it, though, it never lasted long, and it was never bad or anything. Nothing about my thinking surrounding food or my weight or anything changed, I never developed any of the key characteristics of anorexia or anything. It was just me being self-destructive and stupid.

But something has changed recently. Sort of. I started one of my self-harming-through-forced-starvation episodes at the beginning of October. I was extremely stressed and tight on money during this time, and I was doing much 'better' at restricting my food intake than I ever had been before, so I was saving quite a bit of money. I was like, ""hey, wow, I need that money..... I was wasting so much before. I should keep going a little longer with this.""

And so I kept going. I felt that just like every time before, I'd just ""snap out of it"" whenever, not much had changed, it was no big deal. So I kept going. And I started to feel this weird...... ok, I don't wanna sound completely nuts, but I promise I'm being serious. I dunno, I started to feel almost....... ""high"", when I got to a certain point of going without food. I felt weirdly ""Good"", like I had a buzzing sensation under my skin. So....... I was like, ""this clearly isn't That bad, I'm not doing any real harm, I'll just stop whenever I feel like it.""

But I didn't end up feeling like it. Without realizing it at first, the amount i was eating, and the amount I considered ""a lot"" or ""a little"" food, slowly started to shift downwards. Things I'd considered practically nothing before felt like huge meals, the idea of eating them and feeling them in my stomach made me anxious, I'd go to eat what I used to consider ""small"" snacks and ask myself, ""why?"", and I wouldn't want to eat it. Why should I? I felt ill and anxious being ""full"", I felt weirdly buzzed and ""high"" and...... ""better"" being Empty, and I could stop anytime......... so I didn't.

And now I. don't want to eat. I don't want to eat At All. I make myself eat somewhat, at least every few days, because I feel like I Know I ""should"", but..... I don't know. I hate it. It feels strange to say that, y'know, how can I ""hate"" eating, how can being empty make me feel ""good"" or ""better"" in some way? But I dunno, it just does. I keep repeating to myself that obviously I'm going to stop in the future, I'll stop if I ever get sick, I'll stop whenever, and I..... still think that I could, if I wanted to........ but I don't. Want to. Stop, I mean.

BUT. It doesn't feel like a ""problem"". Because I can't have an eating disorder, right?? I'm MISSING most of the main symptoms, right? I'm 1) Not terrified of weight gain 2) Not fixated on my weight or have any real desire to lose weight/become skinnier 3) Not afraid of eating in front of others (in fact, I eat almost exclusively in front of others, so they don't worry) 4) Not chasing some sort of ""ideal"" or think that losing weight will help me appearance wise in any way 5) Don't think food is ""bad"" or that being ""fat"" is bad or scary or unattractive 6) Do not have an extreme desire for 'control' over myself or something

and I'm sure there's more I'm not thinking of. I'm unable to relate to almost anyone I meet who has/had an eating disorder. I'll...... concede that this......... fixation has recently taken my mind somewhat off of my trauma and pain, but I didn't go into it with that in mind, and I don't......... FEEL like that's why I'm still doing it. I think. I don't know.

I just want to be empty. I just don't want to eat anymore. But I'm still able to make myself eat, I'm still functioning fine, and I'm missing the symptoms about weight fixation and such, so I feel like there's no way I'm sick. I can't be sick. That's how I feel, anyway.

What are your thoughts?? Is there anyone who's experienced something similar......? Any feedback is welcome.

(oh, also, if it's of any note: a) I'm a guy, b) my mom almost certainly had anorexia, which I've been told puts me at higher risk for an eating disorder, but her's was about weight and thinking she was fat, so....... and c) I also feel like this is nothing and can't be serious because it's only been about 3 months. That feels..... so short. Like I can't possibly have a problem after only a few months, I guess? I dunno.)",1545452201,12/21/2018 22:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/a8hr0h/request_cant_have_an_eating_disorder_missing_most/,7
669,a8gu4f,"Request: I Suspect I Have An Eating Disorder - Feeling Ashamed And In Denial, Maybe.","Hi,

Today I had an appointment with my GP and we got on to the topic of my diet. I expressed that it wasn't very healthy and as she pried further I mentioned that I don't like to think so but it sometimes veers into binge eating territory and that I comfort eat a lot. I didn't really expect much to come from this, but she gave me some resources for it and told me it was something we should tackle in the future, as the appointment was specifically for anxiety and chest pain. One of these resources was an eating disorder self help booklet; whilst I knew I had issues with food, all of the symptoms applied to me. I feel afraid to google anything else about it in case I confirm what I possibly already know deep down.

I have always overeaten. Food is comfort to me and when I eat with people, I bond with people. After gaining around a lot of weight I healthily dieted - a few months later I promptly put it all and more back on. A few weeks ago a different (still healthy) diet - which seemed to be a success - but now I am at the point where I feel no self control around food again. I eat to the point of discomfort and will even eat after that if I can. Sometimes I feel guilty after overeating and rarely, I will eat extra in secret. Some people say no to food because they're not hungry and this is preposterous to me - if it's nice, why not? I just eat and eat.

However, might my behaviour be normal? Everywhere, you see love of food. Love of junk food. People that eat a lot. Girls, for example, who brag about eating whole pizzas. Writing this, I realise I have no other examples and that most people do not over indulge constantly. Despite this, it seems to be the norm as obesity is on the rise. So, is what I do 'normal'?

Anyhow, the thought that I might have Binge Eating Disorder fills me with shame and embarrassment. I know it shouldn't. I think I am denial and even the fact that I can acknowledge that makes me feel bad. I am a healthy weight, I don't look like I have an eating disorder and there seems to be a stigma around any ED that isn't anorexia or bulimia. The thought of having to say I might have BED fills me with dread - I don't think it would be taken seriously.

I'm not really sure what else to write. I don't want to pick the self help book back up at this moment in time. I'm not really even sure what advice I'm looking for. Sorry for the convolution, I usually have a good grasp on how I feel and how to deal with it but this isn't something I'm familiar with. I'm not sure what to do next.

Thanks!

670,a8diu3,"Request: I Have A Close Friend Struggling With An ED, And I Don’t Know How To Help","I (20F) met my ex-girlfriend and close friend (20F) in September 2016. We started dating in Feb 2017, and then she told me about her eating disorder around April. She got really drunk and confessed to me, and I learned that she would go out at night on our campus to purge in random bathrooms. I was the only person who knew. Eventually, she told her close friends, but none of them talk with her about it.

Fast forward to the past few months. She broke up with me in September, citing reasons that were about me, some things about her, etc. After a few months of no contact, we meet up again and she tells me that she’s going to campus at night again. I know that means she’s hiding her ED from the people she lives with. I get especially worried because she doesn’t live on campus, so going there at night means traveling through a dangerous part of the city.

More recently, she confided in me that the main reason she broke up with me is because of her ED, and not the other stuff she cited. She got a lot better over the summer (even started seeing a therapist — not someone who specializes in ED stuff though), but she’s spiraled the past few months, especially without me in her life. She told me that the reason she would flake on plans is because she had scheduled purging sessions, and other things like that. She stopped working out, has a terrible sleep schedule, and is basically falling into old patterns. She’s had this ED since sophomore year of HS, and a doctor even recommended that she go to a treatment clinic, but her family has not been helpful at all. Her morher refuses to believe she has an ED, comments on her weight, how much she eats, etc.

She basically told me that she chose her ED over me. That she’s in a relationship with both. She doesn’t want to “use” me as a reason to get better, but she is too depressed/hates herself, so she won’t do it for herself.

She is adamant about not getting professional help. She is the type of person who thinks that something like this is only the responsibility of the person who has it. I don’t know if she talks to her therapist about her ED. She claims that she can stop purging if she just restricts her food intake, and I’m not arguing with her because I don’t want to put off any of her recovery thoughts. I know she wants to get better. I know she regrets her ED controlling our relationship. I love her a lot, but I don’t know what the right course of action is. Should I try to get help for her?

I’ve tried to look up information on this, but I can’t tell if it’s possible to have an eating disorder without body image issues. I’ve been underweight my entire life. I’m very skinny and don’t LOVE the way I look, but it’s not anything I really care about changing. Lately (within the last few months) I’ve been having trouble with food. I’ve been EXTREMELY picky, almost never have an appetite, and my portions are very small (I’m currently struggling to 11 chicken nuggets because I feel so full). I feel hungry most of the time, but I usually just don’t care about eating. Like the hunger isn’t enough motivation for me to actually eat. I’ll usually only eat if I start to feel sick. Question is, is this even a kind of eating disorder? Or do you HAVE to have body image issues for it to be classified as such?",1546399432,1/1/2019 21:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/abpbz4/request_eating_disorder_without_body_image_issues/,5

674,abnbzl,Request: Seeking advice on recovery and relapse," 

I have been recovering from ana over the past years after struggling  with it since middle school. I had a few relapses early on but I’ve been  doing better with recovery ever since I started working on muscle  toning. 

I was with my boyfriend’s family just before Christmas to celebrate  and I didn’t eat the entire day.  I’ve known them for a long time, so it  wasn’t an issue of nervousness. Whenever I got close to food, I felt  repulsed. I didn’t want to be. At my own house on Christmas, I ate a normal amount but felt extremely guilty  afterward. Due to a busy end of my semester, I didn’t have as much time  for the gym. I’m not so happy about my body right now, so the irrational  part of my brain wants me to starve and/or purge.

Any advice from recoverers on what to do when you feel the urge to  relapse? I’m really proud of my progress, and I don’t want to lose it.",1546385493,1/1/2019 17:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/abnbzl/request_seeking_advice_on_recovery_and_relapse/,1
675,abnbk5,Request: please help me understand/be there for my GF," 

Hi, first off thanks for reading and please excuse any terrible  grammar or structure. I'm writing this on my phone, in the middle of a  New Year's party, and my thoughts are everywhere. 

My GF has an ED. We've been a thing for about 2 months now, just  started really opening up to each other, but I've known that she has  weird dietary habits before being with her. I love her with all my heart  and soul, and it kills me hearing her talk about stuff I don't  understand/can't help with. I, myself, have depression, anxiety, and  bipolar disorder. I know how it feels to talk to someone and have them  not understand. It's already awkward enough between her and I as she's  the first person I trust and love, this is all very new to me. She also  lives in another city, which makes it all harder knowing that I can't  physically be there for her when she needs someone to hug. It fucking  tears me apart and I know how it feels. 

What's hurting me the most is that I don't know what to tell her.  I've never had friends/knew anyone who suffered from an eating disorder.  Like for example, she goes for like a couple days without eating  anything, just water. I know this is wrong, but I can't tell her to just  eat, it feels like my parents not understanding depression telling me  to ""just smile and think positive thoughts"". I hate it. 

A running gag between us to ask each other about what we're  eating/planning to eat. She's skinny, not super duper skinny, just  skinny. She says that she's gonna ""eat a lot today"" which usually ends  up being a hundred something calories. Most of the time she ends up not  eating that due to any reason, food seems to be a secondary thought of  hers. If she's stressed about something, thinking about something, or  just doing anything really, she doesn't eat. 

Her habits include going on a mono diet, fasting, eating tiny bits of food, and some I can't remember rn. 

We talked a bit about what she thinks might be causing these odd  dietary habits. She said ""self loathing, self hate, wanting to die, and  proving my dad wrong for something he said to be 12 years ago"" She also  added ""this is a great way to get this feeling without killing myself.  Gotta graduate college before that. It'll make mom less sad""

She has family issues. Her dad is an abusive cunt, but thankfully  he's not in the picture anymore. Sometime around the age of 12 or 11 she  found a forum that had a lot of girls who had various kinds of EDs. She  befriended some and started doing what they did. She just ""felt good""  after each destructive thing she did. She felt like ""she's in control"".  She can't go to a therapist, her mom thinks it's a ""trendy diet thing""  although her daughter is clearly not ok. She hides her sad thoughts and  disorder from her family because it will cause more problems and make  her mom worry.

676,abnay1,REQUEST: ADHD And Eating Disorder," 

So I’m 21 years old and been working this year to recover from my eating disorder. Ive been diagnosed with a binge eating disorder characterized by cycles of restriction and bingeing. I’ve been very successful in recovery so far working on eating more protein (most of us with BED are severely protein deficient) and learning that I’m insulin resistant which has been one of the the caused of my insatiable appetite. Unfortunately this month I hit a wall in recovery. I was just diagnosed with ADD and prescribed vyvanse which has been life changing in terms of what it has done for my focus, motivation, etc. One of the side effects of vyvanse is a suppressed appetite. I think my doctor assumed the suppressed appetite would be a good thing for someone with BED because it would decrease the likelihood of binges. Unfortunately the decrease in appetite has given strength to my eating disorder voice. The biggest problem is that I can’t convince myself to eat when I don’t have an appetite. And as most of us with BED know; when we restrict, we binge, and when we binge we restrict. I’m scared that all the work I’ve been doing this year to eat more regularly and give my body the nutrition it needs is flying out the window. BUT I don’t want to go off ADD medication. It has been incredibly life changing and has made me feel more like myself then I have in years. So: Has anyone else had this experience? Are there ADD medications that are safer for my eating disorder? Any tips for people with both of these diagnoses? Any tricks to eating while on vyvanse or eating without an appetite? Thank you so much for reading this and for any advice you can give!",1546385301,1/1/2019 17:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/abnay1/request_adhd_and_eating_disorder/,5
677,ab9l3b,Academic Research Study: Cognitive processes involved in Eating Behaviours," 

Dissertation title: Cognitive processes involved in Eating Behaviours 

&amp;#x200B;

Abstract:

Research suggests that multiple cognitive and behavioural processes are involved in how we think, feel, and behave around food. The purpose of this study is to identify how these processes influence eating behaviours, and to determine why this results in disordered eating for some but not others.

You will be asked to answer some short demographic questions, followed by several questionnaires on yourself, and how you think, feel, and behave in certain situations and environments.

These questions involve standardised tests which are routinely used to screen for certain psychological disorders. Scores from these tests would not be sufficient basis for clinical decisions or diagnosis, and are not being used for diagnostic purposes in this study. Due to the nature of this study, some questions may seem very personal and at times can cause mild discomfort. They are designed to identify different patterns of behaviours and thoughts, and are not unnecessarily intrusive. Support contacts will be provided in the debrief at the end of the study.

678,ab8pse,Request: Eating is hard," 

Hi. I'm 23, male and been skinny my whole life. I'm underweight but not extremely and I'm completely healthy. I never had any food related illnesses or weight problems - actually never had any health issues except a depressive episode when I was about 18.

I work in an office, I eat healthy, I sleep normally, I never drink, I only occasionally smoke weed, I drink mostly water and nothing else most of the time, and for the past few months I've been going to the gym and working out for the first time in years and actually gained a bit of weight because I'm eating a bit more.

Since I can remember I eat three meals a day (cooked, healthy, I'm still living with my parents) and since I'm pretty self-conscious about my skinny appearance and I've always wanted to be bulkier I rarely skip them and I always try to eat until I'm really full.

HOWEVER - I don't enjoy food. I would say about one in six or seven meals I actually enjoy eating and all other meals are basically just a chore that I know I need to do just to stay alive and feel ok and keep my weight. Most of the time I have 0 appetite and the thought of eating just annoys me and I know that I'll need to spend like 20 minutes or more just doing this thing that is not enjoyable in any way and just uncomfortable and hard.

It's been like this for the last 10 years, maybe even more. Depending on what food I have it also affects how much or how little I enjoy it - or which makes it less hard to eat. Also, my psychological state also affects my eating greatly. If I'm nervous, sad, depressed, tired, anxious, excited or anything like that - I also lose all appetite. If I'm really happy, or in love, or had sex, or had a good night, or (only sometimes) if I smoked weed, then I can actually come in a state where I feel hungry and really want to eat. I cherish these moments because they are really rare for me and whenever they do happen I feel so blessed and I'm imagining what a nicer life it would be if this was normal.

Because food is for 90% of the time something that feels 'foreign' to me and my body (don't know how to explain it better) I really easily get sick/nauseous (not to the point of throwing up, but just kinda sick and unwell) if I'm eating outside my comfort zone, and foods I'm not used to. Because of this I'm really uncomfortable eating around people I don't know or people I like and people in general. I always avoid that it if I can. It also takes quite some time for me to get comfortable eating with the person I'm in a relationship. I pretty much never eat with my friends if I really don't have to. Even my best and closest friend of many years.

I'm pretty sensitive to everything I can ingest, that's one of the reasons I don't drink. Weed, too, can easily make me nauseous and being excited or nervous can also do that very easily, also working out or basically doing whatever is strange to my body or mind. I'm not a child, but my body does react the same way since I was one, haha. I'm not sick and nauseous all the time, but I really do think it's much, much, more frequent than in other people.

This affects my life greatly and every single day and I want to change it. My plans change because of it, I need to plan when I'm going to eat if I'm going out or whatever, and I am also extra uncomfortable if I need to leave somewhere for a whole day or a few days. I don't want to think about it 3 times a day, and also in between.

So, that's my story. I've never sought any help, I'm not even sure if this is the right place to post this, I never really worked on it and I do understand that something, somewhere, psychologically is off and that's probably the cause of all this but I really can't find or understand what the fuck is it. I am planning to see a doctor or do something about it, but I thought maybe I could get some insight or help here from you guys.

What should I do?

Thank you to however read this, it's actually been nice to write it all down and I wish you all a great and happy new year.",1546274450,12/31/2018 10:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ab8pse/request_eating_is_hard/,3

680,ab8j5h,Request: New years resolutions making me anxious," 

As the year winds down,  I’m finding myself growing more and more anxious about New Year’s  resolutions and all of the fad diets and challenges that people engage  in when January hits. Even things not necessarily related to eating,  like Dry January, are really spiking me. I have so many friends doing  it, food/fitness challenges, etc starting 1/1 and it’s making me feel  like I’m an unhealthy person, an alcoholic, etc. just because I don’t  feel the need to give anything up? 

I am at such a great place with fitness and food, and I feel great in  my skin. I’ve just been feeling guilty and anxious lately because all  ANYONE talks about these days is how they need to “work off” the holiday  weight once 2019 starts.

Rationally, I know that as someone who is not even a year into her  recovery, I should NOT be participating in any challenge that forces me  to completely give something up for one month...so this shouldn’t upset  me so much. But I legitimately feel guilty now knowing that I’m going to  continue drinking or eating things that many people give up. I’m going  to feel crappy if (because I know it’ll happen) I post a picture of  myself or talk to a friend about a drink or sandwich or something, and  I’ll get back, “ugh. I wish I could drink.” “Ugh I wish I could eat  that.” I don’t know how to combat this, because my friends don’t have  eating disorders. They don’t struggle with restriction the way that I do  and I don’t want to crap on their personal choices, but I  just.don’t.understand. why people feel the need to cut things out  completely (barring having specific off-limits foods due to allergies or  illness), and I don’t know how to act okay with it if someone talks to  me about it? I don’t know how to drown it out. I wish I could stay off  of social media for the entire month, but I need it for work. I’m not  someone who is anti self-improvement. I understand that some people  simply want to lose weight for health reasons. I understand that some  people simply want to give up alcohol for a bit. I just don’t understand  why everything has to be done in an extreme way. I don’t understand why  you have to completely eliminate something to live a healthier  lifestyle (if that’s your main goal).  

 I’m a competitive person.  When stuff like this is all people talk about, when they say you just  need some willpower, it’s so difficult to sit back and ignore it.

If I see something on my plate that I don't recognize, I immediately get tense and lose my apetite. Once upon a time, I could only eat chicken nuggets and Lucky Charms, although my palette has expanded considerably since then. Even so, I can't touch ethnic food of any sort, I hate when my steaks, burgers or hotdogs are anything other than plain and dry and I can't touch pizza.

683,aaqid6,Request: Any Advice Or Tips For Recovering Without Professional Help?,"21 year old male. I was diagnosed at 15 with EDNOS. The severity went down but the disordered eating never really went away. It flared up this summer with a binge cycle that lasted like a month. And then for the past four months it's been a mix of restriction and half-hearted attempts to try and make myself eat so I don't get ""bad enough"". I've had what I call ""mini relapses"" before - it never lasted for more than 2 weeks. But I'm here 4 months later and at my lowest weight ever. Granted, I'm still in the health weight range, but if I keep on like this, I'll be underweight. And I have this intuitive sense that being underweight won't be enough to satisfy the ED either.

Most of my support network doesn't really know. I'm in a program to get sober (almost 9 months sober) and I've mainly just been talking to my sobriety mentor about it since I feel it has the potential to spur a relapse into drinking.

I want to learn how to eat normally. My mentor's been trying to work with me to get into some kind of regular and reasonable eating pattern. I'm trying to work with him because I really just do not have any extra money for any sort of professional help (therapist, etc.)

My main block right now is that every time I eat I get consumed by worry that I'm going to gain weight. A lot of times I get nailed with panic attacks and really intense urges to make myself throw up after eating, even if it's a small meal or barely a snack. The anxiety surrounding meals is bad enough that most of the time I just skip meals even if I'm hungry and have been hungry for hours and hours.

Does anyone have any tips, advice or suggestions on how to overcome this type of anxiety? Even if it's something that just helps lessen it? I want to recover. But the same time I can't see how I can stay committed to recovery long-term if I'm having panic attacks and anxiety when I eat?

684,aakhrm,Request: How To Help A Friend Whose Not In Recovery,"My friend is going to be staying at my house for about a week to escape their awful family. My friend seems to me to have a very disordered relationship to food. They’re vegan and restrict a lot. They’ve admitted to me that they don’t eat enough, and have at points tried to brag about weight loss to me. The seem super stressed when faced with food. I’ve made it clear to them that I’m worried about them.

Over the past two years I slipped into dieting and restriction, but this fall I realized I was going in the direction of an ED and made myself stop restricting.

My first worry is about how to provide food to them. At school they usually only eat the same two or three foods. The meals I’ll be making them will be vegan, but the meals I make for myself and my parents won’t be. I love to cook so if a eating competent guest was coming I would be making them elaborate meals. But if do that for my friend, I doubt they would eat it. I don’t mind wasting food just to put it in front of them to give them the option of eating it, but I’m worried doing that might make them more stressed about eating. Is that something I should be worried about? Also, should I keep the foods I see them actually eat at school around the house?

My second worry is how to maintain my own eating with them around. One of the things that I have the hardest times with is eating around other people.

Do other people see me as this large? Did she see these ginormous clothes and think this is how large I am? Luckily the Christmas dinner mayhem was enough to distract people from noticing all I ate was carrots.

How do you all handle set backs like these? It's hard when I finally feel some recovery behaviour and one comment or action brings me back to the beginning. Anyone else having set-backs after Christmas? How do you get yourself back on track to recovery after an incident like this?",1546081837,12/29/2018 5:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/aakfxs/request_gifted_xl_clothes_for_xmas_and_has_set_me/,13
690,aa9bi7,Request: I Thought I'd Recovered But Now I'm Not Sure,"I'm almost 24, on the short end of average, and at the high end of a healthy weight range. Beginning when I was 13 until about 15/16, I had some pretty anorexic eating habits. I saw the doctor once in that time and I didn't have access to a scale, so I'm unsure what effects the extreme restriction and exercise had on my body. I've never been diagnosed or hospitalized due to an ED, but I remember my goals and I once found (and quickly destroyed) an old food diary. I know I can't post numbers, but suffice to say I wasn't getting anywhere near enough calories for a teenage girl. By 16, calorie restriction and exercise had taken up i'd say at least 50% of my energy for the better part of 3 years. Work and uni took that over, until I graduated, and by age 20-21 I was restricting again. This time it was different, though. I went vegan and aimed for the lowest possible caloric goal that could be considered healthy. According to my food diaries from that time, I ended up short of that goal on the regular.

 Fast forward to January '18, and I'm at an urgent care facility for an increasingly irregular and at times absent heartbeat. They dismiss me since my EKG levels are fine, but refer me to a specialist. I start taking magnesium on a Google tip and my heart rate has gotten more normal in the months since, but I've been fatigued all year and I've been sleeping 10-12 hours daily. I'm tired of feeling like I'm sick when i'm in my twenties and I should be more....idk, alive. 

Anyway, I guess I'm typing all this out because I feel like i'm tricking myself into blaming an ED so I can eat more when I don't actually need to eat more, I should just eat better. Plus, my family knows about my history with food and no one has ever said my eating is disordered. I lived with them up to age 20 and on and off since and if I really had a problem, they would've noticed. On top of that, no doctor has suggested i'm not eating enough (I saw one at 15, and a PA earlier this year). I guess it never crosses anyone's mind cause I'm not skinny and I don't want to do anything about it myself because sometimes I'd rather die looking the way i do now than with an extra 15 pounds. Idk. I know that's a horrible thing to say but I'm pretty sure most people and esp other women kind of feel that way too. 


Clearly I'm not sure though, I don't know how disordered my attitudes are and I guess i'd like to hear from people who have experience with actual EDs?",1545994207,12/28/2018 4:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/aa9bi7/request_i_thought_id_recovered_but_now_im_not_sure/,2

About 4 months ago I became extremely ill and was diagnosed with stomach ulcers, which have resulted in a significant loss of appetite and weight. Everyone in my family seems to have noticed my weight loss (they were not aware of my ED) and seem to feel the need to comment on how good I'm looking, and how small I've become. It's been extremely difficult for me to not slip back into the mindset of weight loss, and attempts to lose more. I can't help but notice how much better I look now than I did before I got sick, knowing very well it's unhealthy and detrimental to my mental and physical health.

693,a9ybjm,Request: My Boyfriend's Diet And Exercise Habits Seem Disordered But He Thinks He's Just Improving Himself?,"I'm 22f, he's 24m. I know not he's not the typical demographic for an eating disorder but I'm getting more and more worried about him! When we started dating he was chubby, he stayed like this for the first year with periodic episodes of dieting and randomly starving himself for a few days. (Maybe I should have considered that a warning sign but I just thought of it as him being silly) Now he has lost a significant amount of weight by starving, but he calls it fasting. He jokes about it to me and his friends, he seems completely unbothered by it (at least in front of others). He talks about how ""water fasting"" is actually really healthy and how he's reprogramming his body etc. He thinks every overweight person should do it too.

He has lost a pretty crazy amount of weight in the last couple of months. He probably eats only 3 times a week, always protein/fats and vegetables. He takes pills that stop him feeling hungry. I've tried to mention that I'm concerned, but he brushes it off, or if it's around other people, jokes about my concern. He thinks he is healthier but he does not seem to be. When not around his friends he is usually irritable and he has no libido anymore.. and his toxic way of thinking is scaring me.

He mentioned that he had to make himself throw up after Christmas because his family didn't understand fasting and that he can't ""poison himself"" anymore. Any bad food is ""poison"" to him. I'm not allowed to eat bad foods either. I was never self conscious of food and my weight before, now I am, and I find myself eating less and less even though I'm already skinny. Things that always kind of bothered me now REALLY bother me, like my slight double chin and fat legs. I worry he sees me in the same distorted way he sees his own body (any amount of fat is disgusting to him)

He used to be so cute and jokey and silly, he still acts that way in front of other people, but around me he is now neurotic, serious and obsessed with ""being the best version of himself"". He exercises every day and he's not happy until he is in physical pain. He works 50 hour weeks on top of all this and I'm worried he is completely burning himself out.

People compliment him loads on his new look and motivation, this encourages him. When I bring this up to other people they think I'm crazy , they see his new toned body and assume everything must be going great. Maybe I AM overreacting idk. I guess he does know a lot about what he's doing, he tracks everything meticulously. He says he plans to increase calories once he has got down to his goal weight, he says he doesn't want to be skinny, he wants to be lean and toned.

Not sure what to do. Is this worrying? I don't know how to help him, or maybe this is just the new him now. What should I do?

Tips For Not Giving Into Fear &amp; Relapsing?,"Im 19F, home from college for the holidays, and with the support of my parents I’m about 3 days into recovery. I probably wouldn’t have decided to recover if they didn’t comment on how worried they were at how sick I look. Then, I thought I was fully committed but I’m terrified.

There’s so much information about intake minimums that I don’t know what to follow, and due to financial reasons I cannot afford professional treatment. I’ve been watching as much YouTube videos as possible to get educated on all things recovery but I’m still so afraid and lost. To be honest I’ve been watching recovery videos for the past month because I kind of suspected I would be forced to recover once I got home. But I still feel like the rules of “eat lots and LOTS of food” don’t apply to me somehow.

I’ve been working hard to follow physical hunger cues but I get so full so fast, and of course this leads me to believe I’m eating too much even though it’s not even half of what recovery guidelines suggest for intake minimums. However if I were following mental cues I would probably double that, ahaha. The fear just gets to me. And I’m already thinking about how I can just go back to low restricting once I’m back at college. I just wish I wasn’t underestimating what I think I’m allowed even though it’s much more food than I’m used to.

Could just use some encouragement I guess and some symbolic permission to eat as much as I want without fear of doubling in size overnight",1545908234,12/27/2018 4:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/a9yap7/request_how_much_do_i_eat_in_recovery_tips_for/,4
696,ae5qln,Request: How To Stop Binging/Purging On Your Own?,"I binge/purge about 1-3 per week, this has been going on for the past month only. I binge to comfort myself when I feel really lonely and sad, it's the same routine each time: lay on the couch and eat while I watch a movie, purge when I start feeling really sick and too full to eat anymore.

I just go to the store beforehand and buy some junk food. I decide to do this kinda spontaneously, I'll be thinking about it, trying to dismiss the thought, then deciding ""fuck it, let's go.""

It doesn't make me feel better, though. It just makes me stressed afterwards. I think this is why my skin is looking really bad and why I often feel physically ill and lethargic. It makes me feel like I have to work really hard in the days afterwards to eat less, exercise more, go back to ""normal"" and try to be healthy again.

And it makes me feel like I can't see anybody(like, make social plans) until I'm ""back to normal"", otherwise I think I look bloated or something from the binging.

My weight has stayed the same which is surprising. I thought surely I'd be gaining. I'm very worried about all this binging making me fat because I place a lot of value on not getting fat. It's weird because I think my self-esteem is usually positive and good, but I'm so focused on me not gaining weight because I worry that if I do, I will feel terribly about myself, when I was a higher weight I felt awful.

I'd like more control. Binging and purging makes me very secretive. Making sure I buy my junk food at the store as quickly as possible, even going to different stores so they don't remember, oh that's the person who always buys the junk food.

I can't afford therapy or treatment but if I could I really would refuse to go because honestly I have a phobia of treatment from bad experiences when I was in high school. I would rather die than go there. I would really appreciate any tips or advice you have for getting out of this cycle because it feels like an addiction.

698,adumzb,Request: unable to control my appetite," 

I have this horrible habit of over eating. Here's my current situation for Context.

I've had Depression since I was 12 and I HARDCORE used food as a coping mechanism. I continued to gain weight up until about 6 months ago when i went through therapy and worked out my depression. Since then it comes back every now and again but nothing like it used to be. I'm 90% depression free.

After a month of being free from depression I decided I wanted to lose weight so I did. But my weightloss train was quickly highjacked by Ana. I heavily restricted for about 4 1/2 months. Losing a great deal of weight in the process. @ my heaviest I was only a few pounds from being morbidly obese and now I'm stuck in between the obese and overweight BMI line.

Ever since New Years Eve when I broke my strict calorie limit I've been unable to control my appetite. I eat even when I'm so full my stomach hurts and I hate it.

I know it's not bordom eating, I think it's a combination of malnutrition, loneliness, and something else.

(Note. I'm 16 years old and legally working 55 hrs./5 days A week. I'm incredibly social so working for such long hours keeps me from socializing a lot.)

(I take care of an elderly couple as my job, not physically taxing, just long hours.)

This caused a lot of body image  issues and I’ve always hated my body for this reason. So around june or  july twenty-seventeen I decided i was gonna loose weight. So i tried  going vegetarian. That worked out for about a month or so but when i  realized i wasn’t loosing weight i went back to my old eating habits.  Fast forward to mid september. I discovered pro-ana communities and I  was fascinated. I wanted to be as skinny as the girls in the photos. So I  started to eat less and less. Then I started to exercise frequently. I  saw results and had lost very little at this point.Then I started to  purge anything I ate. It started off slow like maybe once or twice a  week? Then it picked up to once every day. I then started to use  laxatives. They didn’t really work for me but I still used them because I  simply didn’t want to give them up. Then I found weight loss pills in  the kitchen cabinet and started taking those. So by this point I had  lowered my calorie intake quite a bit, and then purging was with that.  Often I would do twenty four hour fasts but after completing them I’d  binge massively. Binging became a huge thing I did. It got to the point  where I had a bag in my room so I didn’t have to go to the bathroom to  purge. Then January twenty eighteen came around and I decided to do a  liquid fast for the month of January. This went well for about a week or  so then my parents made me eat spaghetti and I had a literal break  down. At that point I had lost a decent amount of weight but was still a  healthy weight.After the whole spaghetti incident, I lost control and  started binging constantly. I gained the weight back a few extra pounds  and was fine and nobody knew for months. I returned to eating normally  and then came july of twenty eighteen I started getting awful thoughts  about starving myself and did it for about a week then went back to  normal eating and that is what’s been going on up until now. I’m eating  normally and all but still purge sometimes when I can’t stand the  feeling of being full.  

 I’m sorry this was lengthy. I’ve been thinking and have thought that maybe I was doing this for attention. But at the same time why would I do it for attention? I made sure nobody knew. I don’t know anymore. I know I should probably see a counselor but honestly the thought of that terrifies me.

707,adak3m,Request: Working Through Weight Restoration," 

I am not critically underweight, but my BMI generally hovers in the ""underweight"" range. I have been eating at a caloric surplus, but it seems that after the weight “spikes” following increased food intake, it tends to taper off back to my original weight. I had BED prior to being diagnosed with AN, and I do still binge occasionally, so most of my caloric surplus has come from that. I often feel like I’m gaining weight even though that hasn’t been reflected on the scale, but I don’t know if that is because I’m actually gaining fat or because I have an eating disorder. Is it possible to gain fat without gaining weight? I’ve technically dropped weight over the past 3-4 weeks, even though I’ve been having several extremely high-calorie binges during that time. I don’t really restrict on my “off” days, but naturally I don’t eat as much, either.

Do I need to be increasing my intake to gain? I’m working with a dietitian who mentioned hypermetabolism, but I don’t know if that’s something that is actually happening. I guess I have a fear that all the increased food will come into effect retroactively and I’ll gain a significant amount of weight in a short period of time.

708,actaje,Request: I Don't Know If I Really Have An Eating Disorder But I Don't Think That What I'm Doing Is Normal.,"I guess I have a normal BMI but I haven't weighed myself in a long, long time. For most of the month I eat very healthily and I work out extensively every morning to start my day off. I'm pretty happy with the way my body looks when I mange to be active and healthy; I don't think it's an image issue. I'll allow myself a small treat every once in a while, so I don't think that's why I end up binging either. It's not like I'm unhappy about eating healthily; I actually enjoy it very much because it makes me feel wonderful.

However, every time my menstrual cycle begins, I have to start fighting my urges to eat until I feel sick. I just start craving food. I constantly tell myself not to do it as it's happening, but it's like my hands and mouth won't listen to what my brain is saying. I start in the morning and once I start I can't stop. I'll eat constantly from the time i quit exercising until about 3 or 4 o'clock. And a lot of it isn't healthy food. For example yesterday my mom and I made gingerbread cookies yesterday and earlier today I probably ate 7 of them. I ate so much other food I can't even remember it all.

When I finally manage to convince myself to stop eating, I always feel so disgusting and I hate myself for it. Then, the following week or so, I'll hardly eat any food at all. I'll eat a small piece of fruit or maybe some green pepper slices. One or the other. That's it for the whole day and sometimes I don't eat at all. I recently went four days without eating anything and when I tried having some apple slices I got so nauseous and sweaty and sick.

I would really like some advice on how I can control myself when I want to start binging. I'm always full, but I just crave the feeling of eating food. I'm really not sure why I do it.

No question is too personal, ask away. As long as it's relevant.

I lost a lot of weight in about 5 months and was diagnosed with  anorexia after telling my therapist about my issues surrounding food. I  began a partial hospitalization program and today the 4th is my last  day. My problem is that I feel like I still look fat. Like I’m the same  proportions I was before I began heavily restricting. I’m worried that a  majority of my weight loss was just muscle and visceral fat. My stomach  still feels so soft and squishy and jiggly. I feel like I still look  really fat. A girl I’ve been seeing and has been a big support in my  recovery  tries to reassure me that she doesn’t see any fat on my body  and that if I want to look more defined and less soft I should just  start working out with her.

I was treated for an eating disorder for 7 years and I've been a year recovered now which I'm extremely proud of and I haven't had many nasty thoughts, however I've recently started a new job and they all have lunch together in a huge noisy canteen that I hate, I've never been comfortable eating in front of people I don't know very well let alone in a busy place. They all eat so much and are constantly on about losing weight whilst they eat and it's been giving me so much anxiety and making my head go funny so I started sitting in my car for lunch but now they ask where I go and why I don't go up with them. I don't want to tell everyone why, I don't want to be the gossip or have people talking about me or what I'm eating or how much. I feel like it's a massive trigger I'm struggling to get past.

I think that one of my best friends (who is in her late 20s) is struggling with an ED. She is slightly overweight (but not noticeably so) and has dropped a significant amount of weight in the last month, weighs herself several times/day, exercises excessively, and will frequently eat the bare minimum (maybe a cup of soup per day, and that's it). She will not talk to her husband (and hides her restrictive behaviors from him) about the issues been having with food. 

How do I go about helping her, or bring up that I think that she may need to seek professional help? The last thing that I want to do is break her trust and have her try to fight this completely alone.

715,acgybp,Request: the world thinks i'm doing better when really i've hit rock bottom,"In the past 3 months, i've ended up somewhere i absolutely never wanted to be. I was overweight and just wanted to be healthy. I did everything how I was supposed to, recommended daily calorie intake and going to the gym 4 days a week. but the weight wasn't coming off fast enough, and i cut down my calories more and more and now i am where i am. 

i'm still on the higher end of a healthy bmi and am not done with the amount of weight i wanted to lose, but i realize the way i'm living isn't healthy and i don't even want to be this way. i maybe eat a meal a day, but i can never finish whatever it is i'm eating. i feel full after a few bites and either throw up or feel like i'm going to if i force myself to eat more. i'm so weak, i never even have the energy for the gym anymore. i can barely work 4 hours without getting lightheaded or barely being able to carry everything. i look in the mirror and still see myself as a whale. i even passed out while checking out at a gas station from not eating and gave myself a concussion. 

i realize something needs to change, but i don't want to ask for help because everyone thinks i've been doing the best i have in forever and i don't want anyone to know what's really going on. people keep commenting on how skinny i've gotten and how proud they are of me and it sucks when i know deep down i'm nothing to be proud of. 

how do i force myself to eat again? i just want to be healthy and strong like i once was and i can't do it eating a few bites of food everyday. but the feeling in my stomach after eating is just so painful that i dread eating because of it. i just don't know what to do.

716,acgxr7,Request: Seeking advice on how to deal with my body image or where i could go to find some help,"What started as an attempt to lose some weight using myfitnesspal spiralled out of control to become obsessive and restrictive. I used it religiously for half a year and became borderline underweight. For those of you who don't know, myfitnesspal is an app designed to calculate the calories intake of your food as well as set different goals for the different macronutrients you get from food including protein, fat, carbs, sugar, fibre and even the vitamins. calorie goals are set for you to meet every day based on your height, weight and weight loss goals. 

I have never been overweight, I have always been aware of that. But since I became a teenager, I had become curvy and carried some weight. I always received compliments from my friends. In fact, I was known for having really nice curves. Even so, I always have felt self-conscious and have been trying to lose weight somehow. I don't know where this self-consciousness comes from but it has always been there. Anyway, I had tried different ways of losing weight but none really worked. It was one night when I had been staying up late on my phone (I also struggle with insomnia but that is a different issue) when I stumbled across on a youtube video of a professional ballerina who uses a food diary to calculate her calories. Upon reading the comments, I had found several recommendations to use myfitnesspal as it was a much more convenient way to count your calories and had resulted in successful weight loss. 

I found a sudden surge of motivation to take this diet seriously and I promised to myself I wouldn't become a yo-yo dieter and stay committed. That I can say I certainly did. Perhaps I should've known that this wasn't a good idea since I have the tendency to become obsessed with something to the point where it becomes the prime focus of my life. Then I downloaded the app and began my diet. 

In the first few weeks, I can say that I wasn't obsessive. I ate as I normally would, only estimating the portion sizes of my food and learning how to use the app. To my surprise, I wasn't too hungry either. I was enjoying using the app as I saw it as a way to learn how to eat healthily and control my appetite. It was then when I started to lose weight. It happened very rapidly and my parents could notice it straight away. Receiving compliments, I had found a new appreciation for my body. For the first time in years, I actually felt comfortable in my skin; I loved the way I looked and began to feel addicted to weight loss. 

More and more of my spare time became dedicated to my new diet and I spent hours researching recipes and reading articles on the app itself. One article, in particular, stood out saying that you should weigh your food in order to reach an accurate estimate of your caloric intake. Another article warned against eating food and then not logging it into the app as it would hinder your weight loss. I took all this very seriously and stepped up the dieting a notch. Now every single thing I ate whether it was strawberries or pasta, I weighed using measuring scales. I would always cook my own food and prepare my school lunch by myself. at school, everyone complimented me on how healthy my lunch looked or how much they wished they could be as dedicated to their diet as me. no one saw it as dangerous. whenever I was offered any food, whether it was from my friends or family, I would always refuse it. I thought that if I didn't completely stick to my diet it would be a failure. I never went over my calorie goal or my macronutrient goals for any day. 

As I carried on losing weight I also received different sorts of comments. I went on holiday to my home country in the summer where I met all my family that didn't live in England, where I currently live. Having not seen me for a year, the weight loss was much more apparent. They would compliment me but then also add at the end that they thought I had lost too much weight. I completely dismissed this as I thought their idea of what was underweight was outdated. I thought they were refusing to be happy for my accomplishment as they didn't realise how much dedication I had put into looking the way I did. Retrospectively, I know they were only speaking the truth: I had lost too much weight. 

Meanwhile, I had also noticed that I had been missing my period for a long time. Actually, I had stopped getting my period the moment I began my diet. And to be honest, it didn't concern me. As long as I was losing weight, it didn't matter to me. Every time I wasn't eating, I was obsessively thinking about what I would eat next. I would fall asleep fantasising about breakfast, and wake up ravenous. A lot of times my mum would ask me if I was hungry but I always said I wasn't, even if I was. I had begun to also exercise at every opportunity because then I could add on the calories the app and be able to eat more. I told myself it was so that i could lose more weight but I knew deep down it wasn't true. 

Eventually, I came to the realisation that I had lost enough weight so I changed the settings of the app so that I would maintain my weight. I thought that this would resolve my issues, that I wouldn't be hungry anymore, yet I was. I still felt that same hunger in my stomach all the time and wished I could eat whatever I wanted. but I was afraid I would gain weight. it was my biggest fear. I was beginning to accept that I had to change something. I spoke to my mum and asked her if she thinks I should stop using the app since its making me unhappy and stressing me out. she told me that I should because she knows people who have lost huge amounts of weight and then gained it all back, sometimes even more than before. She was worried the same thing would happen to me. So I listened to her. I continued using the app. 

Sometime later, I went on an expedition with my school where I had to walk about thirty km over the course of two days while carrying a backpack that was extremely heavy. Being at the weight I was, this was too much physical exertion for my body to handle. I began throwing up and became faint on many occasions as i refused to eat anything even remotely sugary. I struggled to have the strength needed to carry on. At one point, my friend had to carry my bag for me so that i could get a break. at night I had a long conversation with myself where I promised myself that i would change something. It was something of a revelation. 

When I arrived home I told my mum that I would stop using the app completely and go back to my normal way of eating. I also told her that I had been missing my periods and we rung up the doctor the next day. The doctor had told me that i was borderline underweight and needed to gain some weight. So I did. I deleted the app. I ate as much as I could every day and ensured that I satisfied my appetite all the time. I felt guilty about it though because it was so easy for me to eat so much. i felt like a failure because i had managed to abandon my diet so easily. I felt like I was eating so much and without even being able to taste the food. perhaps I wasn't eating that much food but I was just used to eating much less. 

I was called back to the doctor about a month later to be weighed. The nurse had weighed me and told me I had gained weight and was now at a healthy weight. She thought that because my weight had changed so much in about a month that my weighing scales must have been broken or something when I had weighed my self previously. However, I ensured that I had just put on weight. I didn't tell her that I had been on a calorie restrictive diet though. on the way home I cried in the car and my mum asked me why. It was because I had gained weight. She assured me that i could always lose a few kgs if I wanted to since my weight was a little past the limit of being ""healthy"". 

Now it has been several months since I have returned to normal eating and I now face new challenges. I absolutely hate the way I look even though i know it is necessary for me to be at this weight. I feel like a failure because I became the very thing I despised: a yo-yo dieter. I lost weight then gained it all back. I avoid looking at myself naked and sometimes cry if I do. I know I am not fat but I still feel fat. 

I apologise for the length of my post but I really felt like this was the appropriate place for me to tell my story. I don't know where to go to find a therapist and I do realise that I hadn't developed an eating disorder but perhaps i was on the verge of doing so. My parents both don't have a very good understanding of mental health issues. To them, my dieting was a just a phase. They dont see the damaging effect it has had on my mental health. I want to develop a healthy relationship with food but I still have a long way to go. Additionally, I still haven't had my period yet, making it a total of 8 months that i have missed it. It is worrying me but I am going to have a blood test tomorrow. 

Thank you if you have read this all the way to the end. I really would appreciate if anyone could give me some advice on how to deal with my body image or where i could go to find some help. I want to improve myself and I feel like this is a good place to start. 

PS: Also I want to emphasize that myfitnesspal isn't a bad app. I honestly think it is a reliable way of ensuring weight loss that is consistent and controlling your appetite. For some people, this is really useful. However, if you have tendencies to be obsessive (like me) I would suggest you stray away from calorie counting apps in general.

717,accyyy,Request: Advice For Breakup Triggered Relapses? Absolutely No Appetite,"Hey all,

For reference, I’m a 20 year old female.

So, about a month ago, my boyfriend broke up with me. It was a pretty rough breakup (after 3 years, no warning signs, on our anniversary, over text), and since then my ed has resurfaced with a vengeance. I hadn’t necessarily “recovered”, but I was close. Anorexia had become more of a mild annoyance than the life-consuming ordeal it had been a few years prior. I won’t lie, my relationship - and specifically my partner - played a big role in those steps towards recovery. I gained a bit of weight (and wasn’t thrilled), but I don’t think I realized quite how much this relationship kept me grounded with my mentality until now.

Since then, I have absolutely no appetite. I can’t tell if it’s the heartbreak, or the ed, but I think it must be some combination of the two. It’s been weeks now. Everything makes me nauseated to even look at or smell, to the point I need to leave the room. During previous relapses, not eating was still a struggle. I still wanted food, but denied it. Now I can’t stand anything, and I’ve lost 15 pounds in four weeks, and have dropped into the ""Underwieht. It’s not my lowest, but it’s still much lower than I’ve been in a while.

I guess I just don’t know what to do. Before, at least I could stand the sight of food. But now I don’t even know how to get my stomach onboard with my mind. I’m at the point where I want to eat, but just can’t.

If anyone has any advice, or has been through something similar, I’d love any tips. Or even anything to increase appetite. Thanks so much!",1546566110,1/3/2019 19:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/accyyy/request_advice_for_breakup_triggered_relapses/,4

She has been to an eating disorder facility previously which helped but she had to leave early because she started having seizures again. Her seizures have gotten really bad again and she had multiple a day.

The local clinic refused to take her due to her seizures, and the one place that previously took her did not know how to handle her seizures and she ended up very injured and almost died.

Getting help for eating disorders is something best done sooner rather than later, and waiting to see if her seizures decrease in frequency is a moot point if she needs help now.

Does anyone know of any safe eating disorder facilities for adults that also take people with active seizures?

I have always been underweight and it’s showed because I always get people telling me I’m way too skinny. I’ve always Hated the way my body looks when I look into the mirror(their was a point where I had to take my mirrors down that showed more than my just my head). I usually wear large sweatshirts so people can’t see my arms, although I do go out wearing just a tshirt when it gets too summer, but the whole time I’m pretty self conscious about how skinny my arms are.

I don’t hate food, I just can’t be bothered to try to eat more than 1 or sometimes 2 a meals day, because I just don’t have an interest in wanting to eat food most of the time. I can feel myself hungry, I just don’t want to eat and I don’t know why.

I have been going through a pretty depressive stage within the last few months of last year, but my eating habits are nothing new. I have been like this for like since 6/7 years ago when I was in secondary school, I never ate the lunch that my mum had for me and got into a lot of trouble.

So I’ve started to think that maybe I’ve had an eating disorder this whole time and just never addressed it, I just can’t find anything similar online to what I’m feeling or going through, so I keep thinking that maybe I’m just attaching the label of an ED onto my situation.

722,agjy0x,Request: Advice From Those Who’ve Struggled Over A Decade....,"So I’ve had my eating disorder for almost 14 years, I’m 26 now this all started when I was 12. Why it started, who knows never figured that out when I’ve been in and out of therapy and what not. I’m not invalidating anyone who hasn’t suffered as long, I truly only envy you. I just feel like I need to connect to people who are in a similar spot, or someone who’s beaten this after struggling for so long. My weight has been all over, high average, average and underweight. Right now I’m at the low average end, and not actively in treatment. I was working with a therapist and dietician, I didn’t like the therapist, loved my dietician but she stopped seeing me after my suicide attempt. So I’ve been out of active recovery for like 8 months. Things are up and down for me. Mentally, not just ED wise, depression, anxiety, drinking too much have really been close to ruining my life.

So aside from my rant, if you’ve beat ED after years, HOW!! I think a lot of my issues go hand in hand with my ED. I think that right now I feel like I wouldn’t be taken seriously because I’m not underweight, and I’ve had several therapists in the past not take me seriously because I don’t look like I’m dying. I struggled mainly with purging, abusing laxatives, and restriction. Now it kinda loops between the three, mostly restriction. I have tachycardia, a couple of fake teeth, other severe dental damage and unstable vitals. I just don’t feel like appearance wise I would be taken seriously and I don’t know what to do. I’m only asking people who’ve suffered long term because I’m worried I’m going to be 45 hiding purging from my prospective family..... Like when did you decide enough was enough? What helped? I don’t know what to do. I constantly want to kill my self to not have to deal with these thoughts. I beat myself up for not taking my help more seriously when I had a really good team behind me. Now I’m stuck, I’ve been through so many therapists in my area I don’t know what to do anymore. 

Sorry for the rant, I just need advice from someone who’s been through this because I just don’t want to live like this at all anymore, and I’m worried I’m hitting a threshold and it will explode and I will end up dead.

I'm also a bit more than a year into recovery from anorexia. Yesterday, I went to take out my trash to our trash room and noticed a trash bag with empty Ensure bottles inside. This immediately reminded me of myself last year, as I was instructed to drink Ensures for weight restoration. I feel as though seeing these in the trash room could only mean that one of my residents has an ED, but I have no idea who it could be. I feel a degree of responsibility for this: what could I have done to prevent her ED? Is there anything I could do to help? I'm not close enough with my residents to really feel like I could approach anyone about it, but I'm worried that if I let it go, things could get worse, or my resident might feel alone. Or, am I blowing this out of proportion? 
Additionally, this has brought back some really conflicting feelings for me. I feel a desire to restrict again, and noticed myself planning to restrict and looking at old pictures of myself and of other ideal pictures. Is this normal? I don't want this to lead to a relapse, because I've been doing so well in recovery. How can I not blame myself for the possibility of my resident having an ED?

727,ag788u,Request: Dealing With The Weight That Comes With Recovery,"So i’ve struggled with this disorder for about 5 years now, i’ve been to many therapists and doctors and for years all hoped seemed lost. i felt like i’d never get over this feeling of needing to look a certain way, only to realize when i got to that certain weight, i still was never satisfied. a little over a year ago, i was incredibly underweight with a diet that consisted of coffee and cigarettes mostly. i also met a guy, who i now live with and am head over heels for. i was fairly open with him about my problems with weight right from the beginning, and he always encouraged me to eat and to love myself in a way that wasn’t ever condescending or problematic. 

now fast forward to today, january 2019. i’m at a healthy weight and haven’t skipped meals or purged in about 10 months. i don’t miss feeling dizzy and weak and light headed all the time, or any of the other health problems that came with starving myself. but there’s a lot of times where i can’t help but grab at my skin and think back to how i looked when i was underweight. i find myself looking at old pictures a lot too, wishing i still looked like that. 

i guess my question is how can i be okay with how i look now? i spent five years hating myself, and now i kind of don’t but still i kind of do? i hope i’m not being too confusing or asking silly questions here. i’m just looking for any advice on how to deal with the weight gain that comes with recovery and how i can stop comparing my past self with my current self. any feedback or advice is very much appreciated.

I've always been a little depressed and pretty anxious. Anxiety is reaching a high now as the semester is about to start and I still have to take final exams from last semester because of a nasty concussion I got before finals. I'm not even binging but I'm still purging after ""normal"" sized meals which leave me feeling so bloated and full since I'm not used to eating normally again.

Parents found my weed-was using it for my anxiety and to feel hungry but I know it demotivates me and I've stopped recently anyways. They're still pretty upset and it makes me feel so shit considering how I've always tried to be the ""good"" kid cause my 20 year old younger brother still manages to cause a lot of familial problems and home life (I'm home cause of winter break) has been rocky. Still worried about going to school since my mom won't have me to talk to or help her around the house since my dad is gone all day till late at work Mon-Fri. They also want me to break up with my long distance boyfriend (we met in college, he graduated I'm finishing up) that I've been keeping a secret-this is because he works for a cannabis company in CA. Don't really want to eat and when I do I physically feel sick and sluggish and it makes me want to vomit. On the few occasions I binge (which for me is really maybe just a normal person's version of a large meal) I always have to purge after.

I need help but I hate asking for it. Hate talking about my problems. Makes them so much more real for me since I've been so good at covering up my emotions and ED for years and years. Just needed to get that off my chest-I've tried therapy before for a little but stopped because I fell into a rut and I was ashamed. Just don't know how I'm gonna get back into this.

734,afun3k,Request: Should I Get Diagnosed Even After Recovery?,"Last year I attempted to lose weight which basically ended up as an eating disorder. I restricted my calories intake, started purging, could never stop thinking about food, etc. The typically horrible behaviours and thought patterns that come with ED stuff. The thing is, although I went to counselling a few times and spoke to my doctor about it, I was never diagnosed. I essentially recovered or am still recovering on my own.

A year later, I am still confused how this all happen. Especially since I don’t think I fit a specific criteria for any disorder. For example, I’m not sure if I was anorexic because I wasn’t very underweight and I wasn’t at that weight for an extended time. I don’t think I’d be considered bulimic because my binging and purging cycles were sometimes very frequent and then I’d last weeks without them. It was very strange.

Now, I’m at a point where I’m trying to continue to develop a healthy mindset around body image and food. I have even considered starting a social media or something of that sort to offer advice. But the one thing that holds me back is that I’ve never had an official diagnosis. I feel like I’m not “qualified” or I wasn’t “sick enough” or I wasn’t “sick long enough” to openly share my struggle, even though I logically know how damaging this time of my psyche.

I’m becoming increasingly concerned that I may have a problem with binge eating. I’m not sure what signs to look for beyond just over eating.

737,aeu6vc,Request: dreading I'm in withdrawl,"For the past three years, I have had group therapy for an eating disorder called OSFED (other specified feeding or eating disorder). I received this diagnosis, because I used to show signs of anorexia and bulimia (episodes of dieting followed by months of overeating, purging and exercising excessively). I used to be underweight, but my weight is healthy now. I haven't purged for a year and my life isn't being completely affected by my ED. Recovery felt long and difficult, but it's all worth it. 

However, I'm dreading I'm in withdrawal. My body-image is becoming more negative for the past few months. Simultaneously, I binge-eat once or twice a week. I'm terrified of the scale and I'm feeling obligated to exercise. If I refuse to exercise, I'll start to talk myself down (""I'm lazy, not good enough"", etc.). Yesterday was a long day, so I started to binge-eat to diminish my stress, which worked counterproductive (as usual...). When I was choosing what to eat at a supermarket and a restaurant (I know, I was eating an embarrassing amount of food), I wondered why on God's green earth I was making the same mistake for years. I have stuffed myself hundreds of times with exorbitant amounts of disgusting food until I vomited, but I don't seem to learn my lesson! 

Am I just stupid? Or am I lacking self-control? Out of fear and frustration I went for a run today and I felt disgusting, embarrassed and weak. I want to cry so badly, because I really want to let go of my ED and live a normal life, but I don't know how. Am I just overreacting? Many people have told me 'that it isn't that bad, because you're healthy now', which pisses me off to no end. Can anyone relate to this?

I was previously at a normal weight. Those 6-8 months, I lost quite a bit of weight and family and friends expressed concern (I'm tall so it was noticeable) but they never really found out what was going on. I consulted a priest to get help through my faith (which I did partly because I knew he couldn't tell anyone, and my parents wouldn't find out) and managed to stop. Since then, I have gone through week-long periods of purging a couple times a year yet have been without it for about 6 months straight now (typically when I'm extremely stressed about something), somewhat of a record for me, and I'm willing to make it last forever this time. 

Question: I used to have a resting heart rate of around 70 bpm, I know this because we had to take our heart rates in biology classes and gym classes somewhat consistently. However, when the purging started, and even now, my heart rate had risen to around 88 bpm. I am tall, I workout regularly, and I do enjoy coffee but I always have. My weight is in the normal range, my BMI is normal, and I have a healthy blood pressure. I don't know how to fix this... and it scares me. Will I always have this problem?

My mum has always struggled with her weight and is now finally in a position where she can do something about and is losing weight in a measured and healthy way. I’m very proud of her and have said as much.

Though now in recovery, I’ve suffered with bulimia for over 15 years and I’m finding her constant conversations about food and weight loss are causing me to get closer and close to a relapse (in fact today I’m struggling to eat my lunch because of it).

She knows I have had an eating disorder in the past and I have said a couple of times now “I’m really proud that you’re feeling healthier, but I still struggle with my eating disorder daily. Please could you not talk to me about how much you’ve lost and what you’re eating as I find it very difficult to handle”. She agrees but goes back to doing it after.

This is a all made worse by the fact that in recovery I’ve gained quite a lot of weight and am very unhappy with my body.

Today it became too much when after an unrelated conversation she told me what she was eating for lunch (low-fat, low-cal everything) and how many syns are in it. Since then I’ve not been able to eat my lunch and am worried that I’m going to relapse fully.

Can anybody offer any advice as to how I can proceed? I figure at this point there’s not much I can do to change her behaviour, but perhaps I can find some way to cope?

Until then I just have a few questions because it’s eating me up inside.

1) I really push myself to eat more than I’d like but I’m nowhere near the MM minimums. I’ve read Staying below this minimum can actually just suppress your metabolism worse and not do any good healing for your body, resulting in loads of fat gain and no damage repair. Is this true? Should I push myself to get closer to those minimums?

2)I lost my period for about 2 months, but I was really only severely starving myself for around 4 months during this relapse(I’ve still been struggling with an ED for years, I’m not making excuses to not recover like “not ill enough”, this is just for context). I got it back 2 weeks ago somehow, like a week into eating more food, and now two weeks later I’m having it again. This time though it’s sort of alarming. I’ve literally never had such a heavy period in my life so I’m wondering if this is a sign that I’m eating too much or I’m magically weight restored? I know that sounds crazy but I’m just so lost.

3) Is waking up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat a sign of “hyper metabolism” in recovery? Does this mean I should be eating more?

Clearly I just don’t know how to go about this or how much I should be eating. I know nobody here is my doctor but any insight would help. Thanks",1548031763,1/20/2019 18:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ai4jru/request_are_these_signs_that_im_eating_enough_too/,6
753,ai4j8g,Request: I think i have an eating disorder... now what?,"I’ve always been conscious of my weight even thought i’ve never had problems with being over weight. Around 6 months ago i became vegan and started working out. I pretty much only became vegan bc i thought it would help me be thinner, but i slowly got into the animal cruelty stuff etc. I also started working out regularly at this time. I knew I didn’t need to loose weight, but i still wanted to be thinner so i made sure i was doing workouts that would burn fat even though i was telling my parents i was only working out to burn some extra energy (i have attention problems). 

Fast forward to around a month ago, i realize that i’m skinnier. I lost weight. I knew it was a combination of my diet and working out, but i didn’t say anything to my parents (i’m a minor btw). Today i went for my annual physical, and i knew it was gonna be brought up since they take height/weight and they have my previous weight from past visits as well. My doctor definitely noticed and told me I have to start eating meat and she’ll give me a few weeks to come back for a follow up to see how much weight i’ve gained. I also met with a dietician and he told me that what i’m eating is no where near the nutrition i need. I argued with him for a little, telling him how i was really against eating animal products because it’s morally wrong, but in reality i just don’t want to gain the weight back. 

I’m not sure if i have an eating disorder or not, but if i do what’s gonna happen if i don’t gain the weight? The doctor mentioned something about being checked into an eating clinic if i don’t gain the weight, will this cost my parents a lot of money?

754,ai4in3,Request: Seeking advice for helping a client,"Hello, I have a tricky situation and I've just discovered this subreddit. I'm still exploring, hoping it will help me, but I thought I would reach out to you as well. I'm a recovery worker for a charity. In the strictest sense, my job is to counsel people with a drug or alcohol addiction until they reach abstinence and then discharge them. Often, tackling an addiction means tackling many other aspects of a person's life, as no healthy, well-adjusted adult wakes up and decides they want to begin a life-controlling addiction. To meet the needs of clients and help them sustain change, I end up helping with mental health aspects often. 

I have just met with a client that wants support sustaining a healthier relationship with alcohol. She struggled with an eating disorder in the past and basically used alcohol to overcome it in the sense that she would drink heavily on days where she was feeling very aware/down about her appearance and in the sense that the calories in alcohol meant that she didn't have to struggle to eat more and stay in a weight range where her family or friends wouldn't question her. I am very concerned that she is on a see-saw between alcohol dependence and disordered eating, but I have not had experience in discussing disordered eating before. I have been consulting all of my colleagues and reading anything related to eating disorders I can get my hands on. 

I'd like to hear from people who are experiencing or have overcome something similar to help round out my knowledge. I have a care plan in place for her that I'm very hopeful about, but I'd like to ask about some day-to-day tips that might be meaningful to her, with your permission. Many of the day-to-day things I would suggest to redirect energy from alcohol use I'm afraid would lead to her focusing on her appearance or relationship with food, such as working out regularly or finding passion in things like cooking.

 Can anyone suggest general health-promoting activities have helped with people experiencing an eating disorder? Has anyone has had a similar experience to my clients and how they are dealing or have dealt with it?

755,ai4hlb,Request: How To Approach My Sister Whom I’m Fairly Sure Is Struggling With Orthorexia,"My (32f) sister (34f) is really struggling. She’s always had depression, and ever since she was a teen I believe she has been dealing with what I now am able to label as Orthorexia. It started with her being a vegan but really she used it as a mask to not have to eat anything. After about 8 years of that she stopped being vegan, but has always maintained a strict diet of non gmo, organic, non diary, local, farm fresh., gluten free...The list goes on. She is extremely controlling and obsessed about what she will and will not eat.

I also want to say that I was severely anorexic when I was a teen and got therapy and was able to kick it. For these reasons I’ve started to really notice some similarities in the way she thinks about and reacts to food.

She now has a 3 yr old and is pregnant with her second. She also got type 1 diabetes after the birth of her first child so the types of food she will eat and the obsession and control has gotten even worse. Her husband confided in me recently that he was with their son for the day while my sister was working, and his son really wanted to try a hot dog. He went out and got the healthiest hot dog he could find at the grocery store, and white hot dog buns. His son absolutely loved it and they had a blast trying them. As soon as my sister got home, she somehow dug the wrappers out of the garbage can and totally freaked out on her husband. The type of meltdown I remember having if someone tried to force me to eat when I was anorexic.

Her mental health has been spiralling for awhile now, but she always blames in on the lack of sleep from having a child. She refuses to acknowledge that it could be the anxiety, depression, obsessive control, diabetes, or any of the other on the long list of struggles.

I want to approach her with the possibility that she is dealing with Orthorexia, but as I recall, anybody that approached me about my anorexia was immediately shut down.

I don’t know what to do or how to help her.

Any advice would be great.

TL;DR I’m pretty sure my sister is struggling with Orthorexia and I don’t know how to approach it.",1548031364,1/20/2019 18:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ai4hlb/request_how_to_approach_my_sister_whom_im_fairly/,12

The way that I was raised, paired with some trauma revolving around food has left me with a child-like diet as an adult. When I go to try new things, I have panic attacks. When I try to have a healthier alternative, even if I like it, if carbs or sugar is around, I’m weak and won’t have any of the vegetables or whatever. It’s worse than an addiction.

759,ah42q8,Request: Told Boyfriend About ED for First Time," 

The past month has been really rough for me in terms of my AN. I  relapsed pretty hard and it took a toll on my mood and general outlook. I decided several days ago to make a harder push toward recovery. It’s  always easier said than done, and I was feeling particularly weak  yesterday. I told my boyfriend last night about my AN. He’s the first  person I’ve ever actually admitted it to.

Honestly, I don’t really know how it went. Is there ever a real  fairytale ending of revealing your ED to a loved one? He first responded  that I could always vent to him, but I can’t expect him not to get mad  when I feel the need to starve or purge. I told him anger only makes me  feel less inclined to open up about my feelings. He asked how he’s  supposed to react, that he’d never just be able to say he understands  and have no further reaction. Truthfully, I don’t know what reaction I  wanted. I didn’t want anger or pity. I don’t want him to feel like he’s  my therapist. I really just wanted him to know why I am the way I am. He  told me he wants to be sympathetic but it’s hard for him because he  doesn’t really understand EDs. I get that. I can’t expect him to  understand the feelings of a disorder he’s never experienced. I know he  at least cares about me getting better.

I feel like I shouldn’t have told him at all, though. I feel like I  put this burden on him, where he feels like he has a responsibility to  make me better. He keeps telling me he wants to help, but I don’t want  him to think he needs to fix me. I want to make myself better. It’s been  over a decade of this shit now. I want to recover for good.

Does anyone have advice for me?",1547768059,1/17/2019 17:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ah42q8/request_told_boyfriend_about_ed_for_first_time/,3
760,ah426l,Request: Gaining Weight in Recovery," 

I have been in a recovery program for the past few weeks. I don’t  have an official diagnosis and they’re using a transdiagnostic model,  but essentially I purge every time I feel full, even if I haven’t eaten  an abnormally large amount of food. I’m also fearful of gaining weight  and get triggered by certain foods. I was never trying to lose weight  (if I did, I guess it was a bonus) but purging eases be guilt of eating  and maybe gaining weight. 

I’m working with a therapist and a nutritionist, and essentially I’m  being tasked to eat six times a day, which I never did before (no  snacking between meals was a rule) and to incorporate more carbs and  starches into my diet. 

I’m really trying, but it feels like too much food and I’m starting  to gain weight. It’s not a lot, and I know that but it still terrifies  me because I was never underweight. I’ was actually toeing the line of  being (truly, realistically by definition) overweight when I started the  program. I just don’t feel like I NEED to gain weight, so maybe  following these new guidelines isn’t for me. Am I wrong, isn’t being  overweight unhealthy? Or is there a way I can work this out with my  therapist and nutritionist? ",1547767974,1/17/2019 17:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ah426l/request_gaining_weight_in_recovery/,12
761,ah41ux,Request: Help With Treatment!?," 

Hi all!! I live in a pretty  northern/rural area on Minnesota where healthcare options can be  limited and my insurance is also NOT overly willing to cover Eating  Disorder specific treatment. This has left me in a rough situation. 

Around this time last year I began at the Emily program and was  referred for residential, however, it wasn’t financially possible. So I  agreed to start IOP after a family holiday/getting necessary medical  assessments completed. After being in IOP for just over 5-5.5 weeks my  health insurance said that I was “weight stable” and “did not physically  need to be in ED specific treatment” so I was unable to finish the  program. A few months later I had reached a sort of stand still or  “psuedo recovery” and was released from the Emily Program all together. 

I tried to continue recovery on my own. I really did. I thought I was  doing okay. But I’m not. I finally found out what my weight actually  was (I wasn’t weighing myself) and I’m just concerned. I’ve tried  contacting the only two other ED specialists in the area and one is out  of pocket (I can’t afford) until she is qualified by insurance after  moving to a private practice. And the other isn’t taking new patients.  I’m nervous about going back to the Emily Program as my insurance  company is really against them paying for it and my family has to pay  for the dietitian out of pocket which is hard for them. 

I’m scared. I’m really scared. I don’t know what will happen if I  don’t find help. If anyone has been in a similar situation, had issues  with insurance, know of any other resources, etc, please let me know!

762,ah41ef,Request: Cant Kick My Weed Habit Without Sliding Backwards In My Eating Habits," 

Looking for advice really. Was hospitalised as a teen for anorexia, but now at the lower end of the 'healthy' weight for my height. Haven't purged in years and generally I deal with things a lot better than I used to.

I started smoking a lot of weed when first in recovery to help with both appetite and overwhelming feelings and a decade later (now 27) I'm still a heavy smoker. I don't want to smoke any more, it's hard enough to find motivation without a permanent fog in my head, so I tried to go cold turkey.

I've found this basically impossible though. Immediately I couldn't eat or sleep. After 5 days of begging with myself and forcing in every mouthful I cracked and had a smoke, swiftly followed by my first full-on binge in 3 years. I have zero appetite (and poor self esteem) sober and I really don't want to fall down the rabbit hole again, but I'm also desperate to kick my THC dependency. I've approached my doctor about referral to an addiction support service, but the waiting list is several months.

Does anyone have any advice for me? Trying to smoke as little as possible currently, but how quickly I went from mostly-alright to totally-not-alright scared me and I'm incredibly disappointed in myself because I thought I'd come a lot further than I really have in my recovery.

For the last 6 months, I haven't really had any issues with food other than the occasional binge. Unfortunately, I've recently gained a lot of weight over the holidays from binge eating. I went from a healthy weight to an unhealthy one and I know to some thats nothing, but to me, its a lot (I'm 5'3 by the way).

However, I started to get discouraged because I was eating a healthy caloric diet and have only lost a small amount of pounds. Yes, I have been eating the right things. I'm trying to keep in mind that I also gained a lot of muscle.

I promised myself I wouldn't go diet crazy. I promised myself being healthy and fit wouldn't get out of hand like it always does.

It has 20-40m delay, and lasts 2-3h. I can't tell if it's related to what I eat, and eating less only makes it slightly weaker and last less. I do not have negative feelings about eating itself, but there it is.

For reference, I do struggle with other mental health issues, but I have never had that much of a disorder surrounding food - my appetite was always very low, and after a severe illness in 2014, I went well into the underweight territory, and my appetite kinda never caught up. I have managed to go up to a healthier weight since, but at some point realized that, almost invariably, I feel really depressed while digesting, and there is nothing I can do to stop it.

It always passes, and I have no negative thoughts about food, and I've tried eating less at a time, but it did not help, it makes the effect lighter, but doesn't eliminate it. Regardless, I am at something of a loss, this ""effect"" is the biggest cause of my misery right now, and while I have a potential theory about psychological basis of it, it seems extremely unlikely.

Could this be caused by low testosterone(I have all symptoms, will be seeing an endo soon)? Or is there something else behind it?

Like, a lot of YouTubers who are in recovery talk about the multiple treatment centers they’ve been to, counseling, meal plans, multiple doctors or hospitals etc and they’re all like under or around the age of 20. So, this disorder has been “proven” though that. Me, on the other hand, doesn’t have that history and therefore I feel like I’m faking having a ED. Like I’ve been underweight and have restricted for years and my doctor has always ignored it. That makes me feel like I’m obviously not in any danger and am faking this. I’m faking the dizzy spells/ guilt/ over exercising/ calorie and food restrictions and rules because some sick part of me wants to be sick. I’m 21 and have only been to therapy a few times for depression. I’m not sure if this makes any sense- but I’m just so confused. If I really had a problem all these years I feel like people would have noticed earlier and not just ignored it, so therefore I am just a “wannaberexic”

summary: I haven’t been diagnosed/ treated/ noticed for my ED like a lot of other sufferers so I feel like I faking this illness for attention or something sick.

Am I faking, or is this real?

778,akitpk,Request: Seeking Help For Someone With An ED And Depression,"So I'm seeking advice for what this person, let's call her Anon. Anon is a middle school student who lives with her two parents and is a dependent. Has bulimia, is meeting psychiatrists and family therapy (I know from talking to the parents) but is getting worse. The parents actually are making the problem worse, as they were told to watch over her and prevent her from both binge and purge. And Anon hates being watched by her parents and it's a source of constant stress and argument. Her parents have approached me since I'm a close family friend and asked me to talk to her. I'm a couple hours away in college. I am a neuroscience major and have taken psych classes, so I have knowledge about ED but I am definitely not a psychiatrist.

This is a short conversation over text, paraphrased parts are in parenthesis. I'm asking the questions and she's answering. 

Q (Do you want to improve your situation?) Why (do you feel) is death the only option? 

A Because that's what I want but I know I don't deserve it (a way out). 

Q Why? 

A Because it's too good for me. I know I deserve to suffer here but I'm weak and I don't know what to do.

With this mindset, I feel that I cannot really help her without first having her acknowledge her problem and be willing to seek help. I asked about what she feels about leaving the household, me talking to her parents, me talking to her psychiatrists, and all she responds with is that she does not know what to do and that she does not deserve help.",1548642308,1/27/2019 20:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/akitpk/request_seeking_help_for_someone_with_an_ed_and/,4

I thought it was super triggering when she mentioned that because now I feel like I need to lose weight instead of focus on recovery and the apples thing just sounded like really naive advice since restricting my sweets to fruits only kind of lead me to developing bulimia. I want to get help and I really want to get over this but I’m kind of scared of not being able to find someone who will be able to help me since this woman was recommended as a counselor for eating disorders.

So I throw up because I feel better afterward, not to lose weight. I don’t binge and purge. I just feel better after throwing up. So I don’t think I’m bulimic, my friend disagrees and says that me throwing up every time I eat is absolutely bulimia.

It’s been 9 years since the worst of my ED/orthopedist. At the worse I obsessively calorie counted and exercised, which would flip flop into binge cycles. It lasted about... 3 years?

I had a period of calm but then I was lucky enough to birth the most wonderful babies on the planet (I edited out “beautiful” because I’m trying my hardest not to unconsciously suck them into my bullshit.) Unfortunately, it has wreaked havoc on my body dysmorphia.

I tried to go at it “smart,” just get into some fitness apps and some “safe” diets. Hahaha! After two months I could feel myself slipping into dangerous waters.

Objectively, I know what I would tell my daughter if she was in this position (I pray she never, ever is, another reason I want to nip this in the bud), but it’s so hard to tell my inner critic. Never thin enough, always looking at food like a trap. Constantly poking and prodding myself in the mirror.

I’ve cut the triggering habits like apps and fitness forums, cut way down on pressuring myself to eat or exercise a certain way. But I can’t stop the voice in my head that’s constantly grading me, whispering to me to put xxx food away, or to go ahead and cram it all in my face cause it’s a lost cause anyway.

Yes, I’ve been to therapy before, it’s not practical just this moment because I just quit my toxic job (and it’s sexy health insurance) and logistically it’s tight. Yes, I have considered online therapy and will probably pursue it once I can get my new work situation in order.

Can anyone offer advice?",1548413791,1/25/2019 4:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ajnx4l/request_im_afraid_im_relapsing_due_to_difficulty/,10
788,ajnwl5,Request: how To Beat Sugar As A Coping Mechanism?,"have had anxiety disorder and OCD since childhood. I use sugar to comfort myself when I'm having one of my regular anxiety attacks. I will buy 8 slices of fancy dessert at a bakery on the corner, walk home with them in my bag, and eat them all in 10 minutes, tuffing them down my throat, barely tasting anything, feeling zero pleasure and only stomach pain. (I don't throw it up.)

I have a bad relationship with food. On a daily basis, all I eat is fresh spaghetti &amp; tomato sauce with premium parmesan cheese. Every meal, every day. It causes me alot of anxiety to prepare food at home, and prepared food is made by strangers with unknown quality ingredients &amp; that freaks me out.

I know I need medication for my OCD and my anxiety, but I don't trust it at all. My brother needed serious drugs for mood disorders as well as a chronic illness and he's gone through such bad side effects for years. Witnessing him going through that, and seeing how little real effect those drugs had, and seeing how he &amp; others rely on them - has made me completely put off medication.

I hate writing ""feelings"" out. I'm not a writer. All these books about emotional eating are all about writing ""feelings"". I can't be dealing with that. I have an addiction - you can't ""feelings"" your way out of a heroin addiction, it hasn't worked for me. Counselling is bullshit. They are trained in body image eating disorders, not emotional eating disorders, and I'd rather take the hard earned money from my $10/hr job on rent not a therapist's Porsche. They don't know what they're facing when they talk to me. They don't know what they're talking about.

This is more of a situational problem, my emotional problems are just what they are. I need to move into my own apartment. Currently I live in a space with 4 roommates - I can't possibly cook when the kitchen is occupied by anybody but me. Even with my bedroom door closed, the presence of other people in the house ratchets up my anxiety. But I can't move out because a bachelor apartment is triple what I can afford. (miraculously get a better job? i have academic problems, I couldn't get a college diploma though I've tried 3 different programs)

I'm hoping that I find a life partner who enjoys cooking good food so they can introduce better meals in my life. But I'm afraid of dating right now because I'm worried that my eating habits will scare people away.

I'm scared that I'm going to die. I'm going to eat myself to death.

Ive tried switching from desserts to healthier sweets, like dried fruit, stevia-sweetened snacks, or protein bars. But it's not the same, my brain knows the difference &amp; screams at me &amp; I go get my cake, cheesecake, brownies, bars, and tarts and binge.

I got told that I’m becoming too skinny but I never saw that except in pictures. Yet I wanted more because when i look at myself in the mirror i still myself as a fat guy.

Now i’m not sure if i have an eating disorder or not. But what i’m currently struggling with is the fact that I had decided to up my calorie intake so i’d be more healthy as it got to a point where i’d be dizzy all day and feel as if i’m going to faint.

So, we would greatly appreciate your input on this. We've developed a [survey](https://goo.gl/forms/t9jvBy5bJzwT1cGv2) to gather some data, please help us out and fill it out? It will take roughly 5 minutes.

She’s barely taller than me  and I’m less than half her weight. She makes me feel fat. Not  appearance wise, but eating habits wise. I’m trying to recover here by  eating enough food, but she’s out there with no hesitation, talking  about how she hasn’t eaten in X days, how she only ate this and that,  how she’s trying not to eat... It’s really triggering to hear,  especially since you’re already struggling to get out of those  behaviours. I barely talk outside of home anymore, so no one’s really  aware of my struggles and I haven’t asked her about the topic in case  it’s too sensitive. It’s possible she may also be struggling from an  eating disorder, but another thing that’s stopping me from talking to  her about the subject is because of how much she lies. She’s lied about  her sexuality, relationships, made-up friends, about me, etc. I don’t  know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

f she really does have an eating disorder and I stay  quiet, what’s going to happen to her? If she’s only lying about her  behaviours and I speak up, how embarrassing would it be? I don’t trust  her and I’m seriously considering taking a break or something from her  for many reasons (bad influence, almost everything negative of what  comes out of her mouth, shushes me whenever I open my mouth even though I  barely even talk, and just being uncomfortable around her presence). On  the other hand, I wouldn’t have any other close friends if I drop her.  My only other close friend is the one she considers her “best” friend...  I’m so indecisive.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a 16 year old eating disorder (strictly non-purging anorexia) schizoaffective (bipolar 2 subtype), severe depression, anxiety, and OCD. I’m currently in a serious relapse with my ED and my weight is way down.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I was (am) fairly suicidal. I only told one person. She met me with compassion and understanding. She provided me amazing nonjudgmental support when I shared my feelings. She also is supportive (in a helpful way) of my attempts at recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

However, then a group of my other friends noticed I wasn’t doing too hot, and then figured out how hard I was struggling and decided to throw me an intervention; alone, three inexperienced women who know nothing about mental illness, and no professional insight or support.

&amp;#x200B;

They sat me down and berated me for an hour and a half. That I’m bad for not opening up to them. They’re mad that I’m still struggling. I should be getting better faster. I’m not doing enough to help myself. I should have reached out to them first.

&amp;#x200B;

Like.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Truly depressed people with mental illness on the verge of suicide seldom reach out. So don’t get fucking OFFENDED when you find out I didn’t tell you. Maybe you should feel like..what could I have done better for D to trust us? They NEVER text me first. Ever. So why would i share my suicidal ideation with them??

&amp;#x200B;

2. Recovery isn’t a straight line and nobody’s fucking perfect. Yeah, I’ve been struggling consistently for about a year, but like..it’s not my FAULT. I have multiple mental illnesses and they all aggravate the others. It’s out of my god damn control.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Don’t berate the person you’re trying to “support.” Beating down on someone (with no moderator!!) will, in fact, make whatever the bigger issue is, worse.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Don’t pretend you know what you’re doing!! The first thing one of them said was, “so we’ve never done this, and we have no idea what we’re doing, but here goes!” Interventions are DANGEROUS if not done correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Have a fucking goal at least!! They didn’t even have a desired outcome of the intervention. They had no plan. No follow through. I don’t even know what they expected from me. I think they just wanted me to agree with them, apologize for not telling them, and then listen to their every piece of advice and treat it like it was made of gold.

&amp;#x200B;

6. They told me that my therapist must be really bad. They said I needed to fire her and find someone new. Or see two therapists. Which is SOOOOOOOOOOOO unethical to each therapist! No better way to get two sets of instructions and accidentally fuck it up. (For me anyway)

&amp;#x200B;

7. Do not EVER tell someone who is suicidal your personal stories of loss. Jesus Christ. Really?? I want to die and you’re GUILTING ME? Fuck dude really? My best friend passed from suicide in 2012. I’m still fucking demolished over it, not to mention the three other friends who have gone that way. I do NOT need to be told about the affects of suicide on friends and family. I’ve experienced more loss via suicide than all three of them together. So don’t fucking give me the guilt trip.

&amp;#x200B;

They literally had no clue what they were doing. And for some reason i just sat there and took it. Before the intervention they said that if I don’t do it they won’t hang out with me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Then here we are two days later and one of them tells me I’m toxic and that she doesn’t want to know me anymore. UH OKAY. So fucking traumatize me, berate me, make me feel worthless, then bail out.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. Gotcha.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am now, picking up the fucking pieces. Glad there was a point to all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and my boyfriend told me he didn’t love me anymore last week. By text. While I was working.

&amp;#x200B;

I seriously have never felt more worthless in my life. I feel like an absolutely waste of space. I’m obviously “too much” for people that they want to get away from me.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s been a hell of a week and my mental state is much worse than it was before Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

Im struggling harder with food right now than I have in a long time. Between my boyfriend dumping me, my friends abandoning me because I won’t listen to their uninformed advice, and my job sucking, I’m not doing a very successful job at staying healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

I WILL say that through this whole month, I haven’t caved and self harmed. It’s been almost 4 years since I last did it, and apparently men or shorty friends won’t bring me down that far!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this was a pointless post, and I’m sorry. But I figured you all might know how I’m feeling and may have some solid advice or words for me. Have any of you all been given an “intervention” before? How did you handle it?

&amp;#x200B;

800,anlxs7,Request: dealing with a binge/restrict cycle,"So I have never liked my body. I've always struggled with having a little extra fat around my stomach and hips. I remember I would always try new diets or to exercise intensely for a bit until my depression kicked in and I felt defeated after seeing no results. This cycle continues today. On top of that, I stress eat, so when the depression kicks in, I self sabotage myself by indulging in whatever food I can find. I tried purging in the past but never got anywhere. It wasn't until last week that I was finally successful. Even though it's only been a week of purging, I feel as though I had an EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified) before this. 

Another issue I have, which may be more related to the LGBTQ+ community, is that I feel very dysphoric about my chest. One method of binding successfully is losing weight. So I've been  obsessed with trying to lose weight my whole life. But I keep getting stuck in the cycle of avoiding food for a bit until I give in and binge eat and then I either hate myself and get depressed or I'll panic and purge or self harm. 

Does anyone relate to this constant spiral? I don't know how to cope with it because food is all around me and I feel like it controls my thoughts.",1549420386,2/5/2019 20:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/anlxs7/request_dealing_with_a_bingerestrict_cycle/,10

802,anlwg3,Request: should I seek professional help or try to recover without it?," 

When I was in high school I had OCD centered around food and I made myself very sick restricting. With the help of a team of medical professionals, I was able to recover by about 80%, and I spent about 4 years with noticeably unusual but not harmful eating habits, and a stable weight. However, for the past year and a half I’ve fallen into cycles of restricting and binging, with my weight yo-yoing, and constant bloating. At one point I decided I was going to kick this thing once and for all but I was only able to sustain healthy habits for 3 months. What’s different from my experience in high school is that I’m obsessed with my weight and appearance now, and I didn’t have this desire to binge. Currently I’m eating less than the recommended calories and I’m a bit underweight. I think I’m starting to feel some of the physical effects of malnutrition. I’m 21 and finishing college and I don’t want the rest of my life to be like this!

803,anhndz,Request: I'm Bulimic And My Crush Made A Comment About My Weight.," 

For the past 6 months I've been really struggling with my bulimia, over-exercising and restricting. Since September my weight has been fluctuating quite drastically and so I've been incredibly sad when I've lost weight through restricting/over-exercising only to then binge for weeks on end and put all the weight back on (and more).

Anyway, back in October I (I'm f21 btw) sent her a photo of my newly toned and sculpted body from working as a arborist and she loved it and let me know it quite a bit. We also know we both like the other but there's reasons why we can't be together so it's a real ""it's complicated"" situation for us. Fast-forward to now and I'm no longer the girl in that picture, I'm quite a few kilos heavier (I'm glad we're not allowed to mention numbers because I'm too ashamed to). We got pretty intimate just before Christmas and I had mentioned that I was fat and I needed to lose weight - she replied with, ""Oh my god, no, you're not fat at all, not even close - stop talking shit"". And in a sense she's right, I'm still well and truly in the healthy BMI range.

So, 4 days ago I was at the gym lifting weights and I had told her that I was there doing so and that I'd moved up to heavier weights. And I was joking around by saying how I shouldn't have had all those burgers and sour worms in the last few months because I'm paying for it all now by working out everyday for 3 hours. She replied by sending me that photo I sent to her in October and said, ""If you run into this toned bitch can you let her know to hit me up pls and thanks"". Now she was definitely joking, like we were messing around, I know she means no genuine harm at all - we are often very sarcastic and have quite the dry sense of humour with each other.

Now I've never cared about what people said about my weight in the past, I was a very overweight teenager - hurtful comments from my dad or family members never bothered me. But I have never had a comment per se from a friend before, let alone someone I'm intimately involved with. It also doesn't help that she's quite slim and small framed. She's like that hot girl on the soccer team (which is actually true in my case, we're on the same soccer team) that everyone drools over and wants to be with - so that doesn't help things for me either because I feel so out of her league and unworthy. So ever since she said that I haven't eaten, it's been just over 4 days and I can't even look at food, can't stand the smell, everything about it - just, nope. Even my most favourite food I can't stand. Cucumbers or Big Macs - I can't stand either, any food is just pure evil to me at the moment. The scary thing for me is that I have NEVER felt this way towards food before - I've always been an emotional eater so this is very very new territory for me. I feel no urges to binge and no craving. I've had issues with other mental health problems in the past but I don't think I've truly hated myself (and my body) until now - this is pure disgust and I just can't understand how something - a sarcastic joke - got to me. Nothing ever gets to me - rarely anyone is able to penetrate the walls of my mind and yet someone has - with something so (in my eyes) minor.

I've still been going to the gym too for about 2 hours - running or cycling or both, no weights. I just live off black coffee and water, I don't even put sweetener in my coffee anymore (because in general I hate coffee - I just use it for caffeine purposes). I don't know what to do - should I talk to her about it? Or should I leave it? But if I do, I don't wanna come off as weak - as someone who can't take a joke.

Idk, I give up :(",1549394659,2/5/2019 13:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/anhndz/request_im_bulimic_and_my_crush_made_a_comment/,11

Ok so... I know this might seem little ridiculous to some people, I know some people here starve themselves or other things and I might sound really dumb complaining about this, but I really dont know where else do go and ask for help. I have serious, serious chocolate addiction that is fucking up my life and possibly my health. I have literally no, NO self control. I always liked chocolate but past several years and months it has gotten so much worse. I eat 2 chocolate bars (or equivalent of) a day. If I get chocolate bar, I will eat it in maybe 10-15 minutes. The other day I bought that BIG big bar of chocolate because it was on sale and I ate it in a day. I eat this ammount literally every single day. Chocolate just gives me happiness. I feel so good, for a little while... Today I had one of the worst toilet sessions EVER. I had such a stomach cramps (because of the fact that past two days I literally just ate chocolate and cereal, nothing else) I literally thought I will die. It was so bad. And I always do this, I go through this cycle: eat chocolate so much, get extremely sick, swear I will never do it again, forget how bad I felt, have urge and eat it again, REPEAT. I just dont know what to do. I just honestly cant stop. I tried some time without chocolate but it was just days and then I always get back to it. My biggest achievment was about months of very healthy eating, no chocolate what so ever - then I got big pack of chocolates on sale and I was like ""well I can have one piece a day and it will last long time"".... Then I had some. The whole package. And another one, and another one... and there went the healthy eating, I was back in the cyrcle. I really worry what affect this will have on my health. I cant be good for anyone to consume this amount of chocolate daily... :( I do have depression but I am on pills and honestly dont feel too depressed these days (year or two its better). So I dont think I am necessarily eating my feelings away, its more like chocolate is honestly this thing that gives me this comfort nothing else does. I dont even have otherwise addictive personality - I dont smoke, drink, I'm not addicted to anything else.

I just dont know what to do, because it seems like such stupid problem to me in the great scheme of things. There are people dying of alcohol addiction, so who is gonna take me seriously with my ""chocolate problem""? Its not like I can walk into rehab for it... its everywhere. In every store, in every supermarket, I just cant get away from it... :(

(I check my health often because I'm vegetarian and I am not deficient in any important minerals or nutrients. I have hypothyroid disorder but have been taking pills for it for ages and the levels are ok on that as well...)

I notice that I binge eat when I am...

1. Stressed or emotional (I feel better when I eat junks)
2. I eaten a “bad” meal and just say “fuck it” and eat more
3. When I am not going to let anyone see my naked body for awhile

90% of the time, I’ll throw up when I have one of these episodes and I don’t want to continue this anymore.

Any women who have encountered the same situations or eating disorder? I really want to move forward and not feel guilty when having an episode of binge eating.

About two months ago I finally decided to fight back. Between Dec and a few weeks ago, I only bped a couple of times -- a major accomplishment for me, my first extended period ever.

However, a few weeks ago I got alcohol poisoning and got really sick physically. That somehow triggered me and my bping is now the worst it's ever been. I feel completely out of control.

I struggled with a pretty bad restriction and binge/purge disorder for a full year after high school. I lost a lot in a few months and my weight plateaued after that. I’ve recovered fairly well after comming out about it to my boyfriend and his sister. I’m eating normally and fairly healthily now and I’ve started gaining weight.

I was never “anorexic” looking. I only ever looked “healthy and trim” as my family put it. But now I’m gaining weight again and my anxiety about regaining the lost weight is scaring me to death.

I live with my boyfriends family now and his sister has also struggled with eating disorders. Despite that she has nothing but bad things to say about her body and she is VERY thin! She talks about her thighs and belly and constantly talks about how fat she feels. And here I am on the slightly heavier side gaining back weight feeling obese compared to her.

812,am8ge3,Request: Are These Warning Signs Of An Eating Disorder?," I just recently graduated high school. In my high school years I was a bit overweight, but my senior year it got too much for me to handle. I decided in June of 2018 to start a very popular fad diet that surfaced mainstream media around 2016 and only gets more attention everyday.   I was able to lose a significant amount of weight at a seemingly reasonable pace but I started noticing I was very strict with myself. The diet itself is very strict. Once you fall off you gain a lot of weight back and become bloated in your face and stomach and your bowels hate you. I started constantly checking nutrition facts and obsessed over places my friends and family would eat out, knowing I wouldn’t eat there. I started (unhealthily) intermittent fasting, which lead to OMAD (one meal a day). Some people swear it’s healthy, but I was only eating 1/4 of my normal calorie intake by doing this because I was very restrictive on my foods. If I craved a food I labeled “unhealthy” I would chew it up and spit it out, because in my head as long as I didn’t swallow and throw it up, it was okay (this being my most common habit, occurring daily). I started smelling foods if I was hungry and feed off of the scent. 

&amp;#x200B;

It’s gotten to a point where I’m completely terrified to go off this dumb fad diet.   A lot of people see benefits from it, but I think it’s given me orthorexia. I would tell my parents and siblings that I think I had early signs of an eating disorder, reiterating my fear of all carbs, sugars, fruits, processed products, etc. My family just said it was me finally being healthy. It’s weird because this same fad diet has only fed into my dads binge eating disorder. So when he told me I was being healthy, I thought, he must really know! He has an ED himself, I trust his wisdom.   I don’t want to be disrespectful to this ED community, as I know it’s hard because I myself am a binge eating recoverer. But I feel that my habits aren’t healthy? If I feel I’ve eaten too many carbs for the day I won’t eat the next day. If my stomach feels weird I won’t eat the next day. If my face looks fuller I won’t eat the next day. All these habits are encouraged in the diet as a natural detox. I feel so ignorant and confused. I don’t know if I’m being safe with my body or not but I’m too scared to stop. I don’t want weight regain and I’m still trying to lose weight, so I just continue on since the diet has given me results. I’ve read that diets and heavy restricting cause orthorexia and other eating disorders.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don’t know if I’m being paranoid or not. I understand its not as extreme as others who suffer from eating disorders but I’m scared it may get to a point where it will be and I’m trying to prevent that from happening as best I can.

Hey there! I know this question is rather different than the rest, but hopefully you can stick with me while I explain.

I run a blog that has over 56k followers; to be vague, it involves writing. It's impossible to keep track of every single follower with that total, but lately I've been noticing multiple people following my blog that post various pro ED content, like thinspo, extremely low calorie recipes, and so on.

It worries me to see these things, especially from young people on the internet. This is how I was exposed to these ideas when I was that age that led to some very dangerous behaviors.

So, with these 56k+ followers, I'm wondering if there is anything I should (or can) say as a general announcement or message to sort of let them know that EDs are a serious matter, that people do care, there is help to be had, and this is not something to be taken so lightly.

Is there anything I can or should do? I want to help, and right now I feel like I'm witnessing a crime and doing nothing to stop it. This is a delicate matter, and as much as I don't want to stay silent about it, I almost think it would be better to say nothing than risk saying the wrong thing. I don't care if people unfollow me, but I do care if I were to push someone further into the ED void.

tl;dr - How can I use my blog with 56k+ followers, more and more of which are pro ED blogs, to raise awareness about the dangers of EDs?

819,apf16z,Request: Advice for boyfriend of girl with anorexia," 

Hey people of reddit. I’m desperate for advice...

My girlfriend of a little under a year is going through a really tough time right now and I’m not sure what to do.

Her therapist, her doctor, and a few of her friends and family have all shown concern about her eating habits. We have all made attempts to talk to her about it but she shuts down and gets extremely defensive and denies the possibility of an eating disorder. For a while, I have just been by her side comforting her and being as supportive as humanly possible.

The past few weeks she’s gone to her therapist and come home extremely upset. I would ask her if it was something she wanted to talk about or something she just wanted to just be left alone. When she would talk to me about it, it was always because her therapist would begin asking her about her eating and talk to her about developing a good relationship with food, etc. she would always follow up with something along the lines of, “this is ridiculous! I don’t have an eating disorder! I can eat a lot of food when I want to! She just sounds exactly like my grandparents.”

She will eat one or maybe two “meals” a day. These meals are usually a cup of yogurt with granola or some rice with cheese, tomatoes, and black beans.... which is one of the best meals she eats. 

She is very skinny. Unhealthily skinny. She still has a rather regular mensural cycle which I see as a good sign, but recently her kidneys and digestive tract have been giving her trouble along with extreme fatigue and regular depression.

I have been standing by as the supportive boyfriend, but now she is threatening to stop seeing her therapist and psychiatrist because they are “trying to tell her she has something she doesn’t.” She’s underweight and still dropping weight. I really really want to know if there’s a good way to help her come around and open up to the possibility of her having an eating disorder so she can actually start getting better.

She has always been concerned about her weight and always talks about how she wants to gain weight because she knows she’s not healthy. She will do good for a few days, then go a few days eating one meal or not eating at all because she says she just forgot or it wasn’t convenient. She gets down on herself, then she won’t eat because she says she’s so down that she’s not hungry.

I’m just really worried and at my wits end. Any advice is welcome.

To be clear, I am very careful NEVER to tell her to eat, tell her she should eat, tell her she is too skinny, or anything of the sort. I am sure to always tell her she will get to where she wants to be, she can do it, tell her she’s doing great when she has good days and reassure her that she is strong enough to get through the bad days.

When I make food for myself, I always make enough for her and offer it to her in a non suggestive way and never get on her when she turns it down.

TL;DR

Girlfriends therapist, doctor, and some family/friends have all shown concern about her eating habits but she is in complete denial. She is now beginning to suffer extreme health consequences because of her eating habits and still won’t come around to the thought of an eating disorder. She eats  very little. She is underweight. Diagnosed depression/anxiety, ADHD. Is threatening to leave her therapist because she is showing concern for her eating.

A few months ago, I cut a very close friend out of my life pernantly, cold turkey, because of disgusting things they said about certain people's performance at college.

These words have echoed in my brain since, and for whatever reason, they're transcending into my old ED habits. I'm currently a healthy weight, but before college was an unhealthy weight and really struggled with food for various reasons. I'm in my final semester of undergrad, and I can't afford to slip into old habits now.

I know this has materialised because of my mental health (I have depression and anxiety) and subconsciously I KNOW this is a bad way to deal with things but it's all I know to 'deal' with situations I can't logically and mentally handle.

How can I think outside of this way of dealing with stressful/hurtful issues?

When i was a child, i ate everything without any drama. But things changed and i don't know why. I began to find certain food disgusting to look at and i hated the smell. That disgust grew over the years.

I can't eat vegetables of any sort. If i take a bite, i immediately have to gag. This gagging intensifies the longer i try to chew on it, leading to throwing up or spitting the food out again. I can eat apples and bananas, but those are the only fruits i am able to eat properly.

I have been made fun of when i had trouble eating, so i get embarrassed by myself everytime i try to eat sth new and have to gag.

I mostly eat pizza and fries and things like that, and i know that this can't be healthy. I can't try new things though, because i can't control the gagging.

Does anybody relate? I have been searching on the internet for a long time, but i can't find anything.

But she got back tonight and she texted me “hey, what happened to the bathroom?”. And it dawned upon me what I had done... I forgot to hide my mess.

I’m feeling so ashamed right now. I sent my roommate a lengthy text apologizing for my disorder. And she said it was okay, I shouldn’t apologize and that if I ever needed support, she would be there.

But I know that’s just a nice respond. Who actually wants to share a room with a bulimic girl? No one. It’s disgusting and gross and I’m a mess. I feel so embarrassed. I hate myself right now. I know she’s a clean a clean freak so that fact that I’ve been vomiting in her toilet must be such a disturbing thing to find out.

829,aonn91,"Request: I have reached a healthy weight, but I am still binging and I am terrified"," 

Hi everyone,

last December I have had a very bad anorexia relapse, also because I was alone abroad for the first time in my life, without no one watching me. My weight plummeted to extremely unhealthy levels.

Then, from December onwards, things changed, the hunger kicked in and I gained basically all the weight back through massive binges.

At first I told myself that I needed to gain weight anyways, so it wasn't that big of a deal. But right now it's been a couple of weeks since I've entered the healthy BMI range and I still keep on binging. My binges keep on being absurdly massive - we're talking three days worth of food in less than two hours. Then I freak out and panic completely restrict heavily the following day, then end up overly hungry and binge again. I don't have any specific hour or trigger when binge happen; sometimes I wake up overly hungry in the morning and binge right after having left the bed, sometimes it's in the middle of the afternoon, sometimes (very rarely) it's late in the evening like today.

I had eaten X calories (with X being around half of what I'd need, but basically around double of what my Anorexia feels comfortable with) and I felt great. But then, after dinner, I felt the sudden urge to just go out and get food. And I did it. I binged again, eating other X calories three times. I am now sitting on my chair with a slight discomfort on my belly and a very, very, very powerful feeling of being horrible, fat, gross, horrible, fat, gross. My belly is huge, my legs are huge, I am all huge. I am completely, utterly, incontrollably TERRIFIED. I just want to cry, scream, run away. The only thing I can think of right now is: you will never ever stop, it's never going to get better, you will eat and eat and eat until you will be obese and more than obese and then you will eat yourself to death.

What saddens me the most is that before my ED I was already an adult and I was skinny. I effortlessly managed to maintain a BMI which is only slightly higher than where I am now. Yet I can't seem to be able to do it anymore. I don't know what's broken in me. I feel hopeless.

I don't have any support. I am abroad, meaning that I can't talk with my old therapist back home. I also can't find a new one here because I can't afford it and in less than a month I will move to another city so it wouldn't make sense anyways. I have a meal plan my dietitian wrote some time ago but that was when I was underweight, so it's not applicable at my situation now as I don't have and don't want to gain any more weight.

I don't know if someone has ever experienced this. I feel so bad, like really bad. Really, truly, terribly bad.

So today my therapist and I (24F) were talking about my eating disorder and how I’m going to start seeing a nutritionist soon. I expressed anxiety though about the fact that my ED doesn’t really feel real cause we’ve never talked about it in terms of a specific label, just in terms of my behaviors. My therapist suggested we go through the criteria of different EDs together and see what we agree on based on my symptoms.

My therapist at the end said that based on the criteria we went through, she thinks I meet all the criteria for anorexia nervosa. I was floored cause while I definitely restrict a lot and am terrified of weight gain, I’m technically a healthy BMI, but she said she thinks I’m maintaining a low weight relative to my natural body weight based on 1) the amount of weight I’ve lost in a short period of time (which is admittedly a lot) and 2) my physical symptoms (get my period very rarely, am always freezing cold, fingernails are kinda blue, often dizzy).

I don’t know what to think. One the one hand, she is the professional here, but on the other hand my ED voice is now really strong in telling me I’m ‘cheating’ somehow to get diagnosed with anorexia without being at an underweight BMI.

833,aohoki,Request: Talking To A Parent With A History Of ED," 

My mother in the past had bulimia and recovered. She is very focused on eating healthy food. I currently live far away and visit when I can.

When I searched the subreddit for parents with ED the post that came up was about dealing with an ED when a parent was also a sufferer; I am asking about how to talk to her as a non ED haver.

She often tends to talk about how gross a food is if she thinks it’s unhealthy or too large a portion. She will also do things like make a big deal about saying how stuffed she is and how much food she’s eaten after a moderate portion, or talk about how she’s only eaten salad/healthy things (in my past experience she tends to not mention snacks).

I don’t know how to respond to such statements when I see her in a good way. I try to be understanding but when I was younger she could be pushy about food (nagging me to take a third helping at dinner when I was full on one had, telling me to have an apple rather that a piece of bread as a snack on the other) and I tend to get annoyed and lose my patience when I feel that she is judging or trying to control my eating.

Additionally, I have been trying to lose weight (I am obese) and while she’s been encouraging, I am worried about whether it is OK to talk to her about it since I have been getting into intermittent and (short) extended fasting which I’ve heard can be triggering to people who have recovered from EDs.

I started being restrictive about my food intake when I was around 11 wherein I only ate proper meals during the weekend and then most of the time vomit them, and then procees to not eat or eat only some snacks(e. g. a cracker, a bag of chips, etc.) on weekdays and then burn it all off via dancing. I dont exactly remember the reason why i started doing it, but I do remember feeling very lonely and not really belonging anywhere during those times. Did that for about a year and then grew out of it but when I turned 15, my eating habits became out of whack again and I also always felt the need to lose weight. i wasnt even over wight. then when i was 16, this became even worse as i developed anxiety disorders and couldn't even bear to eat most of the times due to my anxiousness. I got through with that, but then came the binging. For the most part of my 11th grade, i binged and binged and gained so much weight. for the first time in my life, i became overweight. i would hide food and then eat it when everyone is asleep, or eat during my commute home where i know no one will recognize or remember me. but then in 12th grade, i started dieting and lost all the weight that i gained through eating keto, but then that quickly turned into a very restrictive eating as i would always convince myself to eat less than what i should on keto, sometimes even eating one meal a day only. i was also obsessing with workouts and would do calorie burning workouts most of the nights when everyone was asleep. i stopped doing keto and switched to intermittent fasting but that also turned restrictive as i would always find ways to reduce my caloric intake. i would also obsess over how i look and all the fats in my body and with how i weigh even though people around me say that im already fine with the way i looked. it just never seemed enough. that turned into a cycle or restrict-binge-purge. it stopped for a while when we went on vacation but when we came back, i felt like i needed to lose weight because i gained some on vacation. that turned again into eating only during on weekends and drinking water only on weekdays, all the while dancing for at least 4 hrs. a day. when i started freshman year, it became worse but then m friend would always nag me for not eating so now, when i do eat, it turns into a full on binge which i would purge. its affected me so much already that i nearly failed a class because i would always be in the bathroom purging during class hours instead of actually attending.

Now, im on a carnivore diet because i saw that it can help lose weight (why is there such a need to always lose more 😔) but i just really want my life back. im always jealous of people around me here at university because they seem to not care about what they eat and their world doesnt revolve around calories, and macros, and nutritional infos and exercises and workouts.

839,asg0a7,Request: Counting calories again in recovery?," 

Hi guys,

I've been in recovery from anorexia/BED for about 6 years now, and  had been doing pretty well for the past 2 years or so. However,  recently, I've had some old negative thoughts start popping up and it's  causing me to be more restrictive with my food than I probably should  be. I'm still trying to eat intuitively but I don't think I'm eating  enough during the day, which is causing me to binge at night, which then  causes me to feel gross in the morning and want to restrict again (yall  know how it goes). 

So basically I think I need to start counting calories again just to  see what a reasonable amount of food actually is, since I think my  ""intuitive eating"" is leaning on the restrictive side. I'm just worried  because I know that counting calories can be a slippery slope, even if  it's for a ""healthy"" reason. Has anyone else had any experience with  this? Do you think it's possible to count calories in a non-disordered  way? I've set my daily goal to a normal number for someone of my weight  and height and activity etc. 

(Also I would rather not go to a dietician because I'm still on my  parents' insurance and I don't want them to know I'm struggling a little  bit right now... I'm hoping this is something I can handle myself.)

i was fine up until about  beginning of ninth grade when i would go in and out of periods of eating  so much it would hurt then being repulsed by the thought of eating.  soon after i began to purge, and it quickly became pretty frequent. even  if i haven’t eaten anything the urge to purge would consume me as soon  as i wake up and i had to force myself to puke. it hurts the worst in  the mornings. i was always thinking about the next time i could puke  especially after eating, even if the meals were a normal portion. i feel  so fat always. 

&amp;#x200B;

recently my dad asked if i wanted to go eat with him and  i said yes originally, but as i was getting dressed i looked in the  mirror and stared at my body. i felt so fat i couldn’t go out and eat  with him. i check all calories on all foods and drinks otherwise i  become so anxious. i can’t consume caloric drinks anymore. throughout  the school day i write the amount of calories I’ve eaten on my hand. the  idea of eating usually makes me nervous. food is what is on my mind  most of the time. sometimes when i eat meals that are considered a  normal portion, my mind spirals and hits the code red button and I  panic, consider it a binge, and puke. afterward im so shameful and  dizzy. it’s the worst and i feel horrible and self conscious all the  time about my body. 

some days are better than most but i just don’t know  what to do. Can anyone offer advice?",1550613521,2/19/2019 15:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/asfzxt/request_struggling_with_body_image_and_unhealthy/,1

She has a very defined sleep routine: She keeps her place dark and  quiet an hour or so before going to bed, turns off all electronics, goes  to bed really early (9pm), avoids caffeine.  Every night she falls  asleep for 2-3 hours, wakes up exhausted, and cant fall back to sleep  all night.  

She's tried CBD, low %THC, her old prescription for Benzos, herbal  stuff like teas and sleep pills, and nothing works.  Im worried, because  it has been weeks and doesnt seem to be getting better.

I'm not sure if my girlfriend has an eating disorder. She does not like eating whatsoever. That's related to body image issues. She doesn't want to get fat. She already thinks she eats too much, even though she barely eats more than 1-2 meals sometimes.

She also always gets nausea every time she eats. She feels sick. She never actually throws up, but she vomits in her mouth a lot. I'm not sure what eating disorder this could be or even if she has an eating disorder.

Can body dysmorphia make you appear smaller than you actually are?

I’ve been suffering from an eating disorder for the past 5 years. Originally anorexic, I now have behaviours which would be better described as EDNOS (or OSFED). I’ve realised within the past year that I have body dysmorphia, and was wondering if it could work the other way? As in, most of those w the disorder would describe it as seeing their body inaccurately - mainly seeing themselves as much bigger than they actually are. But can dysmorphia cause you to see yourself as smaller than you are as well? I’m aware that me even thinking this is probably the dysmorphia itself causing me to question it, but surely if it can cause my body to appear much bigger than it actually is, it could also cause the opposite?

Confused and would appreciate any thoughts!",1550458814,2/17/2019 21:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/arsfx0/request_can_body_dysmorphia_make_you_appear/,10

848,arsf5h,Request: I Don't Know If I Have An Eating Disorder," 

I don't know if I have an eating disorder. I know I have weight issues and issues with my body but I can't tell if I have an eating disorder or if everything I do is just the product of those. Any advice is tremendously appreciated especially as I can't afford to see my therapist and my doctor is booked months out.

There are a few specific things I've read of that concern me, but I don't know if they should or not. If I step on the scale my mood will be affected for the rest of the day based on whether I weigh more or less than last time i weighed. I go through periods of eating anything I see to eating nothing unless someone prepares something for me (I'd feel guilty turning them down). I can't eat anything without thinking of how many calories are in it. I think of most foods in terms of ""If I eat this, how much time do I need to run on the elliptical to burn it off?""

I've seen these and a few other things talked about as being parts of eating disorders. But there are a few things that confuse me and make me not sure. The first is the fact that I go through those periods of just eating everything, like whatever's driving me to not eat just disappears for a while. I would think an eating disorder would be all the time. Second, I'm completely afraid to say anything for sure about myself because I have a long history of *trying* to have something be wrong with me (pretending that I have asthma, ASPD, insomnia, etc. to the point of convincing myself it was real). At this point I don't know when something is actually wrong with me vs when I'm just being stupid and making something wrong. The only difference is that those lasted a few weeks, this cycle has lasted years which is why it concerns me more. With that, I'm afraid if I say anything to anyone they won't believe me either, because why would they trust me about it if I don't trust myself?

Again I have no idea what to think or what to do. If I do have some eating disorder, it doesn't seem to line up with any of them I've read about. I'm looking for any advice whatsoever (aside from ""see your doctor therapist"" cause I can't really rush those, they'll come when they can). I at least just want to know if I should be worried or not.",1550458667,2/17/2019 20:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/arsf5h/request_i_dont_know_if_i_have_an_eating_disorder/,1
849,arsen7,Request: I Think My Fasting Has Turned Into An Eating Disorder?," 

Sorry this post ended up really long and messy.

I'm a 23 year old male so not really the type that gets eating disorders so this is really embarrassing for me. I gained a lot of weight a year and a half ago, Since then i felt basically like a fat disgusting failure. I used to be attractive now people are repelled by me, even my own girlfriend would constantly talk about my weight, people would laugh at me behind my back etc. I nearly threw up every time I saw myself topless. i had periods of dieting but could never get back to my old weight.

A few months ago I discovered the online fasting community and they are huge on water fasts. For those who don't know a water fast is where you drink water but don't eat any food or consume any calories. they encouraged me to fast as long as possible and I did for a long time. I lost a lot of weight but I think it hurt my body, I felt so weak even though I took all the suggested vitamins and minerals.

Does anyone have any tips for me? Is this an actual eating disorder? I'm not sure it is, because I don't actually want to be thin it's just happening. How do I start eating normally again??. Apart from the binges I barely eat at all and I throw all that up so I continue to lose weight. I keep no food in the house because im afraid of binging. I don't know why I can't just stop. Before I water fasted I had never really binge ate before. I feel disgusting again, even though I'm not fat, and everyone wants to know how I could lose weight so quickly and I just have this humiliating secret.

There is zero chance of me ever going to the doctor for this. I need to learn how to get over it by myself. But every time I eat a normal portion of food it leads to a binge so idk what to do. Drinking stuff with calories in is okay for me, it doesn't usually lead to a binge. But I still get anxious about the calories. I've had this ""eating disorder"" for about two months now and I now want to be healthy again. Im almost underweight and I look like shit.

I started exercising at the start of January, I used to exercise a lot before I put on weight and I thought it would make me feel like myself again and it kind of does, but i push myself very hard and because I'm not eating enough I get very dizzy and have horrible headaches.

My gf is so sweet but she has no idea what's going on with me, I cringe at the thought of telling her I have this "" teen girl problem"" I know she will think less of me. But maybe she knows already though idk. She hated it when I was fat and definitely prefers me like this. Should I tell her?

I know recovering is simple, I have to start eating but I can't seem to do it because every bit of food I put in my mouth feels like poison I have to get rid of. I've started eating fruit and vegetables though and I think that might be helping. I don't usually have the same urge to binge with them.

Does anyone have any tips for me? Is this an actual eating disorder? I'm not sure it is, because I don't actaully want to be thin it's just happening. How do I start eating normally again??

I'm not too sure this is the right subreddit but my girlfriend (19) and I (18) have been dating for only 3 months. She told me quickly into the relationship that an incident happened (May 2018) resulting in her close friend at the time sexually assaulting her while she was drunk (she went into more detail). She said that any sex is off the table and I'm perfectly fine with that, I have seen her ( I guess its PTSD episodes ) if my hand is too low while kissing.

The sexual assault has resulted in insomnia and an eating disorder, she sleeps 3 hours a night max, and limits herself to a small number of calories a day, then purge and then exercise to burn twice the calories she ate on that day, I have to walk on eggshells around her and I completely understand why. She refuses to go to therapy or any sort of doctor. She tried an eating disorder therapist about 3 weeks ago and absolutely hated it, I want to be there to support her but I dont know how. She constantly tells me she's fine or good when I ask how she is feeling but I know she has headaches for weeks and is constantly nauseous and tired.

I'm concerned about her health I know that the eating disorder and insomnia is wearing away at her mentally and physically. I know she wont get better until she wants help but she constantly says she has it under control and it's not a problem. The only time she tells me she wants help is after she purges but in less than 5 minutes goes back to ""If I eat I will be fat or I wont be able to stop and get fatter"" I know I will never be able to understand what she's going through I'm just looking for any advice.",1550316295,2/16/2019 5:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ar7z6n/request_advice_regarding_my_girlfriend/,4

856,aqpwty,Request: Anorexia Recovery And Anxiety Medications - Weight Gain?," 

Hi everyone,

I am in recovery from Anorexia B/P subtype and I am now at a healthy weight, but I am still very far from recovered. My mind is completely messed up and I am just barely holding on.

I have recently started a therapy for anxiety, with Paroxetine. I found out that a common side effect of that drug is weight gain and I immediately got TERRIFIED. My psychiatrist dismissed my fears, saying that the weight gain (if it even happens) is usually due to the fact that people under meds have a better mood and therefore often eat more and they don't just put on weight randomly like that. But, while I want the meds to work, I KNOW that I am not yet in a healthy enough place to be able to stand a weight gain that not only would put me at a weight higher than I have ever been, but that I didn't intentionally choose or actively committed to. Staying at my current weight is hard enough in itself.

While my general anxiety has somewhat improved since I started the therapy, my obsessions with food have actually worsened because I am trying to preventatively ""make up"" for any possible weight gain that might happen in the future.

Should I be more direct with my psychiatrist and ask him to give me other meds? I am so afraid that at some point my fears will become too overwhelming and I will just decide to quit the therapy altogheter, with obvious disastrous effects. I know some are more weight-neutral than paroxetine, but weight gain is listed as a side effect for most if not all the meds of this kind. At the same time I know that I can't function without meds.",1550185514,2/14/2019 17:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/aqpwty/request_anorexia_recovery_and_anxiety_medications/,7
857,aqiglf,Request: Binging And Avoiding," 

So when I (18, afab nb trans) was in middle school I was really really small, and friends used to throw comments at me all the time about how they wished they looked like me. I hated it so much that I ended up putting on some weight over the summer between 8th and 9th grade. Definitely not a ton but enough to get rid of my “thigh gap” that everyone always mentioned.

My freshman and sophomore year I was honestly doing pretty good. I ate regularly and did sports and all was dandy. I got put on some antidepressants but they didn’t affect my body too much. However, I went to Japan that summer and the time difference messed up my med-taking routines and I haven’t been back on them since. I think this might play a role in how my junior and senior year went.

My junior year, I fell into a pretty bad habit of overeating. Looking through old pictures, I can see the slow gaining of weight, specifically in my face, over the next two years. I went to Japan again the summer between junior and senior year and my weight went way way up while I was there. I got back to America before school started and noticed how much I’d really gained but didn’t pay a whole lot of mind for it. Senior year came around and I noticed that I started having a back and forth: I would binge eat for about a week and then avoid food for a few days and repeat this.

The thing that bothered me a lot was I eat anxiously a lot. Like I always have to be snacking and if I’m not I get anxious and find something to eat. I told my doctor and he prescribed me an antidepressant that was suppose to repress eating urges, but I got too scared that if I started it I would never eat again, so I didn’t.

When second semester of senior year hit, I got really really depressed. I almost didn’t graduate, and my eating was all over the place, mostly binging. I forced myself into too small of a prom dress, I haven’t bought jeans in over a year because I’m so afraid of trying them on and finding out my size. I usually wear things like leggings or crop tops but lately I’ve not been able to.

I’m up way higher than I should be in weight and it’s very obvious. My biggest point of notice is my face. I hate looking in the mirror or trying to take pictures because my face is so round, but I have a square jaw so it just looks worse.

I’ve recently had to withdraw from college due to financial issues and this has also taken a huge toll on my mental health. Since coming home from college I haven’t been able to eat at all. I’m so nauseous all the time from not eating, and my stomach hurts constantly, begging me to eat but I can’t bring myself to do it. I can really only manage one meal a day that consists of hard boiled eggs or rice or a granola bar or two. I’ve weighed myself every day and logged it in a note on my phone.

I guess, to get to the point, my question is : should I seek help? I’m so afraid to talk to my mom about this, and I don’t know if I could even afford it. But I’ve seen what eating disorders do to people and I don’t know if that’s what I have but I don’t want to go down that path. I’m afraid to ask anyone if they think I have an ED because it’s not that bad. I don’t know. Im scared and hungry but I hate my body and I’m afraid how people will react. any advice is very very much appreciated. Thank you.

TLDR ; I’ve always struggled with body image issues and recently it’s developed into a pattern of over eating then under eating, and now I can’t eat more than a meal a day without hating myself. Not sure if I have an ED, and not sure if I should seek help. Thanks.",1550140727,2/14/2019 4:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/aqiglf/request_binging_and_avoiding/,0
858,aqig60,Request: Teetering On Full Blown Relapse," 

I’ve been in treatment of various levels for the past year and a half. Three stints in res, cycling back and forth through PHP and IOP, and finally discharged to outpatient 5 months ago. Things were going really well until a few weeks ago when body image just caught up with me and I slowly started to slip back into old habits. Last week, my weight was back below the “action level” my team set and if I’m down again this week, they will be referring me back to res or to find new providers (I’m over 18, so they can’t “make” me do anything at this point) because they will no longer feel comfortable treating me on an outpatient basis.

I was pretty surprised my weight was done that much. Also feeling like my minimum weight was set too high (but that’s probably my ED talking). I want to get better but I don’t want to go back to res at this point nor do I feel it’s necessary (also possibly the ED).

I’m really trying to cope with the meal plan and the increases (some of the loss is probably from hypermetabolism so I got upped a little) but I’m struggling to do it. I’m scared to be totally honest with my team because I’m pretty sure they’re just going to refer me. Also because some other symptom use (laxative abuse—I know the dangers, I really really do, but logic doesn’t work with my ED) has recently re-emerged for the first time in MONTHS that I think I can get under control on my own (again, probably the ED brain).

Anyways, I’m beginning to think I’ve dug myself a hole I can’t get out of. I don’t think going back to res is the answer. But things are starting to spiral FAST. I know myself and I know my ED and I see all the stupid shit it’s pulling and I try so hard to stop it and I just feel powerless.

Help? Advice to get myself back on track? Or advice on just ripping the bandaid off and telling all of it to me team?

none of my friends have ed’s and i don’t know where else to go with this. i posted this in another sub but it’s dead and waiting will cause more anxiety. i have edited it to follow the guidelines/rules

“my ed” was never diagnosed and i blame that on the fact that i am 5’0”, and was that height years ago when it got really bad. the lowest i got was \[removed bc of rules\] (which is kind of pathetic and not even low in my mind) i used to drink energy drinks everyday, and i still do. i’ve somewhat recovered but my caffeine addiction still continues on. i used to drink 2-3 a day but i only drink 1 now. i know that’s kind of off topic though, so i apologize. to go back on topic, i never really had the chance to talk about it professionally because whenever i brought it up in therapy, even if i cried hysterically because of how bad it made me feel, it was only “eating disorder tendencies” or “restrictive habits” but i was so bad. my ex used to force me just to eat 4 pizza rolls and that was absolute hell in my mind back then.

only one person ever really noticed it besides him, and that person just gave me the “tough love” talk and we moved on.

i’m asking for anything. i just don’t know what to do anymore. i absolutely hate myself. \[sentence removed for numbers\] my thighs are disgusting. everything about me is disgusting. i don’t even know if there’s any questions i can ask to help guide this. i know it’s asking a lot for a group of people, hell, even just one person to read all of this so i apologize. the only question i can think of, though vague, is what do i do? what’s going on? why am i here?

862,aqie5i,Request: Need Advise. Going Crazy Trying To Escape Eating Disorder," 

Hello :) I have been struggling with an ED for about 5 years now. For the first few years I felt in control and was able to manipulate my weight, but for the past two years I have gone between struggling to lose weight and struggling to be content with myself. I am constantly anxious and depressed and I want so badly to just lose the rest of my college weight and then maintain my weight and feel better. I don't know what to do anymore and I feel so isolated and lost. I don't like waking up and thinking of food anymore. I'm sick of the binge restrict cycles I go through. I don't feel in control anymore and I'm just a big bucket of self loathing now a days. I don't want to see a therapist right now because I don't have the money, and I'm opted out of my college's health plan. I have insurance but it doesn't cover mental health. I have a very supportive gf and some good friends that I know I can lean on if I just get some direction.

863,aqidvk,Request: How To Eat In Restaurants Again.," 

I’ve been in recovery for about four years now, but I’ve never been able to get over my fear and anxiety in restaurants.

There’s kind of this recent thing in America where restaurants have to label their foods with calorie counts, and I can usually be okay with finding something I can eat until I notice the numbers. Then, that’s all I can fixate on.

It almost ruined my first date with my girlfriend, she made an offhanded comment about finding something “healthy”, then I ended up freaking out about numbers and not eating anything the whole date.

It happens with other foods too, but my biggest issue is eating out. I can’t ever go out with my friends or girlfriend because of it, even eating in the campus dining hall is awful because every food is labeled.

I don’t know how to move past this.",1550139961,2/14/2019 4:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/aqidvk/request_how_to_eat_in_restaurants_again/,3

Victory! So over a year into recovery from AN/ARFID I finally sold off my high end designer teeny tiny clothes. I'd been hoarding them and struggling to let go while accepting that they represent a really sick, sad, lonely part of my life and I will never fit them again. I feel like this is the final step in accepting, with joy, that I will never be that tiny size again and *I don't want* to be that size again. No one in my personal life knows about my ED recovery journey, so I'm sharing with you lovely people here. It is possible to let go of ED and be happy at a healthy weight. I'm so proud of myself right now. A year ago I could never have done this, and if I did it would have been through sobs and self hatred. But today I am so happy and grateful to have cleansed my closet of these unhealthy reminders. Thanks so much for reading. I wish you all the same success, health, and happiness in your ED recoveries as well.

Around the time I started recovery I also started smoking marijuana to help with my intake of food as well as my depression. It greatly helped me, and combined with therapy and a good support system I’ve made great progress in recovery. Recently though, I was forced to stop smoking (job drug tests), and it’s been wreaking havoc on my insides.  Food not only tastes different, it physically makes me ill. Having the food in my mouth and chewing feels disgusting, and if I chew for too long it makes me want to vomit. I haven’t made it to the point of sickness yet (I try and swallow whatever I’m eating whole before then), but I can’t figure out why I feel like this or what’s going on. I’m wondering if anyone else in recovery has the same feelings, or if I’m just a little insane. Any tips or suggestions are greatly appreciated, I don’t want to make my family worry that I’m starving myself again because I’m really not trying to, I just don’t like the taste or feeling of food.

869,avbxxh,"Request: I’m Really Confused, Returning To Work After I Had Weight Loss Whilst Off Sick"," 

Hi guys, just looking some advice or support I guess. I don’t really know if I consider myself to have a real ED but I know my eating habits have always been unhealthy - use to be overweight/obese then went down to bottom of healthy bmi and then settled a few pounds higher.

Over Christmas this year I became very unwell with a viral infection and spent a week in hospital and a further 8 weeks off work. In hospital I ate barely anything because I was so unwell. I was also weighed every day by a nurse (almost everyone in my bay would be weighed also). I don’t know if this is relevant but feels worth mentioning, one day a nurse around the same age as me, weighed me and then weighed herself and I believed at the time she was comparing her weight to mine and really wanted to know what she weighed but didn’t ask, I still wish I did for some reason?

Anyway I don’t know but I feel like this triggered something in me and since I got out of hospital I’ve been eating 1 small “meal” a day and counting calories constantly, even counting calories of hypothetical meals that I know I’ll never eat.

I just had this idea in my head that I really wanted to be a certain weight or lower before I went back to work and when I returned to work I was that weight exactly.

People at work have commented on it, in a sympathetic “wow you must have been so unwell” sort of way, little do they know I chose to do this to myself after I got out of hospital. I didn’t think I was doing it for people at work, I mean I obviously want people to see me as thin but I’m almost ashamed to admit I feel like disappointed? that people haven’t noticed or commented on it more, I feel stupid and self centred for even saying that.

At the same time, when I was off another woman I work with lost weight and colleagues have told me she’s been speaking very openly about restricting her diet to x (small) amount of calories daily and exercising at least once a day. And I don’t know, honestly I think I might be jealous of her? Even though I know I weigh a good bit less than her, people seem to be talking about her and her weight loss constantly and expressing concern amongst themselves that she may have an ED.

Thanks for reading all of this if you’ve got this far, I’m not even sure what I’m asking for but I just feel like my thinking is really fucked up these past couple of months and i had planned to stop losing and just maintain my weight when I got back to work but really it’s just getting worse. Like I said, I’ve always had unhealthy eating habits but never anything like this before, it’s taking up so much of my headspace and I’m focusing on my weight, this woman’s weight, calorie counting and what people at work think constantly, it just feels really fucked up and it’s not like me. Like I wouldn’t even want people to talk about me and my weight behind my back like they’re doing to this woman, I just don’t understand why I’m feeling like this.

I've been on a restricted diet for over six months and it's been going well. I have been losing weight and working on myself and have had so many people supporting me. I'm a 26 year old female.

However, a couple of weeks ago I broke my diet. And as soon as I finished eating I felt so awful that I went to throw it all up.

I haven't broken my diet since then, but it's become a natural habit to throw up after everything I eat. I'm terrified about this. I honestly am not sure what to do in this situation.

I told myself I was going to stop this morning after I ate and I didn't. I feel like I should have enough self control to stop myself, but I don't. I'm afraid to say anything to my husband or family, but it scares me how regularly I'm doing this. I don't know why I can't stop.

872,auy5w9,Request: Struggling With Cooking In Recovery," 

So about 6 months ago I relapsed and I'm trying my hardest to get back into remission. I had a doctor's appointment this week and my doctor told me I really need to make an effort to gain some weight back which I expected her to say. It's hard to hear, but necessary to heal. She also asked me to slow way down on exercise until I do.

Now for a few weeks I have been having a struggle with cooking meals. I usually love to cook, but lately I loathe it. I have a family (husband and kid) so I prepare meals for all of us. It's been so difficult that last night I actually cried while cooking and by the time I was done, I was so frustrated with the entire thing that I didn't want to eat.

I really just want to get take out every day because this is so crappy for me right now but that's not an option. 1. it's too expensive and 2. too much take out makes my body feel bad (it makes my migraines/endometriosis flare, which is painful and debilitating). My husband tries to help but him cooking actually just makes everything so much worse because he asks me constantly ""what do you want"" or asks me repeatedly how to make something. I've nicely expressed to him that doing that is worse than me just cooking but he hasn't been able to temper it. It's a learning curve, this issue is new for both of us.

Anyone experience this? What solutions did you come up with? It's really hard because I prepare so much food for my family and my kiddo isn't at the age where she can do this herself yet. Meal prepping and freezer meals are not much of a solution because I don't really like leftover/reheated foods and forcing myself to eat something I don't like in the name of convenience isn't going to help (basically, any barriers to eating are going to keep me from eating). Same with TV/packaged dinners. I loathe them. When I went to residential treatment a decade ago that's all we ate and now I can't even stand the smell of them. This is so hard. I'm already thinking about/dreading cooking dinner tonight because I'm having a tough day and I know it's going to be miserable but I have to somehow do it anyway.",1551178534,2/26/2019 4:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/auy5w9/request_struggling_with_cooking_in_recovery/,2

My calorie intake is also all over the place sometimes very low, sometimes higher than I need

I also found myself slipping into forcing myself to vomit up food when I feel like I ate too much, now whenever I eat I feel the urge to vomit regardless of how much.

I think a lot of this behaviour started from feeling sick all the time from being lactose intolerant and soy intolerant. I used to get sick a lot from eating dairy and soy products and I guess I just never really stopped the behaviour after I stopped eating them.

I (21M) am seeking advice for my girlfriend (21F). When we started dating she was a normal weight for her demographic. To my understanding, she never had great eating habits (which I’ll get to). As we moved into together and she moved out of mom and dads house, she’s explained to me that her eating habits have gotten worse because she doesn’t have the parental looking over her. She only has a few foods that she will eat and those foods could be composed to the American diet; carbs, red meat, cheese, etc. No fruit or vegetables. She’ll only eat a few foods (not food groups). To which it could be described as extremely picky eating. At this point she has gained weight. I’ve tried to help her along with trying new things but there was a time when she ate one salad leaf and spit it out and puked in the toilet. She has a huge thing about texture. Right now she’s (supposed to) be eating 1 apple and 6 baby carrots a day.

I have seen posts in other subreddits that talk about how the relationship ended up discontinued because of extremely picky eating habits. I certainly don’t wish it to come to that.

She said she’s willing to see a dietitian or some therapy, we just don’t know where to go or if what she is facing is even considered disordered eating.

883,aufgfo,Request: Relapsing After Unexpected Weight (Five Years Into Recovery)," 

In 2012-2014, I suffered from EDNOS (I had symptoms of both anorexia and bulimia: e.g., extreme calorie restriction, over-exercising, and occasional episodes of purging). I was at a dangerously low weight for my height when my eating disorder was at its worst, but I began recovery in 2014 and since then I've been able to maintain a stable, healthy weight that is at or around my pre-ED weight and within the healthy BMI range for my height.

However, I started law school last fall and due to lifestyle changes (I stopped working out and have become much more sedentary) in the first semester alone I gained enough weight to put me into the overweight range for my height. Since then, I've been noticing a recurrence of my eating disorder behaviors: purging in particular.

Basically, I have been purging but not binging—I generally induce vomiting after I have dinner, my largest meal of the day. I have also been exercising almost daily for the last month and a half, but I weighed myself the other day and I have gained weight.

I don't want to relapse, but I don't want to stay at this weight—how do I approach weight loss in a healthy way? What coping mechanisms exist for when I want to purge? How do I motivate myself without slipping into bad behaviors and thought patterns?

I have done so much work on accepting myself—but it was all premised on the idea that I would remain at my post-recovery weight. I have no idea how to accept myself when I look and feel the way I do at this higher weight, and I'm terrified I will just keep gaining and gaining.

Has anyone dealt with unexpected weight gain in recovery or needing to lose weight while in recovery? It's a little shocking to me that I am five years out from my ED and still reacting this way. I am truly at a loss for what to do and could use advice/kind words/encouragement.",1551059523,2/24/2019 19:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/aufgfo/request_relapsing_after_unexpected_weight_five/,2

Also had depression, anxiety, was self harming, abusing pills and overdosed once. Now, even tho I still have the thoughts sometimes, I am kinda okay. But I have a friend who's bulimic. We haven't seen each other in really long time, couple of years, and she doesn't exactly live near by, so we communicate only online. I want to help her somehow, but I have no idea how. She's in the cycle when some days she lies to herself that everything will be allright (with really high and unrealistic expectations) and days when she gives up everything. She goes thru phases when she pushes me away, blocking me everywhere and going back in contact after some time (days, weeks or even months) like nothing happens. I know that me just being there for her like that isn't enough (I've been told that, that she doesn't even need me) but have no idea what else to do. When I'm supposed to come and see her, she just cancels it. I know how hard the struggle is, but I don't want to see her not getting any help. Because most of the time, she seems like she doesn't even want any help (which I understand, been there). She says that no one is able to understand her, that I can have no idea how she feels. She says that she doesn't trust anyone and once said that because I don't understand her problem, there is no need to be in touch with me. And I know that I can't possibly know everything, but I think that after struggling with the same shit, I can at least relate a little bit. It hurts me being helpless in this and sometimes, after some of her messages I am really close to relapsing (which makes me think how selfish, in fact, I am). 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone here has idea, how could I help her? What can I say (or more likely write) to her? I remember how hard it is to ask for help, talk about those things and have any hope in general. I also know I can't force anything on her but I just don't wanna give up.

885,atkhfi,Request: Two Therapists?," 

I've decided to start therapy to treat my disordered eating, depression, anxiety and grief and I reached out to several doctors in my area.

I found one therapist that specializes in eating disorders and body image issues, which is a huge chunk of what I'm struggling with. She doesn't take insurance and the appointments are too expensive ($115/hour) for me to be able to go every week.

Another office, that I had been put on a waiting list for, just reached out and said the therapist is taking a few new patients. She lists eating disorders as one of the things she treats, but it’s not a specialty per se. They offer a sliding scale and it's much more affordable ($30/hour) so I'd be able to go every week.

I'm setting up an initial consultation appointment with both of them.

Is it worth it to see someone more specialized but less frequently OR is it better to go more frequently but to someone that isn't as specialized? Can I see both of them?

Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks!",1550857388,2/22/2019 11:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/atkhfi/request_two_therapists/,7
886,atgcr6,request: Picky eater and binge eating?,"I know a lot of people say extremely picky eating is ARFID, but I don't fit most of the symptoms (such as underweight, nutrition-deficiency, etc). My main issue is that when trying new foods, especially specific textures, I have a strong urge to vomit and literally can't stomach trying new foods. It is starting to really impact my life as I enter my early 20s and find my ""picky eating"" affecting social opportunities, and even just preparing foods on a daily basis. It's hard for me to tell the difference between foods I dislike and foods that give me an unnaturally strong reaction. The thought of trying new foods outside of my self-designated ""safe"" category gives me a lot of anxiety. I also have BED (diagnosed) but not yet in treatment, except seeing a therapist 2x a week.

887,atgcb1,Request:Where Do I Go From Here?,"I think I have an eating disorder, and  (I think) I’ve come to terms with my problem. I need advice on where to go from here. 

I keep justifying my habits, but deep down I know It’s not okay so here I am.

Okay, here’s like a mini table of contents. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I’m going to explain why “I think” I have an ED. Honestly that part is mostly for me and I’m just trying to make myself realize how real it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. There is actual concerns after #1 where I am open to advice on.

&amp;#x200B;

Alrighty here goes nothing:

1. First some Stats: (deleted b/c numbers) based on BMI charts I went from Obese to the lower end healthy weight in less than a year
2. Reasons I am led to believe I have an eating disorder:

\-I fast almost daily.  How long my fast is depends on if I skip dinner that day as well.

\-When I do eat dinner it’s the same exact dinner set under “x” calories. (Most days I run on pretty much entirely caffeine and cigarettes.)

\-Every morning I workout, weigh myself, and then take measurements with a tape measure.

\-I constantly do wrist checks, collar bone checks, and hip bone checks.

\-I’ve recently noticed my “binges” are normal people calories. i.e. the other day I had a “low” cal binge and then did cardio until my fitness watch showed double the calories burned.

(These last two reasons are my biggest shames)

\-I have purged a after a really bad binge on a few occasions

\-I’m now a fat shamer. I don’t want to be, in fact i hate it. But I think my brain needs to hate/be disgusted by overweight people as like “motivation” to no be overweight?

\*\*\****2. Concerns***\*\*\*\*\*

So why now?

In short: It’s ruining my life.

1. It’s embarrassing

Not only am I insanely weak now, I get caught doing wrist checks, my clothes are too big on me and when I buy more, those just eventually become too big on me as well. Lately, my biggest issue has been going out to eat. Friends constantly want to go eat. \*\*\*\*AND so do DATES. There is a girl i am very attracted to, and we’ve gone on a few dates.

But I think she’s catching on, because the last time we went out she pointed out how little I had eaten and asked “aren’t you going to finish you \_\_\_\_?”. With a concerned tone.

I instantly was mortified. No one has ever pointed out my eating habits before. Like what if she thinks something’s wrong with me? No one wants to date a broken person.

2. I’m a fucking adult.

\-I’m about done with grad school and I’ve been going to a lot of career events. A lot of these events involve going to nice dinners with important people. (Clearly an issue)

\-I feel like most people my age are trying to maintain their health, but I’m over here deteriorating it.

\-adults have kids at some point? I want kids but I do not by any means want kids being a bad role model for eating habits.

\-I’m supposed to be “starting my life” but this is so draining, I don’t have the motivation to start anything.

I don’t even know where to begin. Like I mentioned before, no one has ever pointed out my eating habits before. So as far as I know, no one has caught on. I’ve tried telling my friends and talking to them about. But I can’t bring myself to say it.

And then I don’t know how stop. I don’t even know if I necessarily want it to stop. I mean It’s like in theory I want it to stop, but as soon as that scale goes up I freak out.

TL;DR: I don’t eat, I need to eat, but I can’t eat

Can anyone offer advice? What should I do next?",1550834026,2/22/2019 5:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/atgcb1/requestwhere_do_i_go_from_here/,3
888,atgb21,"Request: Didn't Think This Would Be A Possibility Until Recently, But Is My Eating Disordered?"," 

TL;DR: Have been restricting my eating for the past couple months so that I barely get hungry and can't finish the food I start. I've always been a healthy weight but can feel myself getting weaker. My body has never looked better but am I pushing it too much?

Hi, I'm 21F and over the past couple months it's been really hard for me to eat, to the point where I have practically no appetite anymore. I was studying abroad last semester, and ever since I've been home/back at college here, I've felt the need to eat less and less. I'm currently long distance with my girlfriend, and I wonder if that has something to do with it, as it's been difficult for me to eat in the past when I've been in that kind of sadness.

I have no history of mental health problems, although I occasionally get quite anxious but it's never felt like enough to do something about, and have always been a healthy weight, playing sports year round all my life until college. I've exercised sporadically the past couple years (once or twice a week), but I tried running on the treadmill last week and after 10 minutes felt very weak and had to leave, even though I'd had yogurt and cereal before. I've always been fine with my weight, although I was never the smallest, but I have a pretty athletic and toned body even though I'm definitely losing a lot of the muscle I had in high school. I've been happy seeing my face and legs get slimmer and my collarbone and jaw get more defined. I haven't been able to weigh myself since I've been back at school, but at home I do quite a bit and would try to keep it between a certain range. Before school I was just a bit into the healthy weight zone and I'm afraid I'm under it now because I can definitely feel my lack of eating taking a toll.

I usually take normal amounts at the dining hall for breakfast but I can never finish much more than half, then I'll snack throughout the night and maybe have something a bit bigger for dinner. It's quite hard for me to finish most things I start eating, and I feel bad for wasting food so I get frustrated with myself. I'll not eat long enough so my stomach hurts, but it's rarely until then that I even feel hungry and I feel really hungry. Then I'll take a couple bites of something and not be able to have any more. I drink a decent amount of water, but I eat a bit of candy and haven't been getting as many veggies as I do at home, just lots of plain carbs and fruit.

I feel weak, tired, and slightly headachey most of the time, sometimes out of breath. I smoke weed every day and it's never affected my body any way that I could tell, and I still have time to be productive/creative. I'm doing well in school although I feel exhausted a lot of the time and stressed about it, my grades are good. Haven't been to the doctor in a couple years because I haven't needed to, but I know that would be a good step.

I think I enjoy restricting my eating because I've never been happier with my body and just want it to look better, but I'm disappointed in myself because I know I'm hurting it in the long run. I've talked to my girlfriend (she used to have an ED and I think has some relapses occasionally) and she checks in on me, and I've talked to my friend a bit as well but not in much detail. My parents always comment that I look skinnier when they see me and ask if I'm eating enough and I always say it's alright.

Do these seem like disordered tendencies that I should seek help about? Or should I start by trying to force myself to eat more? Just not sure how serious it is/could be, I can't really see myself trying to starve myself until I was stick thin, but maybe it would be too late. I'm new to this.

I gained significant weight for the first time in my life (currently a young adult) since taking an office job and struggling to find the motivation to exercise as I used to.

For the last two weeks or so I've been eating almost nothing. But I'm not disgusted or afraid to eat food in any way, I'd just rather not.

At first I didn't think anything of it as it was just to lose weight fast along with exercise for a while but it's become normal now and I don't see why I should go back to eating the way I was if I feel better now, even though I know it's not good for me in the long run.

I'm unsure if this actually is turning into an eating disorder (or showing symptoms of one) or just a lesser problem as I honestly feel fine as I am despite all the exercise. I'm thinking it may just be bad eating habits but am unsure as my friend raised their concerns with me because of other current mental health issues (depression, anxiety etc.)

893,atg84a,Request: Texture Aversion," 

Food just doesn't taste good to me. Not only that but I'm allergic to wheat, sometimes my brain tricks me into thinking I ingested it by making my throat close. I'm also lactose intolerant and don't eat meat because of the texture. I desperately want to gain weight, but never been able to. I don't eat more than 2 small meals, if at all, per day. I wear baggy jeans and a belt to create the illusion that my legs aren't literal bones with skin.

I know these things get taken up in therapy, but I currently am in a program for anxiety, depression, ADHD and PTSD. I'm also on meds that have for the first time in my life given me an appetite. But I can never bother myself to make a meal.

I'm a person that needs routine. ADHD and PTSD really mess with me because I am always in a cycle of being too distracted to eat, and when I do eat I will end up spitting food out, vomiting, or only eating a little bit because the taste or texture is offensive to my taste buds. For example, I avoid eating food with canola oil in it. I worked at a fry joint where they would never clean the frying oil, the smell was awful and lingered, had to throw out my work clothes and quit. Now just smelling it makes me lose it.

My mom also triggers me. She's a faux health nut and reads too many articles about the risks of eating too much rice, or corn, or seaweed, because they are toxic and will make you ill for reasons unknown. She buys into it and then tells me not to eat certain foods, reinforcing my already bad habits and limiting my food choices.

Gonna go to a group session soon for this, but I just need to feel like there's other people out there with insight.

Anyone got any idea how to start a little meal plan, or how they plan food around a busy day? That would be really helpful.",1550833227,2/22/2019 5:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/atg84a/request_texture_aversion/,2

I am a 28 year old male. I have suffered with anxiety pretty much my whole life. Recently, I have had trouble eating around others. Whether it’s eating in a public restaurant or eating at someone’s house, the whole situation gives me anxiety.

I have no problem going out to eat in public by myself or eating alone at home, I can usually finish the meal. I am also usually fine with family or close friends. However, as soon as you add a co worker, someone I am not close with, or a stranger into the mix, I am very anxious and tend to overthink the whole situation. This anxiety is due to my overthinking that “what if I get sick and vomit” or “ what if I order a meal and am not able to eat it or finish it” or “what if I’m only able to pick at the meal”. If there is a bathroom nearby where I can “escape,” sometimes I feel better and am able to calm down. However if there isn’t, I tend to get more anxious.

There are many times Ill sit and overthink the whole situation and scare myself beforehand and think of everything “bad” that could happen. In reality, it’s not even that bad. Therefore, sometimes I can calm myself down or sometimes I can.

He will not admit it though and believes he is perfectly healthy. Others have also commented on his weight and even my mother voiced her concerns and told him that she’s worried about him. Instead of understanding why another individual might think and feel this way, he threw a fit.

902,axjutb,Request: Question - Husband Of Wife Who Is Recovering From ED," 

Question: How do I open up to my wife about how frustrated and tough it’s been for me while she is in residential treatment without triggering her to once again blame/hate herself?

My wife is in a residential treatment center for ED and will be home in the next few weeks. It’s been tough these last couple of months not having her at home. It took residential for my eyes to open about her struggles. During my time alone I’ve cried many nights thinking about how I wasn’t able to see the signs or “hear” her cries for help.

I believe her.

During my visits I confessed my guilt of not truly being able to understand but have since committed to being by her side and doing whatever I can to support her even if that means just holding her. Gone are the days where I’m more concerned about fixing the symptom (e.g. getting her to eat thinking that was the issue).

I truly love her and will spend the rest of my life on the path to recovery with her. She will never walk it alone.

However I’m frustrated. I feel selfish for thinking this way but the last two months alone have been so tough. Having to take care of the house, our pets, family problems, a new job, and other typical drama has me stretched thin. I’m emotionally drained and it’s beginning to physical exhaust me. Don’t get me wrong, I am happily doing whatever I have to do to ensure my wife can receive the support she truly needs but I underestimated the toll it would have on me over a couple of months.

I’ve expressed this to her but it makes her feel guilty and she becomes distracted from her treatment and starts to slip. I find myself in a situation where I’m now bottling my own struggles so that she can recover care free... as a result.. I’m afraid that I’m beginning to somewhat resent that I don’t have the freedom to express myself without indirectly being the cause of her triggers. I’ve tried to explain this to her but she can’t help feeling guilt and so I keep it to myself.

Now she will be coming home in a few weeks and I’m afraid of just word-vomiting my feelings and triggering her... but I also don’t want to keep it bottled in.. because it honestly hurts.

I love my wife and I’ll never truly understand what it’s like to experience her struggles but in this recovery period... she’s not the only one in pain.

25/Female

&amp;#x200B;

Hi there,

Since high school I’ve had a history of disordered eating (primarily bulimia with periods of strict fasting). I saw a specialist when I was 15 and had a dietitian (who also acted as a therapist tbh) until I graduated and felt “relived” of my symptoms (I was not practicing, but the thoughts never go away).

When I went to college I started back with my bulimia (I was typically someone who would only purge “traditionally”? but had started experimenting with laxatives). I lived in a residence building and would literally hide in the public washrooms to purge to avoid being seen by my floormates.

Since then I’ve been on and off again, relapsing into heavy bulimia when I’ve gotten stressed until about 8 months ago where I’ve been in a really good place. Not practicing, but I *constantly* think about food, calories, purging, what people think about me, etc. In a world so focused on diets and what not the contradicting health information makes my head spin. Occasionally I’ll have a moment of “oh, so I don’t have to be extreme and I can just eat healthy and stay active and that’s what everyone else does?” but then I’m constantly planning my meals and overthinking everything I get so mentally exhausted.

I had a problem with circulation in my ankle so my doctor (a new GP with no history of my ED) sent me to a weight loss clinic because I’m overweight (weird how your metabolism stops when you abuse it like that for 10+ years). Anyway, I was prescribed Saxenda, a weight loss medication, to aid with weight loss. I was also immediately offered a referral for gastric bypass because our health system (I’m in Canada) is so messed up that everyone rushes to fix the physical problem and not the mental (I realize I should have expressed my past but not going to lie I love this medication and the former ED in my head loves the idea of a gastric bypass because then I’ll have less to think about with food... technically).

I’m just so overwhelmed and I want to talk to my closest friend about this (my mom doesn’t like talking about it and I want someone more personal than my therapist). I’m just so embarrassed about my past / feel like I’ll come off as if I’m seeking attention / lazy / I don’t know. This friend is someone who I met in college and we would do things like go to McDonalds at midnight and then I would excuse myself to purge and they had no idea. It’s gross and I also don’t want them to worry about me. I just need support and I don’t know what to do.

Not going to lie — the past few months have been rough. Around 5-6ish months ago, I began to restrict my calories to a very small amount. I'm thin, but not technically underweight according to BMI. However, during that span of time I lost my period &amp; underwent multiple other side effects.

This slowly morphed into a binge/restrict cycle, where I'd reduce my intake even more to try and recover from the binges I’d have throughout the week. This has been happening for a while now (about 3 months).

I’m sick and tired of it. I hate living my life like this. I avoid events with food as much as possible, and usually decline my friends’ offers to hang out because it’s my “starvation” day to make up for a binge.

I’m heavier than my lowest of few months ago, but still in the lower end of normal BMI . I feel disgusting, and I hate it, but I know I need to break out of this cycle.

Honestly, I struggle with how much I’m supposed to eat in a day. I generally believed that the low number of calories I ate was enough for me. I’m 15, 5’1, and am currently in track. I try those online “calorie calculators” but all of them give me vastly different amounts, all much higher than what I'm eating.

Not only this, but to anyone who’s been through something similar: how do you stay motivated? Is there any advice you can give me to help me power through this? I really, really want this to end. I want to have a normal relationship with food. I’m sick and tired of this.

I’m just so terrified of gaining weight. I used to be heavier … towards the upper end of the normal BMI range, and can’t imagine ever going back to that point. I want to be healthy, but I feel as though a darker part of my mind doesn’t care about being healthy and just wants to be thin.

I’ve never told anyone about this, and this seemed like a good place to let my heart out and open up. Thank you for taking the time to read this. :) I’m not sure if anyone would be interested or if it mattered at all, but I’m thinking about posting my progress here in order to hold myself accountable.

905,axjre2,Request: Finally Admitted I Have A Disorder... How Can I Learn To Love Myself?," 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I fully admitted to myself that I have an eating disorder. I’m tired of putting on the facade that I don’t struggle with a severely unhealthy relationship with food, my body image, and overall self love. I’ve struggled with binge eating for as long as I can remember, but lately I’ve started to purge as well. It’s a new thing, so I want to start right now while it’s young and really get to the bottom of this before it gets worse. First, I asked why? Why am I doing this to myself? 

I am terrified of being overweight. I’m a firefighter, I workout very hard, and to outsiders I look extremely strong and fit. I’ve built my identity around being disciplined, and in my eyes a disciplined body looks slightly more lean than mine. I am fit, and these extra few lbs I’ve been obsessing over DONT MEAN A THING! But for god knows how long, I’ve been restricting, calorie counting, you name it. Thus led to my absolute obsession with food. What I would eat, when I would eat it, how I would eat it, what I couldn’t eat, etc. The second I finish a meal it’s like I’m already obsessing over the next one. This is NO way to live? Ultimately the restriction failed me and in times of stress, loneliness, or sadness, I’d binge. And I would be numb for a little bit. But the second I finish I’m overwhelmed with shame and disgust, and even more overwhelmed with the fear of “getting fat”. So I started the habit of purging, which led me even further down the rabbit hole of self hatred and cruel self-talk. You’re disgusting, a failure, no self control, so unhealthy, why are you so vain?? 

Truly though I think this is deeper than just body image. I have deep-seated self esteem issues. I have a history of self-destructive behavior and self-hatred, the roots of which I still haven’t uncovered yet. But as it’s shifted toward bulimic patterns, I realized I cannot let this get the best of me. I’m done. I’m ready to start moving in a direction of healing and self love. I did research on the disorder. I texted a friend I trust and simply said “I have an eating disorder, just felt I needed to tell someone”. Accountability is huge in this process. And then, the hardest part, I fed myself. I binged this morning and subsequently told myself I was going to “fast” (by the way, no more of that) for the rest of the day. No food. Well, by dinner time I was hungry. And I realized that the only way to stop this obsession with food was to give my body what it wants, when it wants it, and listen to natural cues. So I went to the kitchen, and I ate. I had some rice, an apple with honey, and some cashews. Could I have binged? Yeah, but I didn’t. Did I overeat today? Honestly, yes. But the point is I need to change these neural pathways. I deleted MyFitnessPal. Done counting calories for a while. Just listening to hunger cues, satiety cues, and nourishing myself!

  
I’m not going to sit here and stress about every single thing I ate and run the grand total of calories through my mind over and over again. Life is too damn short. Maybe I gain a few pounds. I probably won’t. But maybe you do? Who gives a damn!? Anyone who’s love is true and worth anything will love you at any physical state. the same goes for love you have for yourself. So be kind to yourself. Eat and eat well, and start living.

908,axjpl8,Request: ED - Binge Eating Cycle. What Can I Do Now?," 

Hi everyone.

So, I've always had a problem with food and I seem to swing between periods of having some control over it, and periods of being completely out of control.

I'm 34, and I think I have an eating disorder, but it doesn't really ""fit"" with any of the definitions that I read about.

I have never purged. But I binge. And I binge to some worrying extremes.

Every day I feel a compulsion to have at least one ""session"" where I consume a huge amount of calories. Usually easy to open and eat foods like crisps and confectionary.

When I am done with work for the day, my journey home almost always includes going past a shop of some kind so I can stock up on this stuff. And I feel a massive amount of anxiety at the idea of not getting ""enough"" to satisfy the compulsion. So I over-buy. Which usually results in my just eating it all anyway. Once I'm done with eating everything, I usually feel like I've fulfilled the compulsion, as long as its in excess.

I can sometimes control this, and skip the shop on the way home, but this results in massive anxiety as I pace around at my home, and try to talk myself out of going out and buying stuff. Apps that will deliver terrible food to my home are deadly...

When I do this, I do it alone. And getting time alone, all to myself, is part of the compulsion. When I spend time with my GF I always feel like I want to leave a little bit early, so I have some time in the evening to spend satisfying this need. I hide this completely from everyone and nobody knows about it.

I often do not enjoy the food as I am eating it. And sometimes I am finishing off a huge packet of crisps, despite my mouth feeling like it is irritated, and hurting as a result.

Then of course follows the giant downer of having done it. And I feel very depressed and hopeless.

My health right now is bad. And I am very heavy - although I'm quite tall so I can carry it, but I am edging towards just looking like a massively obese person, and these feelings of shame compound the issue.

I have depression and anxiety. I am on a waiting list for cognitive behavioural therapy (six months) and I am seeing a private therapist starting this Tuesday, although I can't afford to see her that many times...(mental health care in the UK sucks.)

Does anyone have any experience with this stuff, and can they help me? What can I do *tonight* to try and break this cycle? I really really really wish I had control over this but it feels pretty hopeless right now.

909,axjp5h,Request: ED Concern for family member. Major health issue?,"Hi guys,

I know this will be long, but I would really appreciate the help. To start off, a family member of mine told me today they believe they have a eating disorder. I don't see her all the time, so I wasn't able to catch on to the issue disappointingly. I only see her for like half the week and only after the evening. She only told me today because she thinks its gotten serious.

1. She believe she had it since at least last summer, but she hasn't seeked help at all. Is that a serious concern? I know ED can lead to serious health concerns?
2. She doesn't want to see the doctor or anything. I've been trying to convince her. What would be good ways to convince her? Also, what steps should I take to make them feel better and help her cure ED?
3. Some symptoms: Preoccupation with food, weight, calories, and diet. Refusal to eat certain things at times and crave certain things at time. Skipping meals, extreme concern with weight, mood swings. Always thin, with fluctuation in weight. And today she has difficulty breathing, stomach cramps, constipation, and a desire to vomit. Also, she told me that Saturday night she woke up from sleeping and blacked out and had diarrhea while sweating a lot.

She doesn't want to get treatment and been going on for at least a year.

I know its bad of me to not notice, but I don't see her all the time. And she had some of these habits before. Like shes always had mood swings and cared about her looks, so I thought it was normal. Additionally, I never experienced anything related to ED. Anyways, I really really want to help her beat ED and slowly get better before it gets to serious. I would really appreciate any help or input, especially for question 1 and 2. 

&amp;#x200B;

More importantly, is there a possibility if there being life threatening concern?

I posted over on Make me feel better about how I don't feel like I  can eat when my parents are around, and how that has halted my weekend. A  user from there said I should check this sub out to be sure I don't  have an eating disorder.

I can't eat something I have prepared myself when my parents are  around, mostly because of my own worries. They have commented on my  weight and how I eat, multiple times, but if I eat something healthy,  they'll just whine about how I'm actively trying to lose weight (even  though I'm not, I like to eat different stuff different days. Currently I  do more exercise than usual, but that's because I feel weak, and I want  to build up some muscles).

They don't do that often, but it has sparked me to not want to eat  when they are in the same room, or in the house.  This morning it halted my entire routine, because I wanted to go for a  run, but I need to eat before that, and after the run I wanted to take a  bath and clean my room and so on.

Someone from that sub helped me feel ok about just starting off with  cleaning my room, and another said I should check this place out.

I have had troubles with my mental health in the past, and i thought  this was a weird anxiety thing, but hey, you can't be too sure.

912,awzegv,Request: Dealing with a strict medical diet?," 

Hi! I have a history of  AN/BN, I wouldn't say I'm 100% recovered (although does anyone get  there?), but I've been maintaining a healthy weight for years and  usually manage 3 meals a day.

I'm having some medical issues (autoimmune) that I'm having trouble  getting under control, and I'm running low on options other than getting  into some of those autoimmune diets. I already have a restrictive diet  (Celiac), but I still eat some junk and can do the social aspect of  ""fun"" eating like going out for ice cream, sharing potato chips and  candy, etc.

So I'm really worried doing one of those strict healthy-autoimmune  diets will trigger a relapse. Especially since all of the recipe sites  border on orthorexia with all of their talk of food being  pure/clean/""detoxing"". Plus I find that social eating is a really  important part of recovery, and I'm worried about being the weirdo that  goes out to meet my friends and just orders a cup of herbal tea.

Like to ask about food coma after meals. (Eating disorder's - anorexic/arfid) I could not get the facts/answers and judge if the information read online/social media are correct or helping.

psychiatrist, gastroenterologist and dietitian do not really want to address this concern but rather focuses on my weight. It has been affecting my daily life, routines, work for some time already.

different recommendations I've read tried mostly - too much carbs - inbalanced meals - because of simple carbs, should try complex carbs - go for keto or smoothie  - insulin resistance, gluten-intorlence, food-allergy, etc... - wrong meal timings - meal sizes and portions - hclf, lchf, whole-food, plant based, etc... - walk (some sort of activity) after meals

I am kinda exhausted of ""troubleshooting""...

too make the mind confused and worse, some times the same amount of  food can give a different effect... and there are awkward times where I  can even consume more of the same food without issue (but this is only  once in a while).

in addition, regardless of food type/taste, I also seemed to have a  weird aftertaste in my mouth. mostly soury and takes time before it gets  rid of itself.

this has been going on for at least a while already. I don't think those antiacid nor metospasyml medication helps much..

I missed part of Christmas last year because I didn’t want to  be around food, I skip a lot of social events because it’s just too  stressful and eating at a restaurant is basically out of the question (I  will cry and have a meltdown in the car as soon as we’re there).

Cooking for myself every  day has helped me recover from bulimia and I've been in remission for  several years now. When I cook for myself, I see exactly what I'm going  to eat and I become familiar with it. Bulimia is all about control and  I've found a nice, moderate approach to meeting my body's needs.  For instance, I try to eat lots of veggies. I take veggie snacks to  work, I get produce delivery, and I try a new veggie every week or so to  encourage diversity in my eating and cooking habits. I enjoy eating and  I take time making my food. Cooking is how I unwind from a hard job and  while it means standing for a little longer, it's totally worth it. My local grocery store has certain 50% off deals for produce they want  off the shelves and I use that to diversify my diet as well. I take  reusable shopping bags and I have some cheap reusable produce bags that I  bought online so I can get the fresh items. I've maintained food's specialness without hurting myself.

I went through (and I guess am still going through) an ED. Originally brought on by a terrible self image that was created after wasting away my post-college years in a drunk stupor that saw me gain weight. After snapping out of this my ED started. I carb and calorie restricted and would run and exercise excessively. In a span of a year I dropped a significant amount of weight. I remember waking up one morning and feeling absolutely floored. Despite the realization I was significantly underweight my dive into nutrition and trying to figure out the perfect diet. I knew (and still know) I need to gain weight but there is a mental barrier I have yet to break. I have reintroduced carbs into my life and have been happy to do so. 

For those of you with better knowledge than me, how much is too much exercise? I know we are supposed to get daily activity but when does it become too much? For me I just can't get passed a day of inactivity or not getting my heart rate up and sweating. I know there are drawbacks from overexercise and believe I am experiencing them. I have anxiety, insomnia, a significantly lower heart rate at times, and feel generally sluggish and on-edge. My blood pressure, which was high prior to my obsessive eating patterns, was recently measured and is pretty low. My typical week consists of seven days of exercise with at least one of those days being a little more ""relaxed"". I have three strength training/HIIT sessions per week that last about over an hour and a fifteen minutes and have three straight cardio sessions where I keep my heart rate elevated for an hour worth of work. My ""relaxed"" day is a day I spend on the spin bike just rotating my legs for an hour. Is that too much exercise? The part I am having trouble with is that I hear and read stories about people pushing it A LOT harder than I do in the gym. They exercise even more and are not suffering from any of the symptoms I am.

923,avpqmj,Request: ED Concerns," 

Hi,

I'm really struggling with a possible ED and would love some advice from the world.

I am concerned about my weight, mainly by how I look to others. I am female and 5'7"". I am very malnourished but think that eating is repulsive and nauseating. I have been thin since I was a child and have had the hardest time putting on/keeping weight. Two years ago, I became dangerously underweight. My family immediately admitted me into an impatient treatment that specialized in ED's (although, I have never been diagnosed with one). There, I gained weight but was supervised and forced to finish my food (including three meals, three snacks, and three Ensure drinks a day).

I plan on getting tested for an ED soon. I am sick and tired of being sick and tired!

If someone could give some advice to what I may have or what would help I would really appreciate it.",1551350604,2/28/2019 4:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/avpqmj/request_ed_concerns/,1
924,avpq87,Request: Is It Possible I Lose Weight In Recovery From BED?," 

Had atypical anorexia as a teen. Morphed into EDNOS and finally into BED when I left home at 18. I’m 25 now, no active ED behaviours and few thoughts/urges for a while. But I currently fall into the obese weight category. Haven’t weighed myself in quite a while, partly because I’m afraid and partly because I don’t want to trigger myself, but I’m pretty sure it’s around that area.

I want to lose the weight, my doctor advised it will help with my joint pain and, lets be honest, I think it would be good for my self image too, but I really don’t know how. Whenever I’ve tried in the past, Ive gotten triggered and ended up severely restricting or fasting for weeks. Then I binge a whole lot. Then I just go back to eating normally 🤷🏽‍♀️

Even trying to take small steps, make small changes, like changing the milk in my coffee, starts me off on fixating on weight and calories and numbers. Doesn’t matter how slow I try to go or how small I make the changes, it triggers me.

I just don’t know how to do it. I know all the theory, but I don’t know how to do it without ending up stuck on that shit coaster again. Is it even possible?",1551350516,2/28/2019 4:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/avpq87/request_is_it_possible_i_lose_weight_in_recovery/,4

928,avpoby,Request: Seeking advice on binge eating," 

Hello, I don’t know where else to go. I don’t know for sure, I haven’t opened up to my therapist or anyone about this. I think I have a binge eating disorder. I recently read something from a friend who shared a long post about her struggle between ED’s and I found it relatable and in a way shocking. I felt like it described what I’ve been dealing with for many years now. I have never been healthy with myself mentally about my weight. Not really physically either. I’ll sum things up by saying, the first bite is what does it. I tell myself LITERALLY talk to myself saying “no, we are not going to do that, it’s unhealthy you don’t need it” and then I succumb to the choice to have a bite and then I can’t stop. I can’t stop at all, it’s embarrassing and it has been a private issue I’ve struggled with for such a long time now.. I didn’t think much of it. I figured everyone struggles with this. But I don’t think they do. My friend put it like this “it’s like I’m on autopilot” and that really feels true. By the time my binge is complete I can’t even remember everything I ate and there is never any reason that it should have happened and .. i dont know . 

It’s all a private thing.. I opened up a little to my boyfriend last night about it, and he was supportive. I don’t feel like talking about it anymore to anyone I know though. It’s embarrassing. I keep trying to eat healthy and it works until I’m alone. My thoughts about food are unhealthy. I don’t know how to stay healthy or prevent myself from binging. I

 guess I came here mostly to vent or find support I hope.. some advice. Maybe there’s an ED discord group chat.. anything to help me navigate this. I don’t trust anyone enough to get help yet. But I feel sort of safe here.

929,b0g2sq,Request: Graduate student seeking participants in diabulimia survey," 

&amp;#x200B;

Hello! My name is Nicole Antoniadis, and I am a graduate student at Pacific University in Hillsboro, Oregon, USA. I am currently completing my dissertation on the effect of coping strategies on anxiety and depression in people with diabulimia (which is the omission or manipulation of insulin doses for the purpose of weight loss). This study aims to identify specific styles of coping which prove to be effective at decreasing the impact of anxiety and depression in people with diabulimia. These co-occurring problems can make recovery intensely difficult, so identifying more effective coping styles may lead to more successful treatment strategies. If you are interested in taking part in this study, please follow the anonymous link below to the study survey. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes to finish and it is voluntary and anonymous. There are no risks for participating in this study. You must be 18 or older, have type 1 diabetes, and have a history or current experience with diabulimia in order to participate. At the end you will be given the opportunity to enter a raffle for one of three $20 Amazon gift cards as a thank-you for your participation. You may also sign up to receive the results of the study once it is completed. This study has been approved by the Pacific University IRB board (1315172-1) and is being supervised by Dr. Ruth Zuniga.

Thank you in advance for your participation!

930,b0g1qy,Request: How To Stop Exercise Guilt?," 

After gaining a considerable amount of weight in my first year of university, I started weight training in hopes of gaining muscle and losing weight.

That was almost a year ago, and since then I’ve been a lot more careful with what I eat (admittedly maybe a little too careful, as I started tracking calories to maintain my weight and prevent myself from gaining), and I’ve been consistently training about 5-6x a week. A recent injury has prevented me from going to the gym, however, and now I feel this constant guilt of not being active, as well as fear of gaining weight and losing all the progress I have made.

Any suggestions on how to combat exercise guilt? The injury is quite serious so I know I shouldn’t go back to training too soon, but it’s really hard for me, especially since it’s become such a habitual thing to do.",1552440519,3/12/2019 20:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/b0g1qy/request_how_to_stop_exercise_guilt/,3

I feel like I lost my chance to tell my boyfriend about my past problems with EDNOS. He had commented that he made a joke to a female coworker about how slowly she was eating her muffin (she was picking at it throughout the morning). She had responded by saying that she always ate super slowly and that her live-in boyfriend gets frustrated with her but that's just how she eats. He told this to me like it was a joke, like we were to laugh at this girl's odd habits. I told him that she could've had an eating disorder or something and that his joke wasn't really appropriate. We both shrugged it off and didn't really continue the conversation (he basically said he supposed that was possible). Now, I'm wishing I used it to open up the conversation about how I had an EDNOS a few years ago and that's how I initially lost most of my weight (I have since sought therapy for a variety of issues, reached a healthy weight, and found several sports that I love and that keep me feeling well).

934,b0fzg9,Request: Slipping Back Into Old Habits," 

Over the summer I noticed that my bad habits and unhealthy thoughts around food were getting worse and started spiraling out of control. At the time it scared the hell out of me and I was lucky to be able to reach out to family and friends and wrestle it back under control before it got worse. For a while I was doing much better, in some ways, even better than I had been before the habits had worsened because I'd been forced to confront thinking processes that had been lying under the surface for years.

Then my life got bad again. I lost my job and then just a couple months later my grandma, who I've always been close to, passed away. I fell into a deep depression and struggled to get through each day. Now, two months later I'm starting to feel like myself again, but it's come with a strange side effect. As I start to feel productive and focused again, I'm feeling myself inclined to lose weight again. It seems like when I'm restricting my eating and counting calories I get the same feeling of accomplishment and pride in myself as I do when I clean my room or do well at my job.

When my issues flared up last summer, I never felt good about it, instead the main driver of my actions was shame about how I looked and how ""unhealthy"" my diet was. The remedy there was very hard but pretty intuitive, I knew that I needed to force myself to confront my body image and focus on accepting how I looked, but I don't really know how to disentangle the positive feeling of recovery from my depressive episode from the dangerous thinking I'm starting to experience again.

Has anyone experienced this kind of thing? What's the path forward? I feel like I made so much progress in terms of fixing my disordered eating in the last few months and all that progress is disappearing.",1552440128,3/12/2019 20:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/b0fzg9/request_slipping_back_into_old_habits/,1

937,b01aci,Request: feel like I'm starting to spiral into an eating disorder and don't know how to help myself.," 

So a bit of background. I was a bit of chubby kid in grade school but found a healthy way to lose weight in high school. I was at a normal weight for my age and height and although I was still self-conscious of my weight and how I looked, I was still relatively okay with my body image. Before I went to college everyone I knew would joke about ""the freshman 15"" and telling me I was going to gain weight and for some reason that really scared me. My freshman year I ate healthy, I went to the gym, but I still ate the occasional junk food and felt okay about myself.

This year, though, I feel like I'm sliding down a slippery slope. The year started and I've been counting calories, and I know my intake is way too low. I work out at the gym for way too long doing way too much cardio and then I'll go back to my room and do more exercise videos. Some days I'll write out my planned meals for the day and all of the calories that they have and I don't go past that amount. I drink an unnecessary amount of coffee and call that meal because it has barely any calories. If I eat even the smallest bit of junk food, I'll end up almost in tears and force myself to go for a walk or go to the gym because I feel like I didn't deserve that. I've recently started looking at these scarily thin girls and thinking ""damn do I wish I looked like that."" I feel like somewhere in the back of my head I know that I'm not fat and that it's okay to have some snacks or an actual full meal, but I can never bring myself to eat a healthy amount without feeling guilty or crying about it. I know I'm losing weight, but I'm still at a fairly healthy weight for my age and height, but I always say to myself ""just a few more pounds. Just lose a few more, you're still at a healthy weight, you can afford to lose a few more."" And sometimes when people say they're concerned with how little I'm eating or how much weight I've lost, I almost enjoy their concern.

I know this isn't normal, but I don't know how to help myself, or if I even want to help myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1552351356,3/11/2019 19:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/b01aci/request_feel_like_im_starting_to_spiral_into_an/,5

942,azau12,Request: Weight Gain Help," 

I suffered from an ED off and on for many years. I currently am on the up stage part (as in trying to get better). I have been trying for several months constantly eating whatever to gain my weight up. I’m starting to be afraid that I am like this for the rest of my life.

I feel like I am stuck at a certain weight, only going down never up. In the beginning I gained a few lbs and did a mini celebration for myself. I am a very private person when it comes to it and I haven’t told anyone about my issues getting my weight up. After gaining those lbs, I have lost it all again regardless of my eating habits (they’re unhealthy. Hello McDonald’s and fast food). I have tried protein drinks, protein bars, I’ve tried different birth controls seeing as they sometimes help weight gain. I’ve asked my doctor who basically tells me to eat more and I don’t know how much more a person is supposed to eat.

I’m not afraid of gaining weight like I was in the past, instead I now have a new fear of losing more weight seeing as I’m already tiny. I feel sick every time I get on a scale because I know I won’t like the result.

So background information: I’m 21, spend an abundance amount of money on food and coffee. I’m not active what so ever and spend a lot of time laying/sitting down (I work a desk job). I eat fast food primarily and majority of the time, I’m not home enough to cook or eat with my family. Anytime I go to my friends or family they tell me that I look great, eat more, or many people wish they had my issue (as in being to eat “whatever I what”). I have gone to therapy and it was not much help either. It is starting to take over my life. I picked up smoking weed to “get the munchies” hoping that would help (it doesn’t)

Can anyone relate to this or give me some advice please?",1551954873,3/7/2019 4:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ayb8a5/request_i_feel_guilty_every_time_i_eat_anything/,10

951,ayb7qb,Request: Guy seeking advice," 

These past few weeks I've found myself starting to have issues again. I struggled pretty extensively with anorexia since I was about 16 but never really realized what was going on or my issues until I was 20. I'm a guy and was extremely underweight until I was 12, then i was taken off adderall and started gaining a lot of weight. My mother wasn't exactly the best. She'd always tell me that I was fat after that, at one point she was forcing me to go to the gym everyday or I wouldn't be allowed to do things at home, despite living a very active lifestyle. From that point I started developing really intense body image issues, mix that with being in a very detached and poor home where there was never food or adults around, I just completely stopped eating. Not with intent or anything, I just felt sick all the time and didn't have money to afford it until I was able to get a job at 17. At this point I was down to what most people would consider skinny, and people would tell me I've lost weight and I look good so I just kind of thought things were normal and that I was healthy.

This all went on until I was about 20, I was living with my at the time girlfriend and things were absolutely awful. I started working out constantly and eating even less, sometimes going literal days without eating. I thought I looked good but at this point my best friend told me she was concerned and that she thought I had an eating disorder. She's a medical professional so I took her words to and diagnoses to heart but just couldn't stop things. By the time I was about halfway through being 21 I was the skinniest I'd ever been since I was a child. It got to the point I had to order clothes online because I couldn't find anything that fit where I lived. But I just kept restricting and working out. I don't know why, there's just this feeling or voice that would push me on and everytime I looked in the mirror and looked smaller I felt better about myself.

Shortly before I turned 22 I started dating a girl and we were excellent for eachother, we moved in together shortly after starting dating and since she has similar issues and felt comfortable with eachother. We started supporting eachother and encouraging eachother to eat more, having a lot of dinner dates, and cooking together all the time. It got to a point we were both pretty healthy weight wise until about December last year.

By then I started having intense depression issues and body image issues with them, she was also having some mental issues involving paranoia and delusions. She ended up moving back to her mother's to be safe, work on herself, and be around professionals (her mother is a psychologist) in feburary. And things have continued slipping down hill much more quickly since then. I've started eating once a day and working out more, counting the calories on everything I eat, and having worse dysmorphia issues. I tried to get back in with an old counselor that was really good for me, but they won't take my insurance. I don't really have a lot of resources, the only friend that knows is my bestfriend and I don't like going to her with problems because she has a family and responsibilities. I live in Alaska which a very masculine and rigid place, so there isn't really any support systems or anything like that around me, especially for men with the masculinity issues here. I know things are getting bad again, and I really don't want them to regress to where they were.

How can I get better?

I'm sorry for the long post, I just don't really know where else to say this or where to look for resources. I hope this doesn't break the rules or worsen anybody's day. Thank you for reading and I hope you have a good day.",1551954747,3/7/2019 4:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ayb7qb/request_guy_seeking_advice/,2

I am relatively slim, healthy weight and play soccer, and she is about the same height as me, maybe an inch shorter, but bigger physically. As of recently it has come to my attention through a mutual friend that she is very self conscious about her weight and it bothers her greatly. She goes through the cycle where she eats near nothing all day, then binge eats a ton in the evening and purges it all at night. We have tried talking to her about it, but she is reluctant to listen because she has tried and it is very difficult to break the cycle and return to health. She feels as if she is less because she is bigger than me. She cannot see a therapy st or speak to an adult for personal reasons.

I’m 18 and have been struggling with restriction and binge/purge for 7 years now. I have also utilized by adhd medication to curb my hunger. I also struggle from depression. I’ve been at extremely low BMIs before but never lost my period.

I was starting to do better but after taking birth control my depression spiraled again. I reached out for help, went to a few therapy sessions to basically be told “you are gone to far I can’t offer you any help anymore”.

I am a full time student and do not have time for outpatient. When I come home from college for the summer I can’t do outpatient as I don’t live near one and I can’t drive (anxiety) and can’t depend on other people for transportation. I don’t think I’m at risk enough for impatient as I am at the low end of a healthy weight. My insurance barely covers my medications let alone inpatient. Too bad for weekly therapy and can’t do impatient or out patient.

960,b2v70v,Request: Restrictive Eating Recovery Help?," 

So after months of battling my disordered eating, fear of weight gain, and extreme hunger, I've decided to give up and just try to eat a lot more freely. However, I've seen conflicting information about whether or not to give into the extreme hunger (vs following a slightly elevated caloric plan). I'm unable to go to a clinic at this point in time, but want to start recovery while I have the courage to do so. I have bouts of strong physical hunger where I start literally scavenging like an animal for food (or I start to breathe heavy and get really physically irritated) but that tends to come and go. I never feel full no matter how much I eat, and no matter how much I eat, no matter what I do, my thoughts tend to trail back to ""food"". And it's nothing in particular, I'm not imaging cookies or pizza or cake or whatever, my brain just goes back to very singular thoughts like ""food"" ""hungry"" ""Im hungry"" even when I don't physically feel so. I could gorge myself until I get what feels like a rock in my stomach and my brain will continue its mantra of ""food-food-food-food"". It's really weird, to be honest. However, I'm afraid I could actually bust my stomach open with that so I'm not sure whether I should give in to it or not.

What form of recovery worked best for you (food wise)? What should I be looking out for? Anyone else have the ""almost all my thoughts are about food or eating"" even when they're eating? What am I aiming for? What brought back your period? Any other tips?

BTW: I never became underweight, but did lose a lot of weight in a short span (6-7 months).",1552987109,3/19/2019 4:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/b2v70v/request_restrictive_eating_recovery_help/,1

963,b2gy0f,Request: Girlfriend Of 3 Years Broke Up With Me Recently And I Think ED Played A Big Part In The Breakup," 

We dated for 3 years. She broke up with me about 2 months ago. We still live together. She said I wasn’t giving her what she needed. I myself have past trauma from a traumatic brain injury that occurred in my childhood. Because of this I have codependency issues, boundary issues, abandonment issues and low self worth.

She was upfront about the ED initially and just started getting help for it when we started dating. I wasn’t hesitant at all and have supported her in every way possible. She has grown so much over the past couple of years and it is a beautiful thing to see.

She says I have been more stagnant and have been a bit stuck. One of her stipulations on moving in with me was for me to finally start dealing with my PTSD and getting therapy. I started doing it, but apparently it was too late and didn’t coincide with her rigid timeline of things.

I have been nothing but loving and respectful to her. I am responsible, I own the house, I never miss bill payments, I switched my work schedule to take care of our dogs.. I am still deeply in love with her. I don’t get what more she needs from me. This has been so hard for me to accept. I was planning on purposing to her this year.

Since the break up in January, her self destructive behaviors seemed to of worsened. She has been more restrictive with food groups, working out twice a day, drinking alcohol which is a ED trigger for her, working out in front of a mirror and locking herself in the guest room anytime she is at the house. For the first two weeks I was so shocked and kept telling her we can work through this.

I do not know a ton about eating disorders, just what I’ve heard from her. I have dated another woman with an eating disorder. It seems in both relationships, they get what they need from me and aren’t willing to stick around for me to get my shit together. I am a healer and love helping others, this may be why I keep gravitating towards women with these behaviors.

I really love her and want her to be happy and as hard as it is for me to say, if that doesn’t include me than so be it. It does make me sick to think about her with other men, but if that’s what she needs right now then so be it. On the other hand, we had a great relationship and it was never toxic. We are extremely compatible. I would do anything for this woman. I am worried I have pushed her too far away by not doing and over doing certain things. It seems like she is putting the breaking of this relationship on me. She thinks she is much better off than she was. I am being very hard on myself about the relationship ending. Yes, I need to work on my emotional maturity, but I have never been more aware in my life. I hope she comes around after she gets some space. I will continue to better myself and we will see how things end up.

I’ve recently started to recover from an eating disorder that controlled me for 7 months.

Over these past 7 months, I’ve managed to hide it from my family. Because I was overweight before, they didn’t take my major weight loss too seriously, let alone comment on it; I assumed they believed it was from sports, as I’ve only recently started doing them.

However, it’s beginning to get worse. My hair is incredibly thin (and before it was SUPER thick). I lost my period months ago.

I need to recover. I’m going to recover. I’m so exhausted with this, and at this point, I’m just saying fuck it — fuck it, I’ll gain the weight.

My question is: how long does it take to see results? When will I get my period back? When will my hair grow back thicker? I’ve started taking hair, skin &amp; nail supplements. I’m not sure if that’s the right choice, but I’m assuming that it can’t hurt.

If anyone who has recovered from this sick fucking disorder has any insight, I’d really, really appreciate it. :) Knowing that my hair is going to go back to how it was before is a HUGE motivator for me, and I know that it WILL take time, but I’m just wondering how much.

As a preface I also have anorexia, but I'm 6 or 7 months in recovery. My gf relapsed several months ago and I asked her to get help back then but she said no. Now she's supposedly getting help at the end of the month, but I think it's too late for that. I have PTSD and seeing her underweight body triggers me and gives me a shockwave of flashbacks from early childhood abuse. I stopped using all social media just so I don't have to see her and be triggered. I am not trying to make her illness about me, and i encourage her to seek recovery for herself and for everyone that cares about her. But, at this point I'm really hurt. I don't think she knows how painful it is to support her through her relapse; I don't think I have the emotional support in me left.

Anorexia is addicting and it's terrifying to be struggling with thoughts I haven't had in months that have only happened after being triggered. And now, the fear is that even if she were to see this recovery through she would relapse in the future and i would come tumbling down as well if i were living with her.

Hello, I have struggled with both AN and BED. I currently am trying to overcome BED. It’s a daily struggle. Scratch that. A moment to moment struggle. Currently I’m on a streak of emotional eating every single day for the last while. It’s been rough.

And I know this is going to sound horrible but, compared to my days of AN, this is so so much worse. Now, I am slightly larger than a good weight for me.

I get dirty looks. I get double takes if I wear something that shows a bit of cellulite or exposes a tummy roll. I have resorted to covering up all the time. Today I wore a turtleneck. It was 76 degrees. I sweat through my shirt underneath.

When I had more controlling and restrictive behaviors, I would actually get compliments. It was awful and alienating to receive positive feedback considering the negativistic attitude I had about feeding myself. But, nonetheless, I was received in an approving, even at times, envied, way. How messed up is that?! One ED is shamed, the other glamorized! Both hurt. And I don’t mean to further the glamorization in this post. The grass is greener, huh. I just miss fitting into my clothes, feeling confident in my skin. When I go to shop now, I look at things and want to shop for the old me, it feels surreal.

A couple of weeks ago, something just broke in my brain, and I’ve been binging/purging pretty much every day. It’s taken up my time and made me feel pretty gross and miserable. Now, I find myself avoiding going to events with food, not hanging out with friends as much, and I can’t focus on any of my last semester of grad school work; my throat hurts and I always feel hungry. I haven’t really gained or lost weight from it but I don’t want to keep doing this and end up gaining weight. How do I even start to break the cycle of overeating/purging/restricting/doing okay and then accidentally overeating again?

Thank you for your help/advice! I have an appointment with a school counselor next week, and I’m trying to get into a mindful eating group at a nearby school, but I just feel like such a failure and want to just be able to eat the number of calories I’ve been trying to for so long.",1552814168,3/17/2019 4:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/b23f4e/request_how_do_i_even_start/,3
974,b23ez4,Request: Do I Have An Eating Disorder?: A Two Year Pattern," 

I go through these period where I binge for like 3 months. I eat so much food, so fast, and after all the food is gone, I still want more. Sometimes I plan binges out, and it’s always in secret. During these periods I typically isolate myself and feel pretty crappy. It’s a combination of binging being fun, having something to do, and feeling numb I think. Then I snap out of it, feel happy and motivated to better myself, and go into this drive of starting over in a sense. This is when I go into these periods of another few months of restricting pretty heavily, with fasts thrown into my week additionally. Sometimes I’m also triggered into this if I see someone look skinny/fit and I feel bad about myself. I’m actually in the low average BMI scale and I don’t think I’m fat at all, but it’s not what I crave. I want to be at the lowest BMI percentage just about to tip into being underweight and skinny enough for my bones to show at least a little. Someone on here said it perfectly: restricting provides me with the same satisfaction feeling of cleaning my room or acing a test. I also go through periods where I eat normally too, however. This has been going on for two years now..

I don’t ever throw up or anything like that, and my restricting/binges are independent episodes of each other which leaves me really confused. Is this considered an eating disorder? What does this all mean?

979,b0y4ru,Request: Worried About My Housemate," 

Hi this is my first post here, I checked the sidebar and don’t think it’s covered, if I’ve done anything wrong let me know.

So a bit of background I live with my boyfriend (22M) and our housemate (23F). When I first moved up here a few months ago she was trying to lose weight, mainly through intermittent fasting (only eating dinner, although she didn’t follow this every single day). She had discussed this with her doctor, I know IF can be healthy (physically and mentally) for some, for some it isn’t. At this stage I wasn’t concerned for her, my boyfriend voiced concern at the fasting but had never looked into it (I had as at times I do it as well but not as much as my housemate does).

She has lost weight since then and is quite happy about it, lately she’s bringing it up quite often in various ways about how much she’s lost/ the clothes sizes she’s gone down/ peoples comments on her weight. She was probably over a “healthy weight” when she began based on something like BMI, and now would be considered a “healthy” weight. It seems like she’s also losing quite a lot of hair lately (beyond what she, and myself, would usually shed over the house).

I know these factors alone don’t point directly to an ED, however my boyfriend and I are a bit concerned, something of a gut feeling. I honestly don’t think she has one, but maybe is heading towards it? I know signs and how to help, but only really when it’s pretty pronounced. Was wondering if anyone has any advice on things to watch out for, or other early warning signs?

Again I hope this is ok, and thank you in advance for any help anyone has",1552554861,3/14/2019 4:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/b0y4ru/request_worried_about_my_housemate/,8

981,b62f6d,Request: I Need Help With A Very Tough Decision," 

I am an elite triathlete and competitive swimmer. I have always trained like crazy in order to succeed, and in turn i am at the top of my age group- train insane or remain the same, right? Well, i developed a serious ED in ninth grade. I was severely depressed and wanted to get back on track, so I began eating healthy and training regularly again. This quickly developed into a strict eating and training regimen that then developed further into an ED. I restricting my eating so much that I lost a lot of weight while already being at the lowest BMI for my height. I was always fatigued and was underweight with no period and hair loss while I competed regularly. Eventually, it became more about the exercise than the food: I would train for hours upon hours a day to cope with my depression and mental health issues. I would swim twice in one night alone, swim during my school lunch break, and even skip class to get a workout in. On Christmas Eve, my local pool was closed and it sent me into a panic attack. I pleaded with my mom and begged until she drove me to a pool in another CITY just so that i could “earn my meal.” This behaviour continued all the way until Championships for competitive swimming in the summer. Due to my unhealthy addiction to training, I was over prepared for the meet. I won my races by entire lengths of the pool and broke records in nearly all of my events. I didn’t care. I wasn’t training to succeed— i was training to be skinny. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I started getting better. Sports took a break for a month and my life felt like it was back on track. Even when they started again, I felt in control. I was able to tell myself that I didn’t need the extra workout, I didn’t need to go to the pool, that I was so much happier without it. I was able to calm the little voices that egged me to train. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, i have recently been presented with an opportunity to qualify for National Championships for triathlon in my country. Of course I said yes right away, but since then i have been downright miserable. I’ve been training twice a day and can feel myself being pulled back into the dark world of punishing exercise. I worry about eating too, so that i won’t get too “fat” for the championships. I get up, run, eat, swim, eat, bike, sleep. I am exhausted and depressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can’t do this anymore. I hate training, I hate exercise; furthermore, I’ve started skipping school again to go to the pool. I am suffocating and am wondering what the point even is if i’m sacrificing my health and wellbeing all for a workout in the pool. Every fiber of my being tells me to quit. I know that I will be so much happier and well off if i retire from my sports, but I have an attachment to them— they have been my life for the past 10 years. Despite this, they are an outlet in which to channel my ED, and I know that if I keep training like this it will take me down a very dark path. I can’t do this anymore. I want to be able to sleep in on the weekends, and spend time with friends, and be able to take only one shower a day. I want to focus on school, and have time for a job, and exercise when I want to, not because I feel that I need to. I want to lead a normal life. I don’t care if i lose my status as an athlete, I never cared about that anyway. I want to get better. I need to get better. I’m one call away from happiness but something won’t let me make it.

982,b5nowr,Request: T1 Diabetic Diagnosed With BED But Not Convinced..?," 

hi,

im not currently in recovery anymore because i felt like my therapist didnt understand my individual experience with disordered eating in combination with my chronic illness. i am very self aware and i know i have a problem. i am a type 1 diabetic so if my blood sugar drops i get a strong animalistic desire to eat. i physiologically cant control this because my cells are starving. its impossible for me to “never” experience low blood sugar as a t1 diabetic. it will happen sometimes, even if im very careful with my medication. my therapist thinks im in denial and has tried to tell me that my low blood sugar eating is a “binge”, and the only way i can move on to the next step of the program is if i stop having these “binges” for a while but having low blood sugar occasionally is part my illness, its unavoidable no matter how perfectly i try to manage it! i tried to control it. when my blood sugar would drop, i’d eat only a little to correct it back to normal and tried to wait it out. but i end up shaking and sweating and crying because the feeling of hunger is so unbelievably overbearing. it was agonizing. one thing i did notice from the recovery program though is that when my eating is extremely disordered, my blood sugar is all over the place. following her regime &amp; eating regularly helped stabilize my blood sugar so my “binges” were less, so she insisted it was progress but i told her its a typical response to eating properly and regularly. it still doesnt mean that my blood sugar wont ever drop again, it will happen eventually but less, so i will still have some “binges” &amp; it means that i’ll never be able to move on to the next stage. i told her that i dont have issues with episodic binging. i dont starve during the day and binge at night. my disordered eating is cyclic, i go months starving, abusing diet pills, and i lose so much weight. then i’ll go weeks eating “normally” or some days overeating, then i’ll feel bad and go back to starving. i have extremely bad self image and i’m never happy with how i look.

is this binge eating disorder? her program only targets binge eating thats in “episodes” not cycles so i’m very lost even if it is BED.",1553593537,3/26/2019 4:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/b5nowr/request_t1_diabetic_diagnosed_with_bed_but_not/,7

I’m slightly above average the average bmi and I have these periods of time where all food I eat tastes... weird and gross. For example, drinking Coke tastes like drinking sparkling oil and eating a burger tastes like eating rotten meat. Just the thought of eating food at the moment makes me cringe.

I don’t know if it’s an eating disorder or if it’s normal. Usually when this “thing” happens to me I can go weeks without eating properly. I already don’t eat much lately and I work out daily. I’m scared that my weight is gonna change too much too fast and I’m fine being a little bit bigger because I don’t really care, sure losing a few pounds would be fine but I don’t care for beauty standards. I’m healthy and that’s all that matters.

I didn’t mention this to the therapist, but despite wanting to be healthy weight, I have this fear that if I keep gaining weight I will spiral out of control and gain a little too much, then become overweight.

I don’t want to look extremely underweight like I do now, but I’m scared I will turn out like the women in my family. They were all small and thin when they were my age, now every single woman in my family is overweight, or obese. When these women compliment my body despite being underweight, I get an ego boost and makes me want to stay the weight I am.

995,b434nh,Request: How Can I Confirm Hair Loss Is From An ED?," 

My partner is currently in recovery from BN but is still struggling with restrictive eating and major body image issues. This in particular is exacerbated by the fact that his hair has been falling out for a few months now. He's convinced it's just balding and bad genes but he is only 20 and I think hes just in denial about the effects of an ED.

Where do we turn? Can he get bloodwork done to confirm nutritional deficiencies that can cause hair loss, and what kind of doctor would he need to see for that? From what I've seen, his hair will stop falling out after a few months at a healthy weight. But I think he needs to hear from a professional what's causing the hair loss so that he can stop agonizing over it.

996,b43475,Request: I Don’t Know If I Have An ED Or What To Do," 

I’m a healthy weight: 20 YO F. I used to be an athlete, and when I got injured gained some weight in sophomore/junior year of high school. I lost a lot of weight senior year literally without trying just because of my schedule, not working out whatsoever but eating really healthy, the same things every day, at the same times (in retrospect, I realize a big part of this was probably eating breakfast at 7am, and dinner at 530 or so, and never eating at night moreso than what I was eating). My freshman year of college, I was so poor that I would go several days without food, and so stressed that I didn’t have the compulsion to eat: I got down to an underweight BMI, also without exercise. It was the first time in my life I had ever felt “skinny”. I gained some weight back when I started making more money, and dealt with my depression.

I work out pretty regularly (sometimes can’t due to my work schedule/school schedule), and eat generally healthy. I’m writing because I think about food literally all the time. What I’ve eaten, when I should eat, how long I should fast, how much cardio I should do. It consumes every waking thought. I get into cycles where I binge, hard. This has been worsened with intermittent fasting, I think. I’ll fast for 24-48 hours, and at the end sit for several hours in my kitchen, doing nothing but eating until I’m physically uncomfortable and my stomach aches. I’ve also struggled with purging intermittently, last cycle being in the summer. I was working full time, and my work environment is very busy and it was easy for me to slip away to vomit. I would vomit even if I had just had the egg white from a hard boiled egg and a little bit of sliced turkey- I couldn’t make myself keep anything down.

I haven’t told anyone about this. The most “triggering” thing is when my boyfriend comments on how he can tell I haven’t been working out or touches my stomach or hips. I worry that he’s feeling to see whether I’ve gained weight, but I don’t know if that’s me projecting or not.

I feel so proud when I am able to fast. I feel so, so guilty when I eat anything. I had a  protein shake and a big kale salad, but then kept eating more and more salad until I felt sick. But that’s the issue: I don’t binge on cake or pizza or candy. I eat really healthy, and binge on healthy stuff, but can’t stop myself from eating, and can’t stop feeling guilty when I do.

I also literally can’t tell what I look like. I don’t know if other people think I’m overweight or skinny. I work out, so sometimes I can see muscle tone (especially when I’ve been working out a lot, which now that I’m writing seems ridiculous in how logical that is), but other times I can’t tell. To me, I look like I have a gut. I constantly feel the fat on my stomach and hips (though I can feel my hip bones easily when I lie down, and can clearly see my ribs when I twist in the mirror. My roommates tell me all the time that I’m too skinny (but they are all obese, so I don’t know).

I get very obsessive about learning about nutrition, trial studies of fasting, benefits of keto, different diets- one of my roommates commented every time she talks to me it seems like I’m cutting something new out of my diet (dairy, meat, sugar, carbs) but it’s transient and I always am getting attached to a new eating style and beating myself up when I don’t stick to it. I’m amazed when I see thin people eating. when I imagine eating as much as they do in a day, I can’t comprehend how they’re able to stay at their size.

I don’t track calories or macros. I’m not actively purging. I don’t think I’m unhealthy. I just don’t want this to constantly be a thing I’m thinking about. When I start getting close to a “breakthrough”, as in “oh, maybe I can eat healthy and when I’m hungry and fuel my body” it’s shut down by “maybe you’ll gain weight”. How do I get out of this? It’s exhausting and I don’t know what to do",1553248018,3/22/2019 4:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/b43475/request_i_dont_know_if_i_have_an_ed_or_what_to_do/,2

999,b3od09,Request: back in a binge cycle," 

My struggle with BED started after I did my first bodybuilding show back in 2017, its been 2 years and I'm still trying to crawl out of this dark pit. The binge/restrict cycle is so insidious and its hard to realize when you are going into a cycle. My symptoms are very sporadic, I can go binge-free for a month/month and a half, then get blindsided out of nowhere by binge-eating. I'm tired of fighting this demon, I wish I would've never done that bodybuilding show. Right now I'm back in a binge cycle after a month and a week binge-free. When you are binge-free you sometimes for get about the unforgiving emotional pain that comes along with the binges.

Here is my main problem; I'm trying to lose weight to get a contract with the Navy. The job I want to do is very physically demanding and the extra lbs is slowing my performance down. I haven't told my Navy mentor about my binge eating but he wants me to drop lbs. Losing weight will skyrocket my performance and I'll earn a contract much easier at a lower weight. So, I tried calorie-counting again, but I keep falling flat on my face and binge HARD. It seems like I can't win with binge eating. In the past two years binge-eating has cost me so much emotionally, physically, and socially. I'm tired of fighting it.

I need help, any advice?",1553159698,3/21/2019 4:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/b3od09/request_back_in_a_binge_cycle/,3
1000,b3oc7p,Request: Is IF leading me to an ED?," 

Hey all- thank you for looking. My job is really stressful and I’ve fell in sort of an intermittent fasting (IF) sort of scenario where I don’t eat at work at all M-Fri and eat dinner when I get home. I eat on the weekends more than one time. I also do one hour of cardio two days a week after not eating before I have my meal at night. I’ve found myself binging lately because “I didn’t eat all day, I can eat what I want.” When I *did* eat at work, I kind of did the same thing (binging.) So not sure if this is better or worse- or if this is disordered eating at all?

Side notes that might give background: Definitely on the chubbier side my whole life. I don’t weigh myself and try to focus on how I feel instead of how I look. But I hate pictures especially taken by other people, but usually like how I look in the mirror, which seems crazy?

Grew up with severe clinical depression and GAD, did therapy pills for almost a decade. Can’t afford to see anyone now, just trying to see if I have an issue at hand or if my anxiety is getting to me.

I’m trying to be healthy and realistic after recovering from the bad mental place I was in about a year ago. Part of my recovery has been based on health, so eating less junk food and exercising more, basically just taking care of my body.

But I can feel myself slipping into bad habits, and even though i’m a healthy weight I’m still not satisfied. Every time I look in the mirror I see a different person. Sometimes they’ll be looking dangerously thin and other times they look overflowing and huge. I’m not even sure what I look like anymore.

Another bad habit I’ve gotten into is feeling good for skipping meals and getting into the “all or nothing” mindset, When I “binge” a little, there’s no stopping me from eating more - in my head it’s all the same.

The warning signs keep coming and even though I see them and notice them and want to stop this before it gets worse, that voice in my head can’t help but tell me it’s the right thing to do.

I have previously told one or two close friends about my bulimia when things were quite bad last time, and they’ve been getting quite bad lately and while quite intoxicated on the weekend I told 3 good friends about it fairly openly. I’ve also hinted that things “used” to be bad previously when I lost a lot of weight that I “didn’t do it healthily” quite openly but not broadly transparent about it.

I’m not sure what happens now. No one has mentioned it and I don’t know if that’s better or worse than I expected. I suppose it was a cry for help and I am not sure what to do now.

1007,b8h2wi,Request: I'm Confused And I Need Help,"Hey, first time in this sub. I'm an 18 year-old dude with BPD (diagnosed) who's been in and out of ED-related situations for almost eight years now and needs some insight ASAP because this is getting out of hand. I just feel like my problem is kind of different from what I've seen here and on other platforms where people can talk about EDs and such and I could really use a little help. I'm pretty ignorant on the topic though, so please bear with me.

Alright, context: despite trying to keep it under control my BPD affects pretty much every aspect of my life, including my eating habits. When I'm feeling ok or going through a mild shift I don't bother too much about it, I just think things such as ""oh that bread has a lot of calories, maybe I shouldn't eat it all"" or ""It's ok to eat junk food as long as I don't do it often"", y'know? Just some stuff every regular person thinks about every now and then.

However, when I'm going through darker, heavier shifts, specially the angry ones, oh boy. I will go on for days and days fasting and avoiding getting food to the point of passing out in the shower and vomiting straight up my own bile because there's nothing else in my stomach and I feel sick. I get obsessed over my calorie intake and change my entire schedule in order to walk for hours to places instead of taking the subway so I can exercise.

But it feels weird somehow. It sucks, I hate it and I just wish I could eat and function like a normal human being, but instead I constantly find myself unable to look at my reflection in the mirror without wanting to die, among other things. I've been severely overweight (2015 and before that) and then I had a major depressive shift that made it the other way around (2016-2018) and now I guess I'm at a medically healthy weight but... I still can't see that? I look at my thick thighs and soft areas with no muscles and want to dig my nails into it until it's all gone. At some point back in 2017 I even had a girlfriend who would bring me food whenever we hung out because I wanted to stay thin for her, she knew I didn't eat when I was by myself and honestly to this day I still barely eat when there isn't somebody making me do it.

But anyway, that's besides my point. My main problem is, since it's all so irregular and random and my mood changes so quickly and intensely, my therapists think I'm exaggerating and that I don't have an ED. While they recognise that I do have a problem, they think it's mostly my nonexistent self-esteem and deteriorated self-image talking, like ""you're not manly enough u til you get rid of those curves"" and won't intervene because I already take too many pills and their services are free (shitty government support or something I guess). I've tried talking to my current friends about it but they don't think I'm serious because they usually see me eating just fine with them. My family is out of question, I rarely even get in touch with them anyway.

So, yeah. I'm pretty lost and confused here. I really need your help because Google search has answered none of my questions so far. I think the main thing I need to find out here is if I have an actual ED or if it's just nonsense I'm making up because of my PD, and if the former is the case, I guess I'd need some kind of advice on what I should do about it from now on to fix my situation, because I honestly have no clue.

Well, thanks for the attention, everyone.

Last year after I became very sick with glandular, I developed very disordered eating patterns and I’m convinced that there was an association. I’ve done a small amount of research and discovered some studies that show an association, but I’m curious to know if anyone else has dealt with this?

But here’s what happened to me personally: So basically after getting sick, I was told to not compete in my competitive sport by my doc for about 2 months, because of the possibility of my spleen being swollen. I was feeling quite depressed at this point, because I was behind in school and feeling weak and very much not in control of my life. I began to have obsessive thoughts around my food, mainly stemming from a fear that I’d gain weight since I couldn’t exercise. I watched hundreds of IF and what I eat in a day videos, and would obsess over my body. I started intermittent fasting for practically the entire day and drinking heaps of coffee as a laxative. I also began chewing and spitting junk food, and would eat dinner as early as possible so I could fast for a longer period. I was painfully aware that what I was doing wasn’t good for me, but I just could not rid my mind of hyper aware thoughts around my body and my fear of food (something I’d never previously had). A couple months past and i started playing my sport again, but the habits stuck around for another 4 months, and I performed badly in my sport due to me being underweight and weak. I played at an elite level, and my under-performance lead to more stress and more restriction till the season ended. I never told anybody throughout, but I slowly began to return to my former self, and I’m fine now (I think). Retrospectively, I feel like glandular/mono was the biggest catalyst for this period in my life.

1016,b7ix1e,Request: Unsure If I Really Have Issues," 

I compete in a weight class based sport, I can stay close to that weight by following an elimination diet of clean foods only, followed by competing and then binging for a week before trying to return to eating ‘normally’. I wake up thinking about binging and I have calorie counted every thing that enters my body for so long now that I’ve ended up trying extended fasting, Omad, keto, 16:8, I believe that my personality traits of absolutism can tolerate absolutely no food or absolutely off the rails eating. I feel like I’m a slave to food and I’m counting down the days until I can binge again.

I never feel full, I gain weight incredibly easily around my abdomen, I possess low muscle mass so I believe my metabolism is poor, I obsess about not being fat and seeing abs and then I eat to deal with the obsession. The cycle continues.

I binged last night after eating clean for a while and now I’m fasting for 2 days so that my weekly calories will even out. My life revolves around what the scale says and I hate myself because I had such high aspirations in my sport and I’ve actually achieved a lot, there’s so much pressure on me to be the next big thing because I’m so young and I think this is what is triggering me feeling ‘depressed’ and having low mood, I’m a college student and I’ve got no motivation to complete my assignments I actually hate my course now, after being examined for the past 4 years I’m sure that the shitty feeling I experience around submitting essays is correlated to not being able to comfort eat to get through it.

I know I should see a doctor or therapist to sort myself out but my life is so ‘easy’, there is so many people out there who have had troubled childhood or issues but I’m so ‘normal’ that I don’t feel like I have the right to call myself depressed or even that I possess an eating disorder.

1018,b6x6zd,"Request: What is ""enough"" to be an ED?"," 

I restrict my calories by  at least half the recommended minimum. I know it's not good and I know  what it does to your body, and I don't care. I don't support it and I'd  try to talk anyone else out of it, but it honestly makes me feel good. I  feel completely fine health-wise, and losing weight this quickly makes  me feel even better. I justify it to myself by taking vitamins and  eating mostly protein (yes, I know). I'm overweight but not obese, and I  plan on continuing until it doesn't make me feel good anymore, or I  reach a weight I'm happy with. I like the control of it. I feel like  this is something I can do that produces consistent results, and that  feels good. I don't purge and my exercise consists of  walking/jogging/high traffic job.

I got down to a healthy weight a couple years ago and gained it all  back because I didn't think I looked any different, so what was the  point? Looking at pictures I want to yell at myself, because I did look  so much better. So I know dysmorphia is a possibility.

That's my current mindset. My question is: I don't think I have an  eating disorder. I don't want to talk to anyone about it and I don't  want to ask my doctor. He'd probably just say 'good job' on the weight  loss. Food doesn't scare me, because I'm in control of it. I don't want  to count my ribs. That doesn't sound like ED. The calorie count sounds  like ED, but that's it, to me. 

Am I lying to myself or am I right that it takes more than just restricting calories, even if it's past a healthy point?",1553865662,3/29/2019 8:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/b6x6zd/request_what_is_enough_to_be_an_ed/,3

She refers to herself as fat, although she is so far from it. I try and tell her that she is beautiful, fit, etc. but nothing works anymore.

Also, she has taken to begging me to insult her so she feels driven to restrict.

1029,bb5vbz,Request: restrictive food intake and BDD," 

I've been diagnosed with anxiety and BDD and need help with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. I've had this for awhile now but never knew what it was called.

I've been dealing with rashes on my face and random hives for the last 7 years and creams from the dermatologists I've seen don't help and sometimes make it worse. The last dermatologist I saw suspected that it was a reaction to something I'm eating or using and recommended I get a food allergy test. I'm a little scared to get this even though it would likely help me actually narrow down what it is that I can't eat officially.

Over the past several years I've imposed restrictive food rules and diets on myself - no sauce, low-histamine, low GI, nickel free, plant-based, gluten-free, even though I'm not celiac. I break out into a rash across my face and random hives but I can never pinpoint it to one food - and I've convinced myself that it must be something I'm eating and if I can only figure out the right combination of good foods vs. bad foods, my skin will clear up and I'll feel better.

I obsess constantly about the foods I'm eating and check my mirror before and after I eat to see if I get a reaction. I throw out food if I think it'll cause a reaction if it's a ""bad"" food on a new list that I find - even if it's a ""good"" food on another. It's to the point where I'm skipping breakfast because I'm scared to eat and then worry about what little foods I do eat and how they'll affect my skin. I feel like I can't talk about this with anyone

1030,bb214x,Request: How can I support my friend," 

She is one of my oldest friends. We have been close for over 8 years. She's always been a bit thinner than her identical twin, but now her twin weighs is at a healthy weight and she is significantly underweight.

I don't know how to support her because she lives 400 miles away from me. This week we were both in our hometown and I got to see her twice. She said that she was good, talks about how she's excited to go see her nutritionist/ED specialist...but it's all lies. She purged last night when I was hanging out with her after eating two bites of pizza (although she doesn't know we know that). She's getting to a really scary place and I'm concerned that she isn't seeing professionals with the frequency needed to improve, is lying to the professionals, doesn't actually have any interest in getting better, and/or is lying about going to the professional appointments at all.

It all feels really hopeless and we just want to see her improve.

More Info...

She was first diagnosed with an eating disorder in May of last year, but she didn't tell any of us about it until 4 months ago. Apparently in May she weighed significantly less than her twin. She was making some progress and got up to a bit less with nutritional shakes and seeing a nutritionist, but she has regressed significantly (past the original underweight).

Her mother (who she has an estranged relationship with) also had an eating disorder. Her twin suspects that she talks to their mom on the phone more than she admits and that their mother is actually giving her strategies for weight loss.

She has been diagnosed as bipolar and is being watched under suspicion of schizophrenia as well. She claims to be taking her bipolar medication.

Her mother is bipolar, but also a terrible person. She sees herself as a reflection of her mom in some ways. There is this element of self-fulfilling prophecy where she subconsciously may think she is doomed to be just like her mother, who she resents.

Her twin lives 400 miles away as well. Our other friend (we were kind of a foursome in high school) lives 20 minutes away and also wants to support her.

Her father does not understand the severity of the issue and has made comments like ""just eat something"". He is willing to help finance treatments in small ways, but I don't think he has an interest in paying a lot. She isn't in a personal financial situation to pay for long term treatment. Both her twin and our other friend's mom (a mental health professional) have tried to talk to him about the situation, but he has not been receptive.

She has a lot of relationship and academic problems that are big stressors in her life, but they are too complex to explain here fully (e.g. she lives with her ex girlfriend and has been in undergrad for 4 years with 5 years remaining).

She openly admits to eating about 2 pieces of toast a day, no longer having hunger pains, purging the toast, using appetite suppressants, and laxatives. But she will tell you this in such an apathetic and nonchalant way. It's really chilling.

She over exercises despite the orders of her ED specialist.

TL;DR: How do I support a friend with an eating disorder when I live 400 miles away?

Update Since I Originally Wrote This:

She has been hospitalized because her small intestine collapsed. Hopefully this will be a wakeup call for her father, but perhaps not.

I have been watching a lot of videos from a girl on YouTube named Rebecca. They have really helped me to understand the kind of internal turmoil that is actually associated with these disorders. I want to share the videos with my friend (they are primarily about recovery, but she is honest on the days that she struggles), but am concerned that it will trigger her further or something.

1031,bb20bd,Request: Is this something I can work towards myself or do I need to get professional help?," 

I've been seriously into fitness for around 4-5 year now, and being pretty diligent and anal about tracking macros and monitoring my nutrition for a good number of those years.

When I first started my fitness journey, I was very skinny and so from the get go I had to go against my body's natural satiation signals and force feed myself calories in order to grow. I've just finished my first real cut (reversing now) since starting lifting and always find myself binging at least once a week. After I have one of these binges, I'm always in regret and try and even out my calories by going super low calories for the next few days - again contributing to an unhealthy relationship with food. I'm constantly thinking about food, wanting to taste food, even when I'm not hungry and always eat to the point of feeling sick and disgusted with myself.

And it's not that I don't realize I'm going to feel like shit afterwards, but that still doesn't stop me...

I feel like the past few years have really damaged my relationship with food to where I can't even enjoy a single cookie, I need to have the whole box, or can't stop after 2 slices of pizza... It's honestly really concerning to me now because my binges and unhealthy eating habits are becoming more and more frequent.

These binges have been more and more common whilst I smoke, which is a habitual behavior I know I can break if I really focus on it and just enjoy smoking. However, this past week has been rough due to stress and relationship issues and I've probably binged 4x in the past week, followed by major restriction or fasting to ""balance out"" the calories. It's evident now that I'm turning to food as a type of numbing agent- sort of how weed actually makes me feel too.

Is this something I can work towards myself or do I need to get professional help? I feel like people won't take me seriously (mainly my family) if I go to the and say I have an eating disorders mainly because I am a male and it's not prevalent around us.",1554773588,4/8/2019 20:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bb20bd/request_is_this_something_i_can_work_towards/,5

Hey everyone,

I’ve been struggling with...I don’t even know what for the past few months. My whole life has basically been having weight loss in the back of my mind; I’m right now the heaviest I’ve ever been, which for my height is normal weight on the very brink of overweight, at least BMI-wise. Starting in August, I tried to go on a relatively calorie-restricted diet, and while I thought it was going okay I always felt guilty for going over the calorie numbers (and ended up not losing any weight for months).

A few months ago, something just snapped in my brain and I couldn’t handle the restriction anymore. This triggered a descent into what I’d probably term bulimia if it had been going on longer: binges/purges occurring anywhere from once every few days to several times a day. I can’t focus on school, I can’t function in normal spaces, the thought of being around food gives me anxiety even though I love cooking/groceries/feeding people.

My college’s counseling is notoriously terrible, and a wonderful doctor at a nearby college has been talking to me about her intuitive eating self-help book for free. I can’t thank her enough, she took the time to go over all the principles with me and answers my questions. I’m so embarrassed to go back and see her because I’ve failed so hard in the two weeks since I was supposed to start trying not restricting/bingeing/purging. I don’t know wtf my hunger and fullness signals are and at this point it’s too late to ask. The whole “take away restriction” thing has been so nice in the sense of I haven’t had to wake up most mornings telling myself it’s a fasting day and then failing (which is really depressing and hard), but I know I’ve gained a few pounds over these weeks and honestly my anxiety over that is insane - I’ve tried hiding my scale, but not knowing stresses me, and sometimes i’ve even woken up from the anxiety several times throughout the night to weigh myself. It doesn’t help that summer’s upon us, and while i somehow have a bathing suit I like, I’m terrified of getting too big for my clothes and shopping for new styles I like is just a really depressing experience.

I’m graduating soon, traveling, and then living at home and then abroad, so it’s stressful knowing I’ll never actually talk to someone long-term about this. Do any of you have any suggestions for somehow just not caring about gaining weight anymore, or how to just stop the binging cycle? I feel like I’m the odd one out where I just have to be restricted forever, and honestly that’s pretty depressing.

He also made some comments about my weight knowing I had an Ed for 10 years. We had 2 kids together so I have gained some weight from the pregnancies. I only had my second daughter 2 months ago. I was not allowed to exercise after giving birth because of my history with Bulimia/anorexia.

I started noticing I was starting to avoid certain foods and now it’s hard for me to eat anything. I have to force myself to eat safe foods too. I thought it was just because I’ve been so sad and depressed and I just don’t have an appetite. I wasn’t doing it on purpose I think I just started falling into old patterns as a coping mechanism.

I know I should be eating but I just can’t bring myself to do it. I think maybe the break up, him already moving on, and his comments about my weight maybe triggered me. At the time I didn’t immediately think about my weight. I think I inadvertently started doing this again as a way to cope with what’s going on.

He tries to tell me to go slow and not hurt myself in the ways I do. I workout excessively and eat little to no food every day. I am upset cause I lie to him about the workouts I do for that day. He says if I’m gonna run do 1-3 miles, I usually do 3-11. If I’m gonna do sit-ups do 100, I do 1000 throughout my day though. I really hate lying to him cause he’s so sweet and perfect but I can’t stop myself and don’t want him worrying or being disappointed/ disgusted by me.

1042,b9p3y0,Request: Advice For A Recovering Anorexic Dating A Girl With Bulimia," 

A few weeks ago I (21F) found out my girlfriend (24F) is recently bulimic. She doesn't see it as a big deal, and I don't think she wants to do anything to change the behaviors right now, even though it's starting to affect her health. I've offered to go with her to talk to her GP, or to take her to the specialized group therapy the university we attend offers. I've told her about lots of resources, but she sort of nods and says ""Maybe."" She's struggled with suicide attempts, cutting, and now binging and purging, but doesn't want professional help. Instead, she wants me to come over all the time when she feels anxious because having someone there is ""the only thing that fixes it."" We go out to eat a lot because she says she doesn't purge after restaurants. It's a lot of pressure when she makes me feel like I'm the only one keeping her from these dangerous habits. All of this would be hard for any partner, but I'm a recovering anorexic, something I talked about struggling with early on in our relationship--before she started purging. Although I'm technically in a healthy weight range, I'm on the heavier side of that and am really struggling with my body image right now. I can't tell her about it, though, because she says she tends to pick up other people's coping mechanisms. The pressure has made me feel out of control and is sending me spiraling--binging and restricting. She's moving away in August after graduation, and I think she wants to continue a relationship long distance but I'm not sure I can, so this is relatively short term. In the meantime, though, what is the best way to support and love someone who doesn't want to get better while also keeping yourself healthy?",1554457301,4/5/2019 4:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/b9p3y0/request_advice_for_a_recovering_anorexic_dating_a/,3
1043,b9alrf,Request: seeking advice for gaining weight and getting over anorexia nausea," 

I have anorexia, I have for years. I’m looking to see if anyone in this chat has any advice for gaining weight and getting over anorexia nausea?

Basically whenever I try to eat I have horrible waves of nausea. Like properly “oh fuck I’m about to throw up”, and sometimes I actually do. My stomach feels like it’s non existent in size, like I’m never hungry? I once went three days without eating anything except cups of tea because I forgot I was hungry I just let so unwell. Then I passed out. It was horrible. I can manage really tiny snacks but never a full meal. I can honestly say I’ve never cleared a plate in a restaurant, not even a starter. And it’s worse at home. I made s lot of food that I like but as soon as I smell it or taste it I can feel my throat closing up and my stomach churning.

Thing is I have no figure. I’m essentially straight up and down especially on my lower half. I have very prominent hipbones and hip dips and super bony arms. Short version is I guess you know I’m anorexic from looking at me before I say it. I’ve been trying to gain weight because it makes me feel really insecure to be so skinny.

So my issue isn’t that I don’t want to eat, I do, I want to gain weight at this stage in my recovery, but I physically can’t keep anything down! It’s non stop all the time, totally psychosomatic. So far I’ve tried calorie protein shakes that are designed to help put on weight but I can barely finish one. I also try having lots of little snacks during the day instead of meals. Lots of fatty food too. I even try pretending (I know it’s stupid but it works sometimes) that I’m starving in the wilderness and this plate of toast is the first meal I’ve seen in weeks and basically just try to trick myself into thinking I’m hungry.

After I eat I always have to sit still and lean back and distract myself so I don’t think about the food I’ve just eaten. Otherwise the nausea stays.

Really what I’m asking is does anyone have any little tricks to help me deal with the nausea? Any hacks that people in similar situations have found over the years? I would just love to gain some weight and keep it on.

1045,b9akdb,Request: Stuck in Binge/Starve Cycle," 

I'm a 21 year old male with no friends.

My friends used to invite me out and I'd say no just so I could binge. It got to the point where they stopped bothering and I haven't had a friendship with anyone in 4 years.

I go to work Monday-Friday (the only place I feel normal) and pretty much fast all day. I hit the gym, come home and have a huge salad and a lean source of protein as my only meal

Once Saturday and Sunday comes around I go crazy eating. I often try to purge but I find it so hard! I'd be bending over with my head over the toilet with my hands down my throat for up to 30 minutes some times. If I fail to purge then I fast for 3 days and do stupid amounts of cardio until I feel light headed.

By the time the next Friday falls and I weigh myself in the morning, I haven't gained any weight so it gives me the whole idea off ""I'm not getting fat, I can afford to do this every week"".

I've completed in men's physique bodybuilding several times and stay very lean year round. I attend the gym 6 days a week and train in one of those vests that reveal your abs and pecks. The looks and questions I get from girls and guys make me feel so fucking good. I have no irl friends so this is the closest I get to interaction with people. I think I'll be lost and have no reason to live if it wasn't for the gym.

This has been a on going cycle for so long, I'm tired and drained. When Monday comes around all I think about is the morning I wake up on Saturday and start devouring junk food.

This is also affecting me financially, I spend roughly $200 every weekend on junk food.

I've tried 3 different therapists and none have seemed to help. I'm starting to get to the point where I think I'm stuck with this forever.",1554370172,4/4/2019 4:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/b9akdb/request_stuck_in_bingestarve_cycle/,5

This depressive episode goes back to January, and it might be the  worst ive ever been in both my physical and mental health. Two weeks ago  I got the closest ive ever been to committing suicide. I went to a high  bridge where I live and climbed over the guard rail. A passing sherrif  saw and took me to the hospital where I stayed in inpatient for about a  week.

But even since getting out I feel like im all consumed by food, what I  eat and when. And I just want the pain to stop, the strife in my head, I  wanna be happy and stop crying so much. My thoughts have got me  convinced that if ending myself is the only way to make it stop that  thats a reasonable course to take.

Hi Reddit,

This is awkward but I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I don't believe I have an eating disorder but my boyfriend has been yelling at me lately, telling me that I'm anorexic. Other people in my life have also made comments about telling me to eat or trying to get me to eat more.

To be fair, I was underweight last year but I gained weight back. Last year I was extremely depressed - it was an extremely hard year for me. I stopped taking my thyroid medication and I just slept. I was very underweight, but I don't didn't think I looked that thin. I lost my period and a lot of hair. I gained weight but am still in the underweight BMI range right now, which I feel looks like too much but I was told by my thyroid specialist that I needed to gain weight once I went back on my medication.

I take my medication every day now, so I'm not sick anymore. But I honestly don't eat much just because I feel like I have no time. Plus, I don't get hungry. I try to eat when I'm hungry. I have dinner, and I usually eat a banana, a protein bar or two, and a yogourt cup at work when I have time. I just started this new job and the girl I'm replacing never took breaks so I don't have much time to eat so I try to eat quickly at my desk. I'm a very slow eater, so it's hard for me to do this.

I also have trouble sleeping, so I wake up too late to eat a real meal before work, and when I get home I eat something quick for dinner and sleep because I am so tired. Sometimes I fall asleep when I get home and wake up around midnight so I make food then and go back to sleep if I can. I don't talk to people much anymore either because I'm afraid of them. I think they won't like me, or that I'll get too close to them and then they'll attack me later when they're tired of me. Or I feel like a burden. So I don't eat socially very often, but I do occasionally. Sometimes with coworkers or friends from my hobbies.

Anyway, I'm not trying to lose weight. I just don't have time to eat or I'm too tired to eat. But I don't know. Maybe my behaviour isn't normal - I'm not sure anymore. But I don't want to be yelled at anymore. I'm doing my best.",1555277051,4/14/2019 16:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bd7ssq/request_are_they_right_and_im_wrong/,5

I know this is a stupid question but any advice or experience or knowledge from any of your subscribers might help me out, I know I can’t post numbers and cannot post directly so I have no idea how to phrase my question so I’ll be honestly blunt about it and let you guys decide what’s appropriate.

I’m short, and small. (slightly underweight to normal weight). I’m not a fan of eating. I have CPTSD and when I have anxiety of other symptoms I just don’t want to eat. The thought makes my stomach turn to be honest. I still force myself to eat though, because I watched my mother suffer from anorexia for decades. On a good day I’m lucky to choke down a borderline low number of calories but most of the time it’s far less.

When I see doctors, they think I’m a little thin but nothing to be worried about and say I’m healthy for my age (33). But I’m worried about calcium and vitamin deficiency and bone loss... or my disgust for food growing stronger.

I started my current job about two years ago, and have the most amazing coworker. She saw right through my bullshit and over time, convinced me to change doctors (my family doctor I had before either didn’t notice my significant weight loss or chose not to comment on it). I had an appointment with my the new doctor last week, and agreed to seeing a therapist. I was honest with the doctor about my behavior because well.. it’s tiring.

However, I haven’t told my husband that I’m seeing a new doctor or a therapist of all things. We haven’t discussed my eating disorder once- and we have been together during most of this time. So I guess my question is.. should I be upset that he hasn’t noticed or does know and just never said anything? My coworker expressed concern about this- because she said that either way it is not good. I guess another question is, should I tell him? It was never anything I thought of until she brought it up to me and made me think about it. My family does know as well but we don’t discuss it.

1065,bc6qxf,Request: Do I need professional help?," 

I’m a teen and since I  entered this phase I’ve been struggling with my weight a lot. I have  been bullied by my peers, or my relatives would talk shit about my  appearance behind my back etc etc. Three years ago, I started caring  about what I eat and lost a shit ton of weight. 

Currently, my BMI is healthy but I feel like it’s not enough because I  still have big thighs, big arms, big belly. For the past two years or  so, I’ve not lost any weight. But I admit the way I maintain my weight  or even lose some is not healthy. 

For example, I will try different diets- keto, eating clean or  intermittent fasting. None of them lasted because I kept binging. The  period for my diet is a few days and binge days a few days as well.  During these binge episodes, I go to the kitchen at midnight and eat  whatever I wanted because I don’t want my family to find out and be  angry at my unhealthy eating habits. I would stash the food packaging  underneath the trash so its not visible.  Also, once I start binging I  just feel so out of control and I keep reaching for food. At that moment  it seems like my only comfort is the eating of food, not the food and  the taste itself. Because afterwards, when I look at other girls  beautiful figures, I start feeling guilty and self conscious once again.  This endless cycle goes on and on that I’m so tired of it. I still  haven’t lost any weight.

I do not purge, but when I diet I count my calories. I restrict what I  eat. I also go to the gym and workout but not excessively because I’m  still pretty weak. Usually, at the beginning of the diet, I would feel  very good and healthy- but afterwards just miserable because I just want  to have snacks. After I allow myself a cookie, the binge episode will  begin again.

I do pretty well with school, I have a loving family and good  friends- my only problem with life is my body. I really want to lose my  fat mass and gain some muscle but nothing has worked out for me. I have  too low of a willpower. Also, I’m aware that I’m at stake of having an  eating disorder, but sometimes I feel like Im not which is why I’m here  asking for help. I’m also afraid that going to therapy sessions would be  costly as my tuition fees are already a burden for my parents. So  should I seek for professional help for my unhealthy relationship with  food?",1555025525,4/11/2019 18:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bc6qxf/request_do_i_need_professional_help/,1

I’m about 5 months  into a new job, and I have a great boss who is a few years older than  me, who rarely eats during the work day, 8am-6pm. We’re in an office of 4  people. She likes to say that everyone knows she doesn’t eat, whereas  I’ve been eating ok for a while now in recovery. 

I’m really struggling with my own body image, and constantly try and  compare my size with everyone I see daily, and I think she’s skinner  than me. I’m very competitive and she’s able to not eat and function  well, whereas when I didn’t eat I felt horrible and my hair was thinning  a lot.

How do I ignore her daily comments on not being hungry and her not  eating, since I know it’s triggering me? Is she ok and struggling like  me, or maybe she’s healthy and I’m imagining  it? I can’t say anything,  she’s my boss!

I’ve started restricting at lunch and not eating any snacks during  the day since I don’t want to be seen eating food. Even when I feel  nauseous and I end up drinking a lot of water to avoid eating. I’m  stressing over eating breakfast and dinner now too. I feel the need to  slim down just in case. I’m supposed to be skinner than everyone else  els in real life.

I’d really appreciate advice and tips, I’ve actually been enjoying  eating, lightly restricting though, but almost at my target weight so no  one knows by looking at me about my past struggles. It’ll be hard to  fully restrict again, but I’m trying so hard to convince myself that I  should and finalize that decision. I just get so much panic and guilt  when I eat and enjoy the food! Please.

Hi everyone,

I am recovering from a restrictive ED and am now weight restored at my usual pre-ED adult weight, which is in the healthy BMI range (towards the low end, but still). Nevertheless, I am experiencing CRAZY hunger. I have slept terribly for several days in a row because I wake up in the middle of night with hunger pangs and images of food crowding my head. I go to bed hungry and wake up hungry. I am hungry after lunch and after dinner. And it's not like I am limiting my calories - I am eating a healthy number of calories each day, with a fair intake of proteins, carbs, fats and fibers. Yet right now I am sitting here at my desk, crying in shame after having binged on a literal pound of cereals because after dinner the hunger was just unbearable and after days and days and days of resisting it I just couldn't tolerate it anymore.

And I am still thinking about food - in fact I am already daydreaming about what I will eat tomorrow.

The ED developed during a period of my life where things were going down the drain, but in the last couple of months it was all going so much better and I had managed to stick to 3 meals a day and maintain my weight. Yet lately the hunger has become crazy and the urges to binge have grown stronger and stronger. I now feel horribly bloated and fat and I believe the n-th relapse is around the corner. I can't stand it and don't know what to do. I am so scared that recently to combat the hunger I have been eating loads of veggies and drinking liters after liters of water and zero calorie sodas, to the point of experiencing very bad water intoxication and nearly having to go to the hospital.

I am horribly scared, I feel like my worst ED fears are becoming finally true and this time I am actually becoming fat. I need help and don't know what to do.",1554975020,4/11/2019 4:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bbxt47/request_constant_oppressive_hunger_post_weight/,6

I’ve always been able to stick to a diet and lose weight. Over the last couple years this isn’t the case and I’ve never felt pudgier and more uncomfortable in my own skin.

I can’t stick to anything for the life of me. Today after work I stopped at Hardee’s against everything the little lady on my shoulder was telling me, just because I wanted to. I grabbed a slider and a curly fry and scarfed it down when I got home. After that, 3 fun size packs of mini m&amp;ms. I’m a fool for thinking I could keep those in the apartment without bingeing them. Anyway, not unusual, I grabbed my tooth brush and kneeled over the toilet to purge it back out. I don’t want to do this. I don’t want the cravings and urges in the first place. And the purging afterward feels good. Like I had my cake and ate it too — got the junk food comfort, but got it back out of my body.

I want to stop the dieting cycle. I want to become a runner. I messed up my knee this summer and any time I try running, the knee gets worse.

I’m seeing a doctor next week for my annual physical and am thinking of mentioning an MRI for the knee and asking about weight loss advice.

I’ve suffered with anorexia since I was 14. (I’m 24). I’ve technically been in recovery for about 4ish years now but I still have a lot of disordered thinking. I’ve also gained a lot of weight within those years and I’ve become very slightly over the weight considered normal for my height. But at the same time I used to be such an active person (I was a dancer) so seeing myself like this without muscle and honestly bigger than I’ve ever been is really jarring and messing with my self image. 

I want to try and lose weight in a way that is actual healthy for someone like me and get me into a healthy and fit body. From all the research that I’ve done, it seems like it’s not really possible. I’m constantly being told to just love and accept my body for what it is.** But if it’s causing me constant suffering to the point of where I’m afraid I’ll relapse I feel like that’s not the best course of action. I always feel better when I feel I’m actually working towards a goal, but I have no idea how to do it in a way that won’t cause a relapse. I’m currently working with a nutritionist so that I can maybe increase my metabolism but it still seems like nothing is working and I’m at a loss

**Other issues I have with the “just accept your body for what it is” mentality is that none of my
clothes fit correctly or look right so I have no confidence about my appearance and I am much too broke to actually go buy new clothes (not to mention how triggering clothes shopping in general is). Also my career of choice sadly relies heavily on appearances and I fear I am actively losing opportunities because of how I look currently. It’s not something I am willing to give up.

I was prescribed Phentermine, and yes it did help, but ultimately I became dependent on it....I got addicted to it and what it did for me. I have since removed Phen from my life.  

In the midst of the weight loss, and the maintenance in these years, I fear during all of it I developed an eating disorder.  I sometimes will sit there and openly admit it to myself, but other times I convince myself I’m not “for reasons x, y, z and etc.”. Is this common with eating disorders?  

I understand I should see someone for this issue, but for those who are dealing with similar things I need to know these thoughts aren’t just me being insane.

Second part of this—I still see the fat girl who I was all those years ago, no matter how many pounds have been shed or the amount of muscle I have put on while finding my passion(?) of training.  But sadly starting to realize my purpose for over training isn’t cause of passion for the gym, or more for the fear of ever getting overweight again.

I can't tell if I'm overreacting or not. To start with, I'm 20F and have generalized anxiety and minor depression (seeing a therapist for them). In the past I've had problems with disordered eating including bingeing, and occasionally becoming obsessive about food intake (not restricting, just tracking obsessively).

Recently, I've started exercising more frequently and snacking less. Nothing too serious. However, for the past week-ish, I've noticed that it's not just that I'm eating less but I feel like I can't eat more. My partner has told me that I don't eat enough and I think they're probably right but I just...don't want to? Other things that make me think it might be an ED are that weight loss is tied to body image for me and I tend to associate ""feeling good"" with times that my collarbones are more visible, when I can feel my ribs, less fat to pinch, etc. However, I'm usually like that when I eat a lot too so I don't know if it's related.  
It's only been about a week and usually when I've gone through periods like this, they end within a few days. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if it's actually ED related. I’m mostly hesitant to say it’s an ED since I actually do eat. For more info, I usually eat about two meals a day and will eat a protein bar and one other snack.

my mom refuses to face it, and repeatedly tells me I’m ruining her life with my eating habits and doesn’t even try to understand what’s going on... she’s cruel and often insults my body and eating habits.

my ex broke up with me because i was causing him too much stress due to my inability to face my mental health, and now I have nobody to help me figure out what to do.

***it is potentially triggering, so please proceed with caution***

i have suffered from an ed for around 8 years now and constantly lurk this and other subreddits/websites, so i don't want anyone to think i'm just a random outsider. i really really really don't want to fuck anyone up, so please don't take this unless you're comfortable doing so.

here is the survey. (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekGyoAbVlDLTj137k97ZSOmN8j_D_LlyvDBkqd42N_37XmaQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

it's 35 questions; most of them are multiple choice but 5 are optional answers that you can type.
i do not ask any questions about weight or caloric intake.
i do ask questions about pro-ed websites (and pro-recovery websites), though.
if you are uncomfortable with a question, it is optional OR there is a ""prefer not to say""/""n/a"" option.

1088,bfneme,Request: How do I start recovery?,"TLDR; College sophomore (20F) with 6 year ED wants to recover, looking for advice/resources that have been helpful to you during your journey. Thank you in advance!!

I'm currently a college sophomore in the US with an eating disorder that I've had since I was a freshman in high school. Over the years it's evolved and changed from habits of restriction/laxative abuse/binging and most recently I only restrict. I think it's been the weight loss, which has been a symptom of the fact that I have trouble eating enough, that's gotten attention of the people around me, and that's made me realize that I need to recover and stop letting this thing control me.

I want to recover, but every time I do I end up freaking out and relapsing harder. My last recovery attempt ended in me losing weight rapidly and sinking to an underweight BMI. I don't want to keep getting worse but it's hard. 
I'm in therapy, and I have the support of my boyfriend. My parents don't know/they know a little and tell me to eat more but they've never intervened. At the end of the day, nobody is really stopping me from getting better except myself.
 
I'm not ""bad enough"" to go through any day programs or do much beyond therapy in terms of professional help since I'm poor and in college. But I feel like I need more resources I can immerse myself with so that I have a more solid foundation for what recovery should look like.

I feel as though I want to recover, but I'm in the ""now what"" stage. Do I gain weight? I'm at a healthy BMI currently. Do I give up counting calories? This always makes me relapse harder and reinforces the strictness of my ED. 

How do I ""start"" recovery?",1555841697,4/21/2019 5:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bfneme/request_how_do_i_start_recovery/,3

1090,bfiu0n,Request: Relapsing and need help,"I began struggling with anorexia when I was 9. I was diagnosed formally when I was 16, and hospitalized for 8 months at 17. It has been a long journey but for several years now (I’m now 25) I have been healthy and well in control of my eating disorder. 

Just over a month ago, my grandfather- who was my primary father figure and male role model- died. His death sent me into a tailspin. It began with a lack of appetite caused by the initial shock and grief, and quickly evolved into restricting to deal with the emotions. A week ago, I began purging again. If I am in social settings or with family, I will eat small amounts to avoid suspicion and then purge immediately after. This is how I know I’ve lost control of the situation. It’s been so long since I’ve been this far gone. There’s been slips, but never like this. While he was sick (for about 10 weeks) I maintained mechanical eating because I knew how upset he would be if he knew that I wasn’t eating. As soon as he was gone, I lost that motivation. 

I am trying to find professional help, but the options are limited where I live, and I feel doubly terrible because despite my trying to hide it, three of my close friends have clued into what’s happening and it’s having a big impact on them as well. I’ve admittedly been self absorbed in this and didn’t realize just how much it was hurting the people around me until recently. 

I guess I’m reaching out here for suggestions. The part of me that’s fully involved in the eating disorder wants to keep going down this path but the small remaining logical part of me wants to get help and turn this around.",1555805013,4/20/2019 19:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bfiu0n/request_relapsing_and_need_help/,1

Hi I'm sorry if my formatting is weird or I'm not doing this right. I haven't been using Reddit for very long. But I really wanted some advice.

I have struggled with binge eating and restricting since I was in highschool. And now I'm in college and morbidly obese by my BMI. I wanted to make a change so I've been trying to lose weight without relapsing. But it's so difficult. I've lost some weight through low carb and counting calories. But it's such a difficult line to walk.

I have to be strict about my calories but not too strict. I have to think about what I eat but not too much. I have to actually avoid situations where I know my trigger foods will be available.

She told me that she needs to tell someone which i understood its getting heavier for her and im telling to tell to her mom but she says they wont understand me and she doesnt trust to doctors too, she thinks they will put her to mental hospital

1100,bjgqvo,"Request: Using fitness tracker to feel in control, now I can't","I've (F,22) had a poor relationship with food for about 3 years, but 2 years ago when I got a new job I also got a fitness tracker to wear on my wrist. This actually helped with my recovery because I was moving so much at my job, I was able to see that I was burning a lot more calories than I thought m. With seeing this, I was able to justify to the voice in my head with the fact that I NEEDED the food going into my body and that three meals a day wouldn't make me fat. It worked well, and I've maintained a weight in the healthy or almost healthy BMI for two years. 
Unfortunately, a few weeks ago my employer decided to enforce that no fitness trackers be worn in the facility. It sounds crazy, but I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me. The numbers that I have counted on for two years are no longer available to me, and I'm struggling a lot. I work 10+ hour days, so just wearing it at home isn't doing it for me either.

Hi I’m 15 have depression and ever since I’ve been depressed I’ve hated my body more. I’ll look in the mirror and see my stomach as big. Along with this I’m growing taller and look lanky and just overall hate it, I wanted to change it.

So around half a year ago I started recalling calories, just to see how much I was getting then after a month cracked down. I aimed for a number easy to get except family makes it difficult. Then I went more and more lower, gradually at first and wanted to go lower but when I tried it was close to impossible with family meals.

I’ve seen lots of things about EDs and part of me just thinks I’m doing it for attention, that I’m purposely doing this just to have an ED. I had the same thing with my depression, I started out just always thinking it’s not real and I’m only doing it so I know I have depression, like a status which sounds really bad because it is and that’s what I thought. That’s how I feel now. I feel I’m just pushing it to have that title almost which sounds so horrible because it’s not something to parade about and why I just feel shit about it. I don’t want to fall into it but at the same time I’m not trying any weight loss diets or techniques because i start it and then have no energy to complete it or the mindset.

I’ve attempted to throw up when I went too high and have a few times but not good at it, it further makes me think as well I’m just pushing myself to have that idea I have an ED and I feel even more shit about it. Yet I’ll look in the mirror and just see my stomach or if I sit down my thighs are huge, arms big and just overall look bad.

I know this posts a mess and it sounds like I’m one of those people that fake it for attention but right now I know my depression is real and how it started out thinking it wasn’t so now I’m worried that’s what’s gonna happen now. If I look it up myself I think I’m only faking it and will do the things it says makes someone have an ED so I do it and I just feel worse yet I still want to drop the numbers.

Ive been uncomfortable with my body for as long as I can remember. My first memory was when I was 5 and a half, and I was refusing to wear a bikini on the beach because I felt like I was too big. I have never been above a healthy weight, but for as long as I can remember I have been anxious and disgusted with my body.
The thoughts have turned into restricting, but still I dont know if I can even call any of this a problem, or if I am just overreacting.
I confided in a trusted friend and she just scoffed and said ""so you think youre anorexic now?"", which to me was calling me big and invalidating everything I felt and still feel.
I see other people who are heavier than me, but I still feel I look extremely big compared to them. Dont get me wrong, I dont look at other people and think I wouldnt want to look the way they do. I hate my body, not theirs.
But I dont know if its body dysmorphia or if I am genuinely just big and am unhappy about it.

What is going on? 

I need some help figuring out what is going on. 
For the past month I've been restricting food where I have lost a significant amount of weight.
I am still eating soup (with a bit of bread) and satsumas as I feel okay eating these. 
Every time I'm eating something I am obsessed with the calories going into my body, I won't eat something cooked by someone else as I can't count the calories. 
Watching my weight drop on the scale makes me feel powerful and happy, even though my cognitive ability is barely working and I feel dizzy. 
There are moments I am enjoying food and the othee night I had a lot of food with my SO which felt great. However it took all of my energy not to be sick afterwards plus I felt guilty. 
Last weekend I had a lot of time off and got drunk and high with my friends which helped me eat, great I thought I was fine. But this following week I've essentially starved myself. I've cried over eating half a can of baked beans because it was adding on calories. I have no problem with talking about food as I've always been a massive foodie (except when I was severely depressed at 16) but I keep telling myself I cannot have these things. I'm at a point where I'm nearly fainting and even though I want the damn food I just can't eat it. 
Today a family member commented on me struggling to eat at our meal and I just had to go into the toilet to cry. 
I don't really understand what is happening to me.",1556208307,4/25/2019 11:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bhae2a/request_post_request/,5
1114,bmfhrr,Request: Today I stop tracking my calories and macros,"I thought that tracking calories would maximize my fitness journey's results. Consequently, I have been doing it religiously and obsessively for the past 8 months non-stop.
Starting with dinner today (which is in about 30 mins from writing this), I'll stop logging calories, 
Why?
I really feel that
1/ given my somewhat OCD/perfectionist nature (I don't have OCD though, lol, just very mentally strict with some things ocassionally), I feel that this was slowly developing out of control, to the point where I am on the verge of (but haven't) developing an eating disorder. I have first-hand experience with friends/family with ED, and I know it destroys lives (beyond just its victim). I'm glad I haven't developed ED, am sympthetic to those who have, and refuse to ever develop it.
2/ I have wasted so much time and effort on it - inputting food to the gram, researching the cooking method before eating it, etc.
3/ I've sacrificed so many opportunities (to make and hang out) with friends and families
4/ missed out on so many good (but healthy) foods. I used to love cheese, but have had periods where I avoided them because of minimum/maximum calorie and macronutrient requirements
5/ It isn't even that accurate. Let's be honest: companies fail in their food labels, you probably don't know your exact TDEE (which is made more volatile due to varying daily activities), and you don't always measure stuff correctly anyways
6/ even if every measurement and bit of labelling were accurate, the actual calories published are just estimates, even for the most basic whole foods like rice or oil
7/ your body doesn't treat all macronutrients the same (beyond total energy balance, a calorie is not a calorie), and doesn't absorb 100% of the macros you eat anyways
8/ it's costly: I sometimes had to go buy stuff last minute because food I already had ready at home did not fit my macros
9/ just more mental freedom really
10/ hindering my gains at the gym: (not applicable to everyone): - for a very long time my obsession with certain caloric and macro intakes have slowed down my progress because I feared I might over/under eat
11/ Lost productivity - I spend my time thinking way too much about meal planning, when I could've gone out and make money, study harder, or just play some FIFA (soccer video game).
12/ Personally, I don't intend to compete in anything professionally (bodybuilding, professional sports, ...) that requires obsessive control of macro and caloric intake; I'm just someone who enjoys physical exercise, wants to get big and strong and fit
13/ I can still look and feel healthy, stay fit, and have decent physical performance when needed (e.g. if I have to help someone carry stuff), and good bloodwork without calorie and macro tracking
There are probably a couple more reasons, but I think 1/, 10/, and 11/ are the most important ones.",1557376182,5/8/2019 23:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bmfhrr/request_today_i_stop_tracking_my_calories_and/,5
1115,bmfhq4,Request: Why is gaining so hard? *LONG POST*,"I’m vastly underweight. Body image plays a role, but I really would *like* to put some curves on now, however right now it’s more of an issue with anxiety and general apathy toward food. I lived in an abuse situation where food was heavily monitored and restricted, and when it was available I couldn’t stomach it due to the proximity of my abusers. Then, due to just being used to eating very very little, I don’t really want to make the effort to go buy and make something if a little snack gets me through the whole day. At this point, eating more than a little bit causes upsets, like that overstuffed feeling - even if I didn’t eat much, or I get diarrhea or cramps, lethargic, irritable, listless. (On the opposite side - I’m just constantly weak and tired and get migraines up the wazoo) I was never diagnosed, but there is a big history of autoimmune and food allergies in my family too, so I may even have that against me. Then on top of it all, the majority of people around me act jealous that I’m skinny, and therefore I think that skinny is desirable. I know my bf prefers them petite. I definitely want to stay tiny and cutesy. But damn I want to be healthy now too, so I made the choice on my own to take charge. 

It hasn’t been working. I got a calorie tracker app and I don’t really know if it’s working in my favor or not. I feel like I’ve eaten so much and shouldn’t have to worry about it for the rest of the day if I log my one McDonald’s burger. Or I feel discouraged that shoving oatmeal, carbs, fruits, and anything I can find only adds up to a handful of calories and now my stomach feels like it CANT eat for the rest of the day. Overall though, it’s shown me just how much I don’t eat, and I guess that eye opener is just good for me to keep in mind. I really try to eat good things like eggs and peanut butter, and I even bought ensure plus shakes, but the majority of my diet is pretty crappy chips or TV dinners. You’d think SOMETHING would result in me gaining weight. I’m not. Sometimes I lose pounds. It’s so discouraging. What’s worse is that any time I do seem to gain a little, it goes to my belly so basically I look like a skeleton banana. The fuck is this shit? I feel like I’m losing my “desirable” shape and not getting anything in return. I work a demanding physical job in healthcare, but when I’m not working - trust me on this - I’m 90% of the time lying in bed. Even being a couch potato doesn’t help me gain.

They are incredibly concerned; however, they do not know that I also purge. Thus bringing forth the question, should I just tell them about my bulimia? They already know half of it. How would I go about telling them?

A large part of my hesitation to tell them stems from another time when I came out to them about my trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and was met with little compassion. Just confusion and “you can just stop, you know.” If I tell them about my BN, I’m afraid this sort of situation will play out again. My parents, as much as they care, don’t really seem to understand mental illness. Heck, it’s a taboo topic in our house. It seems like it would be much easier on the entire family to play it off as stress eating before finals.

Not to mention that I won’t have any privacy if I tell them. I know they’ll take measures to ensure that “it doesn’t happen again.”

Would telling them do me any good? Or would it just be another unneeded burden on them? I won my battle with trichotillomania all on my own- who’s to say I can’t do so with BN?

i know it sounds crazy, but, i sometimes miss my eating disorder. Its something thats almost always in the back of my head and i dont really know who i am without it.😕 
 On one hand it sucked but on the other hand it helped me cope with my emotions. It was my best friend, my security blanket and my form of feeling in control of my life. Sometimes when i feel depressed or lonely or really anxious i end up restricting or purging to take my mind off of the other stuff. It distracted me in a way.
 I just feel kind of lost rn and dont know what im doing with my life. Nothing really feels familiar to me except the ED. its almost sort of comforting in a weird way.

1126,bl58jf,Request: Post request :),"So, I've been seeing my current Psychologist for about a year and a half for management of my anxiety (GAD) and disordered eating ( Atypical Anorexia). She's lovely, and we have great rapport but I've been feeling as if I've been at a standstill with my eating disorder. She's amazing with my anxiety and the anxiety that comes from my eating problems but it's not currently helping with the mentality I've still got. 


So, yesterday I had a first session with a Clinical psychologist that specialises in all kinds of eating disorders. I really, really liked her. She asked me all the right questions, and took me seriously about how badly this affects my life.

The problem is, seeing both is a logistical nightmare.

In my country (AUS), we have a universal healthcare system called Medicare. What that means for Psychology is I get a certain number of sessions a year that I get approx 70% of the cost back.

If I could afford it, I would see both of them regularly and use my claimable sessions on only the specialist. 

But I can't. So I have to choose. 

I'm leaning towards the new one. I want to go see my old psych for a check in maybe every 3-6 months but definitely stop our monthly sessions. 

I guess, I'd like some advice? And maybe some help on how to tell my current Psychologist. I know this isn't specifically ED based but it's.. a big decision that I need to make if I value my recovery.",1557102699,5/5/2019 19:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bl58jf/request_post_request/,0
1127,bl58gw,Request: Calorie Obsession/Binge eating/how to talk to my psychiatrist about this,"If you could post this I would be very grateful. 

I’m 20, female, and “normal” weight (but on the heavier side of normal weight BMI.) I cant stop tracking my calories. I plan out meals and try for a specific daily calorie goal. Everything goes to plan until like 6 PM and I get so hungry from restricting my calories that I just eat everything. I’m talking twice as many calories consumed as my goal maybe 4 out of 7 days a week. 

If I eat ONE more grape I HAVE to record that. I binge eat so much and then record it all in the morning and hate myself. Every time my roommate mentions the food I eat or how often I eat I get very defensive and feel attacked. When he says “ur not fat” or says I’m skinny I get frustrated because it feels like he’s just lying to me even tho he says he’s not. 

I don’t purge because I have a vomit phobia. I weigh myself every single time I go to the washroom. I can’t stop obsessing over being skinny, it feels like the only thing that will make me happy and I KNOW it will make me happy.  I feel like I should tell my psychiatrist about this when I see him next week but I feel really ashamed and disgusting and fat and I don’t want to have to say out loud how many calories I consume. My entire day every day is consumed by how many calories and grams of protein any given food contains and 3 or 4 days a week I walk for a few hours to burn off the extra calories for the day. 

I feel like I should be concerned about my mental and physical health and this is why I’m posting. I’m not concerned about that at all (besides my anxiety and depression which I have recently learned how to work with and manage) and the only thing on my mind is 

1. How skinny I want to be
2. How fat I am 
3. Calories 

Does this sound like an eating disorder or am I just an obsessive dieter?

1128,bl58ew,Request: A view from the other side: Recovered,"  Backstory: I had my gallbladder removed at age 18 to some weird weird complications. So, this has been an excuse while my eating disorder was active. I am recovered now, but below I am offering some contrasting points of view as I'm newly reovered but still have a view of what it was like while active.
  

I suffered from an adult eating disorder around age 23 onwards to 2 years ago, aged 28. I mainly suffered from Anorexia Nervosa, but had a tendency towards Bulimia if I was forced to eat  

With that said I'd like to play out today's events as someone with an eating disorder versus someone who has recovered. Side note: yes, it's possible to never fully recover. I would not consider myself fully recovered, and I understand I may never be, but I believe I'm recovered as much as I possibly can be.  

I am moving to Atlanta in a week, which I understand and know is a huge life change and a prime opportunity for an eating disorder to resurface. I have known that for quite some time, so I've been proactive about it in the following ways:
When I question food I trust inately, I just eat it  
When I've got an event, I participate  
When life throws me curveballs, I keep myself healthy by eating **enough**  
 
So today is my last day in this state that I can travel to Winston Salem NC, my mom's and my favorite place, without being put out distance-wise. I invited her originally, which is something my former, eating disordered self would never do knowing the food risks involved.
  

Today went as following to my eating disordered brain:  
Oh my god  
How do I say no  
I don't want to go  
How can I get sick  
--Googling ways to get sick  
--Googling how to make myself sick  
--Realizing my family has confronted me about my weight, so I can't say I'm sick because they'll worry it's because I'm *literally* dying  
Look at the menu  
Everything is scary. Everything  
Who knows what they put in this shit  
Calories must be off the charts  
What can I order that is small but looks like I ate a lot?  
What can I order that may be easy to get rid of later?   
What can I order that I can say I don't like??  
What's the quickest route home?  
Drive separate  
Find a way to exercise today, whether it's waking up at 3 am or not.  
Why does today of all days have to be a day to go out to eat?  
Why?  
Why can't I just say no?  
--Looks at sodium counts of lower calorie foods cause I couldn't stand to see my weight on the scale inflated whether superficially for one day or not  
ETC. You get the point, you understand, the past me is you, or was you  


Today I went to Winston Salem with my mom, which is a big outing for us because we live in a small town. We went because it's my last week here and I'm moving to Atlanta. She wanted me to go to Reynolda Village to see the house because I liked the Isabella Stewart Garden so much in Boston. She said it was comparable, so we went.  

That's (almost) where the thought train ended. Nothing more. I mean it, nothing more.   

I knew she'd be hungry for lunch even though I brought her breakfast. Of course I knew that. Winston Salem is about a 40 min drive for us. So I knew we'd get lunch but it wasn't on my mind. I could find something I wanted if we resulted to eating out.  

We walked around Reynolda Village. It was too hot for my liking. I didn't ant to walk around much because of this. 3 years ago I would've enjoyed this, because 84 is a perfect temperature to someone who has no body fat. Someone who cannot get warm, who has ice for bones. Someone who despite layers of clothes still feels cold in 70 degree weather.    
Today, it was too hot, and in fact I rejected the ""chance"" for exercise before lunch to explore the grounds as much as I wanted to. But I did exactly what my mother wanted, we went wherever she wanted to, we walked, we ran, I didn't think of it as exercise.   
Lunch came around 1 pm. An arbitrary time to my recovered self, but an important time to my disordered self.  
My mom ordered the turkey sandwich with bacon and crab soup. I ordered a cobb salad, because I'm temporarily pescetarian for ethical reasons, nothing more.  

I tried her creamy soup. It was fantastic.   
I tried her sandwich without the meat. It was also fantastic.  

That's as complex as I can make it. Honestly, that's it.
I hope you all get help and get well. Life on the other side is good. It's possible, I thought it wasn't when I was sitting on the floor at 3 Am knowing I was sick and needed to eat with a single peanut in my hand, crying over the fact that I could not put it in my mouth  
But it is possible

Dashing into my teammate’s room. “We have to go to the hospital right now. It’s serious. Can you take me?”

Nine years. High school. University. Collingwood, North Carolina, Buffalo, Toronto. Four coaches. Scars on my hands. Wrappers in my jacket, the car, my backpack, anywhere I could hide them. Toothbrushes, always toothbrushes. Until the surgery. Then I had to find a different method.

Relationships severed. Injuries. No law degree (although that’s for the best). 5 drinks the night before my first marathon. Why not? I drank every night. 

Don’t you know alcohol is the best way to numb hunger?

The first two miles of the marathon my anxiety was so bad I could barely move. But I ran 2:59. I placed second. It doesn’t matter if you’re successful. Everything is fine if you’re successful. 

It took me two months to confess to my therapist. “What were you thinking?” she said, “I wasn’t.” 

And I wasn’t ready.

I wish I could tell you I woke up one morning and thought, “This is it. I’m done.” But it wasn’t like that. It isn’t like that. 

It’s quieter. Slower. 

Then there are the moments when you realize what you’ve missed. Simple things, like breakfast dates and road trips. 

And things that are harder to swallow. Things you wish you could take back. 

But you can’t. And that’s the point. 

There is happiness too. Grief and happiness hand in hand. 

That’s why you keep pushing forward. 

At eleven I wasn’t ready. Counting calories in my diary, doing sit-ups in my room. By sixteen I was bulimic, and anorexic at twenty-three. 

I wasn’t ready.

Until I was. 

This is twenty-five. This is recovery.

I cry a lot now and I feel like garbage because my stomach is bloated all the time due to gut issues. When I see myself bloated like this it makes me cry and when I think about how fat I look, I cry.

Sometimes she sounds very committed to this goal other times I see it fall away because she just has so much going on. I want to be supportive of this change because I want us to both be healthy and taking care of ourselves. I also don't want to do anything that would derail her progress or make her feel bad.

1143,bp3ayg,Request: What to do now? Relapsing HARD.,"I’m 30, been struggling with disordered eating on and off since I was 15, officially diagnosed with atypical anorexia 2 years ago which has now morphed into a diagnosis of AN-R (or b/p depending on who you ask—I don’t binge but have abused laxatives in the past).

Anyways, I was discharged from my last “higher level of care” admission in October. After 3 trips to res, PHP, and IOP, it felt GREAT to be back fully in my life and just working with my outpatient team. Things felt stable and manageable for the first time in a while. Yes, there were some ups and downs but my general trajectory was good in terms of symptom usage—mentally I’ve been an escalating disaster. Horrific body image and anxiety. About a month ago, it all became intolerable again—started slipping back into symptoms and falling into old patterns really quickly. This time though, I’m VERY aware of where I’m at and that this is very quickly getting out of control.

My team is starting to give me the “you really should be considering a higher level of care,” “you know it’s not ethical for us to continue treating you if you continue to get worse” talks. I just feel very strongly that more treatment isn’t what I need—I know the skills, I know what I need to be doing, I know I can complete meals when that is literally my only job. I’m really good at playing perfect patient and really bad at keeping it going when I’m back in the real world. My team knows this and, for the most part, agrees that having me step back to PHP or Res/IP will stabilize my symptoms but likely not help long term but IOP, while a good balance of being “in my life,” is historically, a surefire way for me to end up back in res/IP within a few weeks. 

I had a rough weekend, I have therapy and my dietitian tomorrow. I know this is going to come up and I just don’t know what to think/do at this point. I’m trying my hardest to just stay on track with my meal plan but I just can’t. I feel really alone in all of this and like my team has kind of just given up on me—I’m just too difficult.",1557953148,5/15/2019 15:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bp3ayg/request_what_to_do_now_relapsing_hard/,9

1147,bnxnvr,Request: Post Request: SSRI vs. Proper-Nutrition (Need Advice/Insights),"Hey All,

So, I have a lifetime history of OCD/Hyper-Sensitivity, along with GI-Issues. In-Short, this has caused me to develop an Eating Disorder NOS-Type. I typed up a little summary of my history with Antidepressants, and I am looking for advice or support/stories to help push me towards what might be the best path to take in my recovery. I feel very lost, and kind of frustrated that I'll never get back to feeling like ""myself"" again, without the meds I grew into a man while taking.
​
Main Issue
Being off the meds, currently, leaves me with a lot of anxiety about eating “more.” Yet, going back on meds, and suffering the side-effects, just to “get over the hump” until the proper-nutrition begins to ease my anxiety/depression naturally (then taper off, again) seems to be kind of pointless. This is where I think that using supplements, and a strong support system (recovering on an outpatient basis) would help.

History
Placed on Paxil @ Age 10 (5th Grade, 2001)
Took from 2001-2009 @ 20mg (Grew Identity/Developed as a Young Man on the Meds)
Came off “Cold Turkey” in Fall of 2009 for FAA
Developed ED Fall 2009-Spring 2010
Back on Paxil @ 20mg Spring 2010 &amp; Recovered
Relapsed Winter 2010-2011 (While On Paxil, SAD Played a Role in Relapse)
Recovered Spring 2011
Stayed on Paxil @ 20mg Spring 2010-Fall 2013
Tried 2-Week Taper &amp; Switch to Lexapro (Fall 2013), Increased Anxiety
Back on Paxil @ 20mg (Fall 2013)
Paxil “Poop-Out?” (Winter 2017)
Began Slow Paxil Taper 20mg&gt;10mg&gt;5mg (Spring 2017-Fall 2017)
No Medication (Winter 2017-Spring 2018)
Attempted Pristiq (Spring 2018), Increased Anxiety
Back on Paxil @ 10mg (Spring 2018-Fall 2018)
Hospitalized for ED Issues, was tapered off Paxil 20mg to Prozac 20mg (Winter 2018)
Prozac caused lethargy, loss of appetite, GI, flu-like symptoms.
Back to No-Meds (Spring 2018)
Attempted to Re-Try Paxil @ 10mg, Planned to Return to 20mg
Experienced Awful Side-Effects, this time (flu-like, upset stomach, allergies)

Random Thoughts &amp; Questions I Have
Having History of OCD, GI-Issues, Hyper-Sensitivity...What is my Best Move?
For My Malnutrition, Try Food/Proper Nutrition 1st (as opposed to an SSRI?)
Will I find my identity/”old self” again without SSRI? Is it possible?
I'm now trying a Multi-Vitamin, Natural Anxiety/Depression Supplements (Herb-Pharm, got on Amazon), How Long for the Effects to Work?
What is the best way to get meal support, from others (loved-ones, friends) when you feel you need it?
I feel lost, what should I really do? Should I try Paxil yet again, but try 5mg this time and sloooowwwwwly build back up?  I am so stuck...

1148,bnkh1t,Request: do I have an ED,"I’m a teen, always had body issues and have been for a few months tracking calories then going lower and lower. It’s hard with family to get a low number so I would start to exercise at night sometimes to burn it off when it was too much. Then one day I tried throwing up and it felt really relieving, so I started doing that when i ate a too large of a meal. Now today I will try get as low as I can and usually duck out to puke some up, at night then I’ll do sit ups to get rid of more excess ones.

Personally I just think that I’m faking it, whenever I look up peoples stories for example I sort of want that, to be worse with it and push worse but that just leads me to believe that I am faking it for the title almost which just makes me feel bad thinking of something so bad in that way.

1152,bmwg1j,Request: could this be some kind of ED,"hi everyone, it's one of those days where i feel unreasonably shit and figured - why not post here. disclaimer though that i have a bunch of mental illnesses like depression and body dysmorphic disorder so maybe its just the latter, hence why i'm wondering 

ive gone on a pretty restrictive diet (on and off .. i lack discipline) a while ago bc i was so fed up (pun not intended) with this hatred i felt about my body and the guilt and disgust sometimes (i dont even remember), due to how much i ate (i believe it was mostly a way to cope with unpleasant emotions; fill the void) 
seems like i successfully lost weight or body fat or whatever and thats great! makes me feel better about myself 
of course i feel like its not enough but its complicated and heavily linked to other things as well 

this.. whatever it is .. acts up quite bad lately from time to time (every few days?) 
its like a wave of sadness hitting me, a deep sudden sadness about my body in terms of fat, lack of muscle etc. and about what i ate or didnt and what i would or could or not and that i didnt work out and how do i make up for it i will not improve unless i follow a routine i cant keep up because im so lazy and undisciplined and weak
they pass as they come though, sometimes unannounced and sudden
but in the moment im spiraling 
i realised i am quite fucked when a binge that i dont even know can be classified as a binge - i sometimes ""binge"" (or did in the past) to ??punish? myself - actually made me cry. i dont think ive cried before bc of food and having lost control so bad and even pushing that ""punishment"" to the point i felt so physically sick that vomiting seemed like a good option (succeeded to not do it though!!), i felt **really** awful that day
so i probably swore to myself: never again, starting tomorrow i will do way better
now, keeping up the low calorie diet made me generally less hungry and cravings are very manageable on good days
but here comes a weird pattern: i have a serious sweet tooth. most if not all cravings are for sweet things. i might not even have serious savory cravings
so, when watching my caloric intake, on bad days i fill up mostly (if not *only* on even worse days) on sugary food. of course this easily leads to going beyond my intake ""limit"". often that leads to guilt and when i ""binge"" to shame as well (and the sorrow is likely to kick in)
on days where i have the energy and motivation or am desperate enough, i make up for those unfortunate instances by working out (which leads to other problems like missing sleep) 
i recognise thats all far from ideal and i'm working on it to not let it, whatever it is, control me and on good days that seems to work. however with my changed appetite i sometimes am not even hungry (which is nice but also not?) but part of me trying to be in control of this fucked up thing is having (semi) regular meals, a minimum of caloric intake (paired with working out because even though i'm very glad about the weight loss i'm also terrified of muscle loss), etc. but sometimes its almost forced
during the past few days i felt like snacking, just that ""craving"" feeling, but not actually for eating anything as in 'i want this specific snack now' but rather just for the sensation/occupation of chewing on something

even when im in control of what and how much i eat i am terrified of slipping. i dont want to go back to bad (worse) habits of all kinds

for the sake of my own mental health i need to be in control of whats on the menu/plate
meaning i really am not a fan of eating at a restaurant, getting takeout, fuckin festivities, etc.

i get annoyed when people around me snack

and supermarkets make me mad with the products theyre aggressively advertising (a.k.a. ""food"" i avoid like hell) 

when someone tells me how much of x (food i dont consume) they had i immediately think of the calories and go WOAH WTF O_O (internally of course) 

i generally am shocked about how much some people consume a day

the irony is that sometimes i think ""i would never eat that"" but ha, then at some point not much later i ""binge"" on that or similar shit

im pretty sure this is just the dysmorphia but i have such a distorted view of my body, lately it got so bad i couldnt take it anymore so i took confronting measures in an attempt to de-distort my own view, which made me realise i actually am not that ""fat"" as i think or feel i am; even though i know that now i still dont really believe it and it feels fake most of the time
now i frequently check my body in the mirror/on reflective surfaces 

i am terrified of gaining weight in the wrong places
and i regret missed workouts so much
im struggling to find the balance in eating enough to get some strength and possible muscle definition out of working out and not making my weight control obsession take over

1153,bmwfze,Request: Post request: I’ve lost control of my health and eating habits,"I’m eating one meal a day- or more accurately, I’m eating once a day and it isn’t enough food to qualify for a meal, but more than a snack. i wait until evening to eat. Tonight I had some pieces of sushi and a slice of wheat baguette. I only drink water and tea. I have horrible insomnia, so sometimes late at night I’ll get bored and have an individual-serving bag of popcorn. 

I am still gaining weight. I tried desperately to lose a lot of weight last year, and I did by eating a lot less than normal, but now that weight is coming back, though my eating habits haven’t really changed. i am disgusted with my body, and am wearing clothes a size or two too large to hide it. I don’t want to go outside. I don’t want to be looked at. Food disgusts me, and I generally eat because I am cognizant that if I don’t, I will die. 

Recently, I have opened up about my eating to therapists. As a kid/teen, i ate normally but I could not gain weight, and many doctors were convinced then that I had an ED. Now that I am a “healthy size,” but am not eating, no one thinks it could be an ED. She is not a very good therapist for other reasons, and I’m looking for a new one, but I was very embarrassed about opening up about my problems with food and being told I am fine. 

I am seeking some advice because recently my health has taken a major turn for the worse. My symptoms match with rheumatic autoimmune/connective tissue disorders, but my blood test results are not supporting a diagnosis. I have not told my general doctor about my eating. My psych have told me I am normal, and I am gaining weight, so I didn’t think it was necessary. However, it has recently become obvious that I’m losing a lot of hair and have grown a lot more of kind of a peach fuzz. I did not mention these to my doctor - frankly I have so many symptoms that I forgot to mention that one. I am wondering if any of these symptoms correlate with malnutrition. I am wondering if I should call my doctor and let her know about my eating - even if I am gaining weight rapidly. I told her at my appointment on Tues that I have a small appetite, but that’s not the whole truth. 

What would you do? Do general practitioners take this kind of thing more seriously than psychological professionals? Do I not really have an ED and am just making uneducated guesses? I would love some advice from this sub.",1557482703,5/10/2019 5:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bmwfze/request_post_request_ive_lost_control_of_my/,1

1155,brmnov,Request: Do I have an ED? Where do I start?,"Hey all. 

I have no idea where to start with this because I have no personal experience with EDs, but my SO has a family member that battled with bulimia and he has concerns. I honestly am not sure if this is a physical issue or mental. 

I have days where I can’t put on any of my clothes without crying because I look horrendous in ALL of them. My boyfriend will try to help and pick out outfit combinations and tell me how great I look, but I can’t get passed out bad I feel. He has expressed concerns about me having body dysmorphia and maybe I should look into help for it. All of the other days I feel okay, not great- but I can put on clothes without crying.

Recently, within the last 2 months, I’ve been vomiting after eating Morse often than not. At first I just thought maybe my diet hasn’t been the best and my body is just trying to tell me to eat better. I did a juice cleanse, I watched what I ate, I was very restrictive and obsessed with what I ate to try to pin point the problem. I avoided foods that I had eaten before throwing up and eventually figured out it’s really not anything specific.

This came on  at a time when I wasn’t experiencing any stress. I had problems when I was 15 with being so anxious I would throw up all of them time and eventually had to take anti-depressants and anti- anxiety pills. I’m 26 now. I’ve learned to cope with my depression and overcome the episodes. While in the middle of this, I’ve had some family and relationship problems,  but I’m finding that they aren’t bothering me much, so this isn’t anxiety induced. At least it wasn’t at first. 

It’s been ruling my life these past couple of months. Recently, I’ve found myself overeating. Not because I’m emotional or anything. I just go to grab some fast food and instead of just ordering what I usually once, and know will feel me up, I’ll order more and try to eat it. Even if I’m full. Then immediately after I finish, I have to vomit. Where I’m torn, is this isn’t a conscious “oh shit, I just ate all of this food. I need to get rid of it” response. I just eat, then I get up and go throw up- it just happens. I just don’t know what the signs are to determine if I need to see a PCP because I’m just having stomach problems, or if I need to seek help from a mental health professional to start working through this.

Sorry for all of the information. I just do t know where to start and it’s really starting to effect my personal life. I appreciate any thoughts, advice and support.",1558518095,5/22/2019 4:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/brmnov/request_do_i_have_an_ed_where_do_i_start/,2
1156,brmnd4,Request: post request,"Has anyone else had this experience at the doctors weigh ins? 

I tend to avoid any doctors appointments and a large reason for that is that I am afraid of getting on a scale and being told my weight. The last time I was told my weight at an urgent care visit I sunk back into old patterns for weeks. I no longer have a primary care doctor and as such all the doctors I see don't know about my past ED struggles, and are all usually for temporary sickness and non ED related concerns.

Recently I realized that I could just ask nurses not to tell me my weight, and to let me go on it backwards. This has been working and helped relieve some of the stress of going to the doctors and now I've been going to more appointments when I need them. But still nurses keep doing something that really bothers me. The last 2/3 times I've asked to go on backwards and not be told my weight I get comments from the nurse like ""girl don't worry you look great!"" or a nurse today who said ""you teeny, I'd kill for your weight."" I know they're trying to be nice but it is really triggering for me to have my weight commented on especially when it is the absolute last thing I want to think about. Even comments about weight loss just make me think of my last purge I wish people would understand that it isn't appropriate to comment on a stranger's body. I feel like it should be a given that if someone is asking to not even hear about it it is a subject that makes them uncomfortable and I don't get why only one nurse took the request and then never mentioned it again professionally.

I was hoping someone else would understand this predicament cause none of my friends understand when I get upset by this, they just think of it as nice when really to me it is positive reinforcement for relapsing and weight obsession.",1558518017,5/22/2019 4:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/brmnd4/request_post_request/,5

I recently got out of a relationship and wasn’t happy with my self image so decided to cut down my food portions and lose weight - I have a heart condition that limits the amount of time I can exercise so figured this would be the easiest way to lose weight. Since I started losing weight, I became obsessed with counting calories of my meals, skipping meals and going days without eating. Every time I reach my ‘goal weight’ I still don’t feel happy with the way I look and continue starving myself to lose weight. Every few weeks I just get too hungry and will binge on excessive amounts of fast food which makes me put some weight back on and begins the cycle again.

I just found out my teeth are in trouble when I went in for a cleaning. My dentist asked if I have been throwing up a lot. I told him yes and he said if I keep doing it my teeth are going to go downhill at a faster rate.

I used to eat a lot as a kid and basically it’s a trait that all my relatives have associated with me. If I go to an outing and don’t eat more than two plates they encourage me to eat more or will say something that makes me feel guilty so I eat more. I recently saw a counselor and with the help of my boyfriend I’m going to try to stop over eating which is also making me throw up. He had an idea to get me the appetite suppressant lollipops and that we’d start a portion control for my meals. After I eat a reasonable portion I’ll take one of the lollipops to hopefully suppress appetite after eating until my next meal for that day. I talked to my counselor and she said she doesn’t recommend it because she thinks I may go from binge eating to using the pops to not eat at all but if it’s what’s going to help me in the beginning that I can try it.

I want to see if it’ll work because I can’t discipline myself. Has anyone tried any appetite suppressant for this? Did they work?

I have been trying to lose weight (not overweight but also not on my weight goal) and being healthy. However, there is something I cannot control. When I say I am addicted addicted to pizza it usually is taken as a joke.

But the fact is, there are days where I REALLY need to eat pizza, always at the end of the day. I try very hard not to buy or eat pizza, but when I don't, I end up eating A LOT more of other stuff and always feel unsatisfied or never truly full. The next day, this urge is still real or worse, and I always end up buying pizza and eating too much, feeling kind of sleepy afterwards and physically and emotionally bad.

I feel stupid by posting this, but I worry because I can't seem to control this urge and I feel like I'm throwing out the window all efforts to maintain healthy eating habits and a weight I feel good with.

Could this be considered binge eating? Either way, I am looking for opinions and advices because I've tried everything (calorie counting, money savings tracking, drinking water, chewing gum or smoking helps momentaneously but not on the long run, extra exercise as ""punishment"", even threw away the pizza once after feeling nauseous thinking I'd learn my lesson, but nope)""",1558259784,5/19/2019 4:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bqf6s7/raequest_could_this_be_considered_binge_eating/,4

I’ve been an adult for .. a while. As much as i empathize and sympathize and cry for the young girls who are in the throws of it with no one to turn to, i’m fighting a 12 year battle.

There are tips and tricks galore at the hospital. Coping skills and nurses and drs. 12 years of those tips and tricks haven’t done much for me. Having pro ED family/ friends doesn’t help much either...

hospitals won’t do that. the last thing i’m about to do is text my only recovered friend and ask her to give me a “reality check” bc i’ll be ripped to shreds, (i’m okay w they. give me the truth) but it’ll trigger her immediately.

In the past couple of years I’ve been noticing a change in how I want to eat? My sophomore year of high school a friend of mine helped me to overcome a lot of eating stigma I had with anorexia. I just graduated a 4 year college, so it’s been about 5-6 years since I have been actively anorexic, but I feel like I’ve been tipping closer to stress eating in the past few years instead of restricting. That’s a whole other sort of thing that upsets me but it’s not really super relevant.  Anyway, sometimes I get cravings for things and I refuse to eat anything other than that specific food or foods. Sometimes I don’t know what the craving is for, I just know I want something? It almost feels like I’m craving a food I’ve never had? I don’t want to eat anything other than that “craving” food or something that is “acceptable” in my brain, not even my favorite foods. I love pizza, but lately I’ve been refusing to eat it, it’s become “boring”(not really sure how to describe it, it’s not really “boring” it’s just, overdone or something??). I’ve been stuck the past few days on chocolate, raspberries, and spinach-artichoke dip. I don’t want to eat anything other than that (separately though), and I just want to eat tons of that. Because of other issues I can’t get out of my house and go get myself food, so there isn’t a way for me to get these foods or make them since the ingredients aren’t here? So I’ve been pretty much exclusively eating chocolate cereals and any old chocolates I can find now that I’ve run out of spinach-artichoke dip. I have no idea what causes this? And it seems like this happens semi-frequently, but with different foods. Sometimes I refuse to eat anything that isn’t specifically Little Caesar’s Pizza, or a specific brand/style of food? Sometimes I also will get said food and eat a ton of it over like, a week, as per the “craving”, and then when the craving goes away I’m mostly sick of it and I can’t eat it for a while even if it’s a favorite food. Rationally, I want to be able to eat normally, and just eat things that I have available, but its a really hard sensation to overcome and I have no idea why or what it is? I haven’t found any recourses about it and I don’t know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any help or advice is wonderful! Thank you so much.",1558994983,5/27/2019 17:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bts2x7/request_only_eating_specific_foods_at_certain/,2
1179,bts1ji,Request: any advice?,"could you post this for me please? thank you so much. 


Just a little backstory. I suffered with anorexia, which almost killed me, from the time I was 11 up until I was about 18-19 years old. I’m 21 now. I’ve gotten to a point in my life where I wouldn’t say I’m completely good, but I’m healthy and I’m okay with that.  I’ve been in a committed relationship for a little over 4 years now. We share a house, a car, basically live just like a married couple. The past few weeks, my significant other has noticed his pants getting a little tight. He keeps complaining how fat he is, how disgusting he is. He’s been obsessively counting calories and keeps bugging me about getting a scale. When he first brought up the calories, I politely let him know I would rather not hear about that because I have trained myself to not pay attention to calories anymore and it can be really triggering for my eating disorder. They really upset me when I start to think about them. He shouted me at while we were in a restaurant that “he has an eating disorder too and I shouldn’t make everything about me.” Fast forward to now, he has an app on his phone and tells me how much every single food item is worth in calories. I can’t stand to think about, it turns on this panic mode in me. He keeps bugging about getting a scale which I CANNOT have in my house. I will weigh myself compulsively and that is so detrimental for all the hard work I’ve done for myself. He asks me all the time “where can he weigh himself??” I have expressed all of these feelings to him, but he always gets upset and thinks I’m just making everything about me.. I support him the best I can, I try to make him feel as good as I can, but I feel I can only handle so much of this.. does that make me a bad person? I feel like I’m at my wits end. I have nobody to talk to and I really don’t know what to do. I can’t leave him. We’ve built too much together and I’m not in a position right now to do that. I also don’t want to leave him over this.. I love him with all my heart, but I’m struggling right now and I have no idea what to do.",1558994764,5/27/2019 17:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bts1ji/request_any_advice/,3
1180,bts107,Request: ED getting worse despite things going better in my life,"Last autumn/winter I went through a very bad Anorexia relapse, and I also had a very brief stint with classic purging Bulimia. I lost much weight very quickly. The relapse coincided with a very dark period of my life where everything was just going down the drain and I was extremely depressed and lonely, to the point of having oppressive suicidal thoughts.

My therapist repeatedly said that in order to fix my ED I had to ""fix"" other areas of my life first, because my ED was a way to control and cope with all the negative emotions I was facing and if I managed to control them, then the ED would simply fade away by itself. I believed her and accepted to go into therapy and even start taking antidepressants regularly.

Fast forward to now, I am incredibly better. Probably thanks in part to the antidepressants I feel that my life has literally turned around. I no longer experience extreme anxiety and I am actually less stressed than many people around me. I sleep well, I have friends and a social life and I might even be close to having a sex life for the first time :) I am just enjoying my time and everyone around me has noticed. They say I literally glow and come across as a happy, stable person. I don't feel I am happy and stable but certainly I've come a loooooong way since a while ago, and for the first time I see a future for myself, I am able to make plans and forgive myself if I fail to realize them. My self esteem, while still low, has greatly improved. 

That said, my ED is getting worse. I gained weight thanks to binges and am now at a healthy weight, but my eating habits are incredibly messed up. While back in winter I just restricted, now I restrict, binge, purge, vomit, overexercise, obsess about calories to the point of counting the calorie of a single sugarfree gum...each and every anorexic/disordered eating habit you can think of, I have it.

I don't understand what is going on. I tried to talk with my therapist, but she just repeats the same old ""control"" thing which is starting to grow a bit old because it doesn't really help me. I don't feel a particular need to control my life, and if anything I feel that the ED is controlling me. I hate it but it's automatic, I just have an instinctive reaction towards food that I don't even realize consciously sometimes. It's weird but it is a thing and I don't know how to fight it.

Any advice?",1558994687,5/27/2019 17:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bts107/request_ed_getting_worse_despite_things_going/,1

However, I still hit points of the year where it's hard to overcome my urges. I've been relapsing really bad for the past week and can't seem to get back on my feet. I talk to my SO about it, but I tend to leave out some parts because he feels guilty if he's not home to help (but he has a different work schedule, and he shouldn't have to feel responsible for my actions). Does anyone have any advice on how to get back on your feet? Last time I had a lapse in recovery it lasted 3 months. I do not want this to happen again. 

Also, does anyone else tend to seem like they're not their self when they are relapsing? I feel like I'm more of a dick to my SO, and have no intention of doing it. I feel like the ED has a stronger hold on my mind than my own thoughts. I don't like who I am when my mind is overrun with ED because it's not me. My SO can typically tell when it's more of the ED ""talking"", but he can't rationalize with me when my head is filled with those thoughts.

1195,bxapj3,Request: Seeking advice on what changes to expect,"Hi,

I've recently sought medical help due to my 10 + years of bulimia purging anywhere from 3 to 10 times per day, (although my doctor has diagnosed it as 'Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified', as I don't binge on food).

My doctors and therapist have discussed with me that there will probably be some weight gain due to my body re-hydrating itself. I'm currently at a lower/normal weight and my doctor said I will probably stay in the same range, but I'm still horrified of what might happen.

I've been eating a healthy diet - very small portions multiple times a day. It is probably not enough, but at the moment it helps me from not feeling so sickly full that I physically can not keep food down - or eating ""forbidden food"" causing me to fall out of my recovery. I'm hoping to gradually increase my intake without bombarding myself with big amounts of food that I'm not use too. 

I'm scared to see the scales moves up, so I'm trying to prepare myself, and understand what is happening and why so that I don't get scared and take a step backwards.

1198,bwwuwn,Request: Am I weight concious/healthy or do I have disordered eating?,"Hello,

I am 27 years old. I was slightly overweight when I got pregnant last year and became very fixated on not gaining too much weight during pregnancy. When I delivered I had gained on the lower end of normal weight gain for someone overweight. 

My little one is 5 months old and I have lost a significant amount of weight and am now on the lower end of a normal BMI. I feel amazing, I work out 5 or 6 days a week, and I am still losing weight. Of note, I am not breastfeeding. 

I have had numerous family members/coworkers/friends ask me if I am okay or tell me I have lost too much weight. I am at a healthy BMI so I really don't think I have lost too much weight, but all of the comments are frustrating and do make me question if I may be slipping into disordered eating. I do still want to lose a bit of weight. I haven't been this weight since middle school and I feel great and my athletic ability is better than it has been in a very long time. 

I eat 2 to 3 meals a day. They aren't always the biggest meals because I do still want to lose weight, but it's not like I'm not eating. I don't feel sad/depressed/lethargic or anything like that. Although I do spend quite a bit of time focusing on weight loss/eating healthy/weight loss forums. 

I had a cardiology appointment a month ago and my doctor kept saying how healthy I am and he was glad I am doing so well after having my little one. I have a yearly appointment with a new primary care physician in a few days and I am just getting anxious that they may think I have an issue. I totally get that some of my symptoms line up with disordered eating - drastic weight loss, countless bruises on my legs (from rock climbing), passing out (I have a cardiac condition), low blood pressure, bradycardia... I truly do not feel that I have an issue but I also don't want to be accused of being anorexic and have to explain myself. 

Has anyone been diagnosed or questioned about disordered eating while at a normal weight? If my goal is to lose weight but still be at a normal weight is that really disordered or just a goal?

1203,bw2jhb,Request: Post,"Hey, so I have a doubt and I was wondering if you 
would post this text, please.

Do I have an Eating Disorder?

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY LONG.
I was about nine or ten when Body Dysmorphia met me, but I wasn’t really concerned about my weight until three or four years ago. After all the past years I had been telling myself fat, I started to control my food and I apparently lost weight to the point of people telling me if I was on a diet, but I didn’t think I was fat. The first year I cut down on junk food like chips, and since then I don’t eat them. Then I started to cut down cookies and greasy things. I controlled my food but I actually ate something. Things got “worse” in this year. I started to control everything. People said I was not fat, but I literally cried and got mad because I didn’t see myself as skinny and it made me mad that they were lying to me. Well, I become obsessed with food and people often called me a skeleton, which made me mad because I still saw myself as fat. I don’t know if I have an eating disorder because I told myself to eat and well, I did, although sometimes I felt guilty and i made myself sick, but some days I just starve. I sometimes starve if I want to wear specific clothes. Now I gained weight, and I’m trying to lose it again, but I eat sometimes, and it’s really confusing me, because I really eat, and sometimes greasy things without feeling guilty enough to throw up.
But I have “fear foods”, por example, I haven’t eaten chips in like two years, or hamburgers, which I crave a lot, or mayo. Mayo is really the scariest food, and I can’t eat those foods. Sometimes I starve and I cry because people make eat but I feel like I’m failing. So I’m in this cycle un which some days I don’t eat anything at all, it I just eat once a day, but I sometimes eat a lot. I do feel cold all the time, and Love cooking but not eating the food. I love watching people eat(mukbangs or ASMR). Even though I get really hungry it feels good, it’s like a torture to me, but a sweet one and I just don’t know if I have an eating disorder. It’s just that I’m so fat, I think so, I don’t know. I don’t exercise excessively, for example, and I don’t feel sick enough. My parents took me to a psychiatrist, but she just focused on my depression instead of my food behaviours. I’m really sad, because no one has taken my “problem” seriously. I also don’t know if I restrict. Like if I eat, I would eat like a half of a small bowl, but I’m so used to those portions that I think they are normal and the ones I should be eating. If not more.  But whenever someone serves my food, I just think it’s a lot, and I’m the only one thinking that. But I don’t know If it’s my mind or it is actually a lot, or if that is the actual normal serving. And I don’t know how to find out that. For example, when I want to add something to a food, I add what i think is normal and everyone’s serving I so much bigger.
I remember once I told to myself that I had to “get better” and I went to Mc Donald’s and ordered chicken nuggets and they asked me how many, let’s say the min. They give you is six nuggets and the max. Is twelve? Well I started to think,”No, ten or twelve are too much, just get six” and so I did, but when I started eating I then I realized I said I was going to get better, and I truly didn’t want six. I wanted more, but I immediately ordered six. And whenever people ask me if i want a chip or anything. Even fruit, I say “no”. It’s really weird. I honestly don’t think I have an eating disorder. Like I’m way to fat to have one, I’m not even underweight. But well, I want to see your opinions. 
Sorry if it was too boring, but please help.

1205,bw2h4q,"Request: My friends and I all have various kinds of eating disorders and I really need help, I’m at such a loss with what to do?!?"," 

I’m not totally sure if this is okay to post or what I’m doing (I’m usually just a reddit browser) but I really, really need advice and I have absolutely no one to go to so if anyone has any suggestions with how to help it would mean the absolute world and could (maybe) help save a life!?

Over the past three-ish years (I’m 17 now) I’ve developed pretty bad anxiety and depression which has come hand in hand with some body dysmorphia stuff and, more recently, an extremely unhealthy relationship with food. I make myself purposefully skip meals and not eat due to the absolute pure hate I have for my body. I want to torture myself and deny it of sustenance just to feel the pain and I feel so proud when I go days without eating. Not sure what to diagnose it and I haven’t thought that far into it, other than realising how wrong it is, and I’m not sure if I want to. I’ve just kinda thought that it’s a phase that I will (hopefully) grow out of soon.

The main issue isn’t me though. Yesterday, the closest friend I’ve ever had (literally a part of me, there’s no one I love more) revealed that she’s struggling with anorexia. Obviously the news broke me and I’m kicking myself over how I hadn’t noticed, but she also mentioned that she decided to tell me now because she knows about my issues too, noticing little things like my minor loss of weight and me denying food on occasion. I’ve talked to her before about my depression and she’s witnessed me at my lowest points but we’ve never discussed food before and this is new territory for both of us as I haven’t wanted to burden her with ANOTHER one of my issues in the past. We have no idea how to stop doing this to ourselves and we both don’t want to (though we know we have to). Her issues stem more from drug abuse (marijuana) I’ve told her she needs to stop with the regular smoking and she knows that it’s so incredibly unhealthy (and recognises it as the main cause) but it’s so much easier said than done and I believe it’s a a source of comfort for her due to other issues in her life at the moment.

The last thing to add to the mix is our other friend, who has an incredibly serious case of bulimia and has been struggling for a really long time. Her doctor says if she doesn’t stop the purging soon her body will quite literally shut down but even that isn’t enough to motivate her and we have NO idea how to help. Her parents don’t seem to care enough and ultimately it all comes down to her, but she seems to be too far gone.

I’m so sorry for the long read and I’m honestly not sure if this is even the right place to go but I guess I just really need some help, advice, anything? I want to help my friends but I don’t know how?? Going to their parents (and mine) is definitely not an option, for other reasons, and I just feel so useless. I guess we’re all just a bunch of messed up teenagers and in the long run it might actually just be a ‘phase’ but it sure doesn’t feel like it right now.",1559510610,6/2/2019 16:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bw2h4q/request_my_friends_and_i_all_have_various_kinds/,11
1206,bw2gj0,Request: Request for advice: disordered eating or eating disorder?,"I have in the past spoken with my therapist about disordered eating habits. But I just assumed it was past of generalized anxiety and panic disorder, a bit of OCD. It started when I was in a relationship w a professional athlete who pushed and encouraged me to push myself and my body very hard in rock climbing. I loved it, I won competitions, I worked and trained extremely hard. 5-8 hrs every day. I ate mostly raw vegan and was healthy. Things romantically fell through with my partner and my panic disorder increased dramatically thus placing me in the psych hosp for 1 mo. After I got out I was still training but stopped eating.  I was obsessed w climbing and felt really guilty about eating all foods especially animal products to the point that I would cry at the sight of eggs (wtf) I had never been vegan, I just had this sudden obsession with my health and thought everything was going to give me cancer. I stopped using a microwave and threw away everything plastic I had and replaced it w glass. I found it upsetting to eat most foods. Like literally all foods. And then eating became sad and too difficult. I have since then fluctuated between eating slightly more, to restricted to one small snack a day usually unhealthy. I have a lot of anxiety and depression I am addressing otherwise. I know they are associated. I feel as though I am feeding someone I don’t like, when I feed my (what I see as) defective useless body. I still regularly have panic attacks that affect work and driving and my marriage. My body hurts a lot when I eat most food. Due to (I guess) anxiety related digestive issues. So food is not appealing. The sensation and smell of food to my mouth and nose is sometimes sickening. Not sure why. I just start to notice it and find it disgusting. I hate to see or hear other people eat bc it feels violating. This caused a lot of fights with my parents growing up about me leaving the dinner table crying and escalating to full panic attack at the sound of them chewing food, which obv made them really mad. I feel guilty for having these feelings about eating because obviously it’s not normal or healthy but I can’t just force myself to stop. When I buy food I feel like I wasted money, which I don’t have much of. Most of the time I have no interest in eating at all but force myself to most of the time. Anyway I know obviously it goes hand in hand w anxiety.

1211,bvffso,"Request: Post request: I think I have an eating disorder, but I feel like I'm faking it.","Subject: I think I have an eating disorder, but I feel like I'm faking it.

WHY I'M POSTING... I'm posting my current experience because I want to understand if it's normal to feel this way. Or if my feelings that I'm pretending to have an eating disorder mean that I am just pretending!

ME: I'm a guy in my late 20s, and I'm currently off work with 'stress'. I work as a Dr in the NHS in the North of England. I do have various psychiatry appointments on the way and have had lots of contact with my GP - I don't have a diagnosis at present.

WHAT'S HAPPENED: Recently I've lost a lot of weight, and have found my job incredibly stressful. This has resulted in me taking my first ever period of sick leave from work after 8 years of work.
But I've come to realise I've also become (what feels like) extremely controlling about my food and what I eat - this has been increasingly so over, realistically, the last 2.5 years give or take. And a lot of my stress probably stems from this boiling over into my job.

HOW I FEEL, SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: In terms of both how I feel and objective abnormalities my blood counts are low, I'm constantly apathetic - not sad or happy, I struggle to enjoy anything, I get super cold, I've not weighed this little since I was about 14 years old, I haven't had any libido for months, I get stomach cramps, I've been getting leg cramps and back aches, I get very anxious and guilty around food and social occasions with food/alcohol/calories, and you can see the veins all over my body (Grim).

BUT... I FEEL GUILTY ABOUT MY ACTIONS The thing is, this all feels like a choice to me. And I don't know why I'm choosing to do it? I don't feel ill, sure I feel tired and hungry, but out of decisions I make. And objectively I can see they're bad for me, I just struggle to do something sensible like eat a bit more!

WEIRD THINGS I DO - It takes me at least 30 minutes to buy lunch from the shop, I walk round and round and inevitably come out with a salad or a small soup - I don't let people cook for me at home, I don't let people serve me food - I do a lot of cooking, I enjoy it, but I'll normally give away most of the food I make. The best example of this is baking where I'll probably have half a slice of brownie and palm off the rest on other people. - I avoid restaurants, if it's unavoidable I google menus for ages and try to work out the calories or pick out places you can eat which have small meals. I never pick something I actually want to eat. - I run or drink squash to suppress my appetite, as well as running for calorie burn - If I eat a snack, I'll often end up spitting it out - I avoid nuts, dairy, meat, apples/pears, alcohol, coffee with milk in... in fact I haven't had a beer for months because it feels like wasted calories. - If someone brings food to work, I tend to hoard it. Same at a buffet. I'll grab loads, then put it in lunchboxes so I can eat it later - often I'll give the food away rather than eat it myself.

MY QUESTION Do these behaviours and choices I make stack up with an ED diagnosis? Or am I just trying to get attention or something like that?

I'm late 20s and quite overweight. In my early 20s I developed this bad habit of getting fast food, getting home and getting high (weed), then eating a bit more than I should. This progressed into me getting 1-2 extra items, for later. Then I started passing out around 11 or 12, then would wake up at 2-3 still high and with really bad munchies, so I would eat whatever I had left, then go back to sleep. Over time, my body became accustomed to this ""meal time"", and now for the last few years I wake up very hungry every single night, and end up eating something. Sometimes just an hour after falling asleep. I knew it was not normal or healthy. Recently I've noticed I tend to eat junk food in bunches, especially when nobody else is around. Then I feel very guilty.

I'm trying to get on a '3 meals and 2 snacks' eating routine, aiming for my food intake to be roughly between 10am and 7pm.

But I cannot for the life of me figure out how to break this middle of the night hunger routine. I've tried taking sleeping pills for a couple days to see if I can throw the cycle off, but nothing. I feel like I need to lock my cupboards every night.

Hello everyone. First off I am a 27 year old female in the military. I've struggled with binge eating/bulimia since I was 17 years old. I just recently sought help. I have been seeing a nutritionist who has been wonderful with helping me learn my hunger ques and understanding that its okay to eat food. I can even eat food that I like!

Lately progress feels so unobtainable. I failed a military physical fitness test because my waist measurement was too large. This standard alone causes me so much anxiety and stress. I don't feel adequate or good enough if I don't meet their standards. I've had some family emergencies happen along with being a shift worker and having to switch every two weeks between a day shift and a night shift due to low manning.

Today I asked my boyfriend to pick up some pants and polo for a ride along I'm doing with a local flight medic company tomorrow. I knew my size. When I saw them I just felt my heart drop... I don't feel as big as those look. It hurts me so much. I feel utterly disgusting. Which makes me just want to clam up and hide away. Put on big baggy clothing and go to sleep so I don't have to deal with the disappointment.

I never in my life thought I would be the size I am today. Needless to day I am on the heavier side of overweight. I don't feel pretty. I don't feel worthy. I dont know how to fix myself. I dont know anything.

I'm guessing I just needed to write of all this down and hear some encouraging words or advice.

I also notice anytime someone says I look healthy I get upset because I know it is because I am gaining weight back. I was so proud of my progress with self love and getting used to my body during recovery. How do I convince myself other people will still love me if I gain weight. I get nervous that my boyfriend will not love me if I gain weight but I really want to try hard with recovering, as I was very sick before.

1226,by3jhp,Request: Advice about updating bf on eating disorder," 

For over ten years, I've struggled on and off with eating disorders, primarily bulimia but with occasional periods of anorexia. I've been with my SO for several years, and he is aware of my history and has always been extremely supportive and helpful. For over a year, I had been ""clean,"" with no purging for 13 months, and had gained some weight to a healthy weight. My partner was aware of my progress and very proud of me. Unfortunately, I've had a backslide and struggled with binging and purging again. This has been going on for a few months now. Initially I didn't tell my SO because I was hoping it would be a ""one-time thing,"" like we all do. Now that it's been a few months, I've had to acknowledge that this is a genuine backslide, and I'm working on reaching out to family and a therapist for help getting back on track. I'm still currently a healthy weight but my purging has gotten out of control, and I know I need help. The problem is, I don't want to tell my SO. He's been nothing but supportive, and I don't think he'd be angry or anything like that, but he's been so happy with the progress I made and I know it would make him sad and worried that I'm struggling again. I have a support network outside of him (family and a few close friends), so I could work through this without him, and part of me wants to deal with it on my own and not worry him. However, we have a strong relationship built on trust, and I'm wondering if this would be lying by omission. For those who have struggled with an ED while in a healthy relationship, do you think it's okay to deal with this backslide alone, or do I need to tell him out of respect for our relationship?",1559964628,6/7/2019 22:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/by3jhp/request_advice_about_updating_bf_on_eating/,3
1227,by3j60,Request: Help understanding relapses after the underlying issue has been dealt with,"I developed an eating disorder at age 13 from anxiety and depression that stemmed from early childhood sexual abuse. I was hospitalized at 19 and have been in recovery for 9 years. The past year and a half I have been in therapy for the sexual abuse. I have made a lot of progress and my anxiety and depression have both gone down drastically without medication. I’m not against medication- I’m just saying it’s clear things are getting better. So WHY am I still randomly relapsing???? I am so confused. I’ve always heard eating disorders are very serious symptoms of an underlying issue. Well I fixed that so why am I constantly wanting to relapse. I am so frustrated. Is it because it’s an addiction and even though the issues are being dealt, addiction is addiction? My “relapses” are more like week long slips that happen every 6-8 weeks. I go all out and get super obsessed with wanting to relapse and then I fight it and I’m fine. Then it repeats.

1228,by1qf2,Request: Post request: in need of words of advice and encouragement from people who understand,"Sorry in advance for how long this is. 

I had a somewhat sudden “awakening” type moment last week when I finally realized and admitted that I actually do have an eating disorder and that I wanted help to recover from it. I reached out to friends, my boyfriend, and my mom to tell them what’s going on and get support. I am very close with my mom and she was away on vacation the last two weeks, which was when my disorder got to the breaking point, so that was really hard. I also want to add that my mom is a dietician specializing in eating disorders (her specialty is adolescents and I’m 25, so I’m a little outside her area but she still obviously knows a lot). I knew she would be able to help me in a way no one else in my support system would be able to, so I have been desperate for her to return from her trip. We live in different states for the time being, but at least when she’s home I can FaceTime her. 

I think in large part because of my mom’s job and specialty I always thought I would be immune to eating disorders. I thought she had raised me to be confident enough in my body and to have a healthy attitude towards food, because she told me and others how she was deliberately trying to do that because she wanted to protect me. But I’ve been living far from home for 2 years now, and a few months ago my eating disorder hit hard. I had gained some weight since college, and I saw the scale hit a new number last February and it triggered me to be dead set on losing weight as quickly as possible, with my goal being what I weighed in high school. I started doing intermittent fasting, and increased from 12 hour fasts to 16 hours to 18 hours to only eating once per day if at all. I looked in the mirror and was happy with my progress at first but it was never enough. I still haven’t reached my initial “goal weight” but I do weigh about what I did in junior/senior year of high school. I also know that dropping those last few pounds to achieve it wouldn’t be enough. I can see and feel the bottom of my rib cage, but a voice in my head is telling me I need to be able to see each individual rib to be thin enough.

I know that’s not true and I know I should stop losing, and I am working on getting help. I mentioned earlier that my mom and I live in different states for the time being, and that is ending soon. I’m moving back to my home state for medical school in less than 3 weeks. The great thing about that is that I’ll have more support so so soon, and my mom has the knowledge and connections to get me the care I need. The bad thing about that is that there’s not much point in trying to see a professional where I currently live since I’m leaving so soon. Which means I’m stuck in this limbo of knowing I need help but not getting it for a few more weeks, and I could use advice on strategies for how to cope in the meantime. My life here has been so stressful recently, and my eating disorder became my way of coping. But now I don’t know how to cope with the eating disorder. The temptation is to start restricting again, but I know logically that won’t help even though the voice in my head is saying it’s the only thing that’ll make me feel better. 

Also I’ve started having some negative health effects, including easy bruising, fainting/loss of consciousness, and near constant lightheadedness. Losing consciousness and ending up on the floor in pain with no idea how I got there was terrifying and made me feel so confused, scared, and helpless. 

Now that I know I have a problem and have been trying to get help, a lot of my friends and family have said that since I know I should eat more I can just do it, and that it’s not a real mental illness but a lifestyle choice. Yesterday I got really upset with my boyfriend for telling me I have a choice in how eating makes me feel even though he knows it “seems” like I don’t. The only one who seems to remotely understand is my mom, but she hasn’t gone through it herself so she only knows secondhand. It leaves me in a lonely place.",1559952412,6/7/2019 19:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/by1qf2/request_post_request_in_need_of_words_of_advice/,1
1229,by1pfj,Request: In need of advice about bringing up what makes me uncomfortable to my mother.,"To give a little back story my ED stemmed way back when I was 15 (I'm 20 now) and I was very overweight but also struggling with a lot of mental health issues too but I found comfort in food and always have. This was for sure what was causing my weight gain along side barely leaving the house.

Following a break up with my first boyfriend at 16 me and my mother decided to go on a health mission. We began running regularly and joined a local weight loss group. We both lost weight FAST. And they rewarded us each an everytime; stickers and ribbons littered my weight loss diary. I lost nearly 5 stone in 2.5 months, combined we lost nearly 8 stone between us. 

It was extraordinary and we both looked and felt amazing but we were getting sick of having to meet up for 2 hours every week to weigh-in and didnt want to keep a log book of everything we ate. It was so maticulous and precise. As we got rewarded the more we lost and I would often beat my self up if I put on 1/2 pound. So we left the group and felt well equipped we could keep up the fitness and health by ourselves. 

I even got approached by their magazine and was asked to do an interview as I recieved a 'Women of The Year award for how well I had done. 

With all this in mind, back to the present day. I feel very unformfortable weighing my self, talking about weight and dieting isnt ideal either. She knows this as I am very open with her about what makes me comfortable. 

When we left the group I was significantly lighter. But here's the thing, I haven't purged regularly for over a month (except 1 relapse) and my mother knows this but she's also noticed Ive gained weight. She sees this as me being unhealthy despite knowing this.

I feel healthy, I have my periods back to normal again and feel I have a positive outlook on life in general and I am trying everyday to love my self a little more. It's even harder when you KNOW you've gained and trying to untangle that weight doesn't equal to worth is very hard in itself let alone trying to like you self. Its very tiring and she doesn't seem to realise.

She keeps sending me pictures of when I was super skinny saying ""Oo look what I found, you're gorgeous in this"". I obv took this as, ""well you look good there but not now"". And keeps on sending me links to videos of ""fit and fearless"" people. She has also asked if I wanna rejoin the group again and again. 

I really do understand that she's trying to help but I can't help thinking this is really insensitive? I am trying to be happy how I am and accepting my self. I DO do exercise when my back allows me too I go on walks. But that's me. That's all I can do right now. I just think she's trying to morph me into someone I'm not. 

How do I bring this up without her taking offence? This is a very sensitive topic for both of us as I'm sure you can understand.",1559952216,6/7/2019 19:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/by1pfj/request_in_need_of_advice_about_bringing_up_what/,1

1231,by1o7v,Request: I'm scared my sister-in-law is developing an eating disorder and I don't know how to help her," 

Basically what the title says. My younger SIL (17F) has been showing signs/risks that I, and research in general, link to developing an eating disorder. She has low self esteem at times, thinks she is ""fat"" even though she is a healthy weight for her height and is active in sports at school, has tried diets with her mother (which is a WHOLE separate can of worms we don't need to open right now), intermittent fasting with her father, spends a lot of time on Instagram looking at models and ""health/fitness"" accounts (that brag about vitamins and dietary supplements/diarrhea tea 🙄), and numerous other criteria.

Most recently what I've been concerned about is that she told me she started calorie counting in an effort to ""eat better"", which *yes* can work for some people, but for the people I know, it has led to restricting. I said something along the lines of, ""Oh, calories are just an energy measurement, you really want to look more at the nutritional aspects like protein, carbs, sodium, vitamins, and such. Don't bother with calories if you can help it, it'll just stress you out"" and she just kind of shrugged it off and went on eating her pizza slice.

Today she informed that she's going vegetarian after seeing a video in her health class about how big companies treat and prepare animals they intend to sell for meat. Again, this would be understandable under normal circumstances, but to me it more like another way she could start to eat less and therefore lose weight/""be healthy"".

I'm just really scared for her, and I don't want her to go down the same path that I did when I was in high school. I don't know how to go about helping her before it's too late. I guess I could start by telling her about my personal experiences with anorexia and bulimia, but I really don't know...

TLDR; afraid my SIL will develop an ED, she shows lots of signs that can lead to one; is currently calorie counting and vegetarian; I don't know what to do or how to help her before shit hits the fan",1559952001,6/7/2019 19:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/by1o7v/request_im_scared_my_sisterinlaw_is_developing_an/,2

1233,by1nhp,Request: Tips for healthy life moving past an ED?,"Hi all, I’ve struggled with eating disorders since I can remember. In elementary school, I obsessively overate, and was one of the largest kids in the class. In middle school, I abruptly stopped eating and shed nearly half my weight in a few months. I remained anorexic well into college, until my then-boyfriend began to cook with me which quelled my fear of food. Up until recently, I maintained a “slim” figure on my 5’ 11” frame, with restriction and exercise the backbone of my existence. I entered another long-term relationship where my diet was overturned (I was a vegetarian of 8 years with disordered habits) and entered a social sphere with my partner where drinking beer, and lots of it, was encouraged. We ate and drank and ate and drank and I slowly gained back the weight that would send me to a BMI bordering between “healthy” and “overweight “. I felt confident in my changing body, holding on to the praise I received from my partner about how much “better” I looked, and thought I had finally beat my eating disorder. The relationship ended explosively rounding the 5 year mark, and my self-confidence in what I ate and how I viewed my body, went right out the window. In the 12 months after the relationship ended, I ate emotionally, continued to drink, stopped commuter biking as I once religiously did, and broke my ankle in a fall traversing uneven sidewalk - the cherry on top. I had surgery, 1 plate and 9 screws, and was bedridden for three weeks.

I literally did not, nor could not, walk for 3 months, slowly became active in physical therapy for another 2 months, began walking casually around 5 months post-surgery, and just got on my bike for the first time in 8 months
yesterday. In that time, I’ve gained weight in places I’ve never had weight before, it pains me to feel my body move in an unfamiliar way to make room for the new parts of me that now exist. I avoid looking at mirrors, no pictures allowed, and am terrified to try on my summer staples because I know they won’t fit. My closet taunts me, the old photographs of “thin” me send me into self-deprecating spirals, and the confidence I once thought I had not so long ago, had been replaced by an underlying disdain for myself. I’ve quit attending social events because I’m so disgusted with my appearance, I spend most my time sleeping. I value myself less because of my weight gain.


I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom, but I know that I will go even lower if I don’t make changes now. So, I’ve begun to get back on the bike and strive to adopt perspectives that won’t feed into my disordered black and white thinking. Hard part is, it’s either all or nothing, all the time. A large of my excuse for not addressing my health is because I’m afraid I will slip back into another anorexia and over-exercising phase.

Wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to navigate how to maintain a healthy body despite being someone that will always struggle with an eating disorder?

Also looking for good reads on the subject as well.

Eating scares me and gaining any weight simply terrifies me. Recently I opened up to my gf about this, this was the first person I have ever told how I feel and as she suggested I try posting in this sub for some advice.

I don't know if I have an eating disorder. I know I have a problem with food but I feel like calling it a disorder would be unfair to all those people who actually struggle with it.

Anyways enough of the backstory. Basically, over the past few months I've been really struggling with my eating. For a few months I would replace meals with coffee, I'd have one one meal a day, drink water instead of eating to feel full. I go to sleep every night with an empty stomach. Throughout the day if my stomach is full I just feel disgusting. I freak out over any meal I have and feel guilty for eating at all. I haven't had more than two meals in a day in months. For the past week I've been back to calorie counting. I know my habits are unhealthy but sometimes I still deny that I have a problem to myself. I asked my gf to tell my two best friends tomorrow so I could get their opinion on it because maybe if there's more people telling me that I'm being unhealthy it'll be easier to accept.

I'm of an average weight but I'm scared of where this is going to take me. I have an addictive and obsessive personality and I don't want to end up worse than I am already.

I need advice on where to go from here, do you think this is enough of an issue to reach out for help?

1235,bxvuys,Request: Advice request,"My twin sister [19F] and I are going through similar struggles but in a very different way. 

My sister is a struggling anorexic and severely underweight while i struggle with overeating and am severely overweight. 

There are many factors that lead us to where we are but to make a long story short, we both were molested and forced to do sexual activities together by our father for our whole childhood while our mother continued to play dumb and not help us. After my father and mother were arrested, my sister and I spent the next couple of years bouncing around in foster care we were legal age. Now we live in an apartment together. 

Needless to say, we've been through ALOT together and Im very proud of how much we've overcome and how close we are BUT we still are struggling. 

We both have had our respective eating disorders for years and since we've moved in together we've tried to hold eachother accountable but we fail at it so badly. 

I generally make us dinner and while i try to limit my eating and encourage her to eat, we generally tend to fall back on old habits. Il eat my meal very fast while i watch her pick at it and not even eat a nibble. Eventually, she'll just convince me to eat her plate as she once again skips a meal. Generally, the only time she does eat is when she brings home takeout from somewhere. However, she only like to take a bite or two just to taste in and then convinces me to eat the rest. Its a vicious cycle where i keep getting bigger and she keeps getting smaller. 

I feel like shit every time but I just see her uneaten food and i just want to eat it. and she knows i'll happily eat it, so she encourages me to. I dont think either of us are bad people but i do think we both realize our vices and we tend to use them to sabotage each other (and thats horrible). 

I dont know how to maneuver this or handle this and im just so scared. Despite us being twins, i've always been kind of the ""big sister"" of us and i just feel so much pressure to not only help myself but my sister as well. 

And (and im sure you have already picked up on this), we have a very co-dependent and borderline unhealthy relationship. We not only share a studio apartment but we also still sleep in the same bed. Trust me, I know we're a bit too old for that but since we were kids, we both found comfort sleeping in the same bed and we really haven't grown out of it. During all those years we were abused, we atleast took comfort in knowing we had each other. It was the only comfort we had. 

(Sleeping near eachother also helps when either one of us has PTSD induced panic attack late at night. That way we can comfort one another just in case)  

I know we need help but We dont really have family anymore, and lord knows we cant afford treatment or therapy, so idk what to do. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",1559920921,6/7/2019 10:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bxvuys/request_advice_request/,1

Hey. My post on here may be a bit different considering I see most people talking about how they're going through a rough time with anorexia or such. For me, I have the opposite problem. Ever since I was a child, I have always been overweight and obsessed with food. My days revolve around eating. As I grew up I realized I was different from the other kids because they could ride bikes and they could go running around and play sports. I couldn't do that with them. When I went on a field trip to a amusement park, they told me I couldn't get on a ride with my friend because I was too fat and he was too skinny compared to me to be on the ride safely. By the time I hit 6th grade, I was in extra large clothes. My parents tried their best to help but even they couldn't stop my eating habits. I ate according to times, not according to when I was hungry. I ate and ate and ate until I would almost throw up. I didn't go to many field trips because of my size. I didn't try exercise or dieting because I figured I was already hopeless. I have suffered many indignities because of my weight. As you can imagine I was bullied a lot as a child, and therefore developed a sense of humor as a bubble to try and shield myself from the hurtful comments made towards me. My friends parents would refer to me always as, ""the fat kid."" They wouldn't want to invite me over due to a fear that I would break their furniture. I tried many times in my high school years to diet, to lose all of this weight. But Everytime the food would draw me back. Finally, in my past senior year, I didn't go to my gradnite or prom because I didn't wanna embarrass myself on a ride or on a dance floor. My weight has always held me back. Now I am 17, pushing on the verge of 450 pounds, and am once again trying my best to diet and exercise to lose this weight. I am fresh out of high school with no plans for college yet as I wanted to lose weight before I would go. But I am so afraid. Afraid that I will fall off my diet like I always do. Afraid that I will never shed off my weight. Afraid of just dying of a heart attack in my sleep or injuring myself because of my weight. I need help. Any help at all that any of you can give. Any help that might be able to make me change myself. And advice for me to take. Just anything at all. I don't wanna be in this alone. Please. If anyone can take the time to just read this and offer me something at all to help with my weight loss, I'll take it happily. I just want to be normal for once in my life. I never got that chance as a kid. I want that chance as an adult for the rest of my life. Thank you.

I’m getting really frightened and I don’t know what to do.

I’m a female just out of her teenage years and I recently started a medication that has a random side effect of decreasing appetite- I hadn’t relapsed in a couple years so I thought that I’d be able to control myself. Well, it totally killed my appetite at first and a lot of weight dropped off of me. Then, after a while, the effects started to become less intense and it shifted from me not being hungry to being hungry and restricting myself from eating completely. The urge to make myself eat in a healthy way is gone even though my SO is concerned about my weight loss. Somehow I can’t find the will to improve even if it’s for him.

I’m pretty overweight, so while I know that this total lack of eating is unhealthy, my brain is soothing me by saying that since I’m overweight it won’t be harmful to restrict until I actually become underweight. I justify my actions by saying that my eating habits aren’t unhealthy, my weight is; I keep saying I’ll just stop doing it when I’m at a “normal” weight. I think about seeking treatment and feel physically ill like I’m having a heart attack- I just can’t bear to see my weight rise again and so I’ve been taking extreme measures to hide it from my family.

That I can use my ED as an excuse for negative actions: like if someone is shooting points that I don’t respect my mom because I didn’t eat meal which she prepared for me, or I react or talk aggressively with my parents at the moment (but my mood is completely f#cked right now because I ate too much and feel guilt and pain all over my body, so I am in aggresive mood), or when I see a woman lifting weights and controling her diet and she is successful at it and it makes me feel terrible because I don’t have as much mental control of my actions as her (so I find an excuse: I am sick, I have an ED, I can’t compare myself to her). Or when I literally put myself higher than others just because I have lived with ED for almost ten years (I am 20 years old right now) and haven’t killed myself yet, and these thought lead me to thoughts of how I deserve more in this life and I deserve that people treat me better, more respectful, or that they should be really careful with me, especially talking about my lifestyle and choices.

Sometimes I get this pride from nowhere and sometimes I lose it with some other emotions and feeling and feel hatred towards myself. Is it pibolar or is it human psychology as it is?

Guys, I don’t know if it’s normal for people like us, or not. I think it is not, so if you agree with me and have the same problem or resolved that problem in your life, please give some tips on how to change my mindset and appreciate whatever I have in my life right now without asking for more and more...",1560990240,6/19/2019 19:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/c2ozj0/requests_are_my_emotions_normal_for_someone_with/,7

1241,c2adma,Request: I probably have an eating disorder but I'm not sure,"I have been underweight since I'm a kid. I'm almost 21 y/o. (Female btw)
I know for a fact that I have bad eating habits. I always try to get them under control. Sometimes I make it for a little while but most of the time I don't.
I don't want to be that skinny girl. I sincerely want to gain weight. And im sad about that I've dropped quite a lot again. I feel very ashamed about it tbh. I really want to gain weight but I just can't get myself to do it. I don't have appetite. I try to eat.
I skip meals quite often without really realizing it. I forget it.
When I was in a really bad spot two years ago I would purposely not eat and not even drink because I WANTED to pass out at work and get someone to tell me I need help.
I mentioned it to the therapist when I went here because of my depression, that I wasn't eating because I wanted to pass out to get out of work.
It got better when I met my SO.
I gained weight and it felt good, I was happy about it. But that slowed down and I fell back into my eating habits and lost weight again.

I work a physically demanding job but somehow my body can deal with hardly eating and still working good. Lately my muscles get sore very easily though. I've been sick the last two weeks but am better now. Although I  have still have trouble with one of the symptoms. Nothing much, just digesting problems, idk how much would be too much so I leave it at that. 

When I was 16 I had a rough time too, had barely eaten and passed out on my way to school. I was hospitalized for 3 days. Had to track my food intake etc. and was at the doctor and he was persistent about asking me if I'd throw up. I've never made myself throw up. I can't even do it. I have to admit that, during my depression phase I did try to make myself throw up at work, but not because I wanted to lose weight. But because I wanted a reason to leave work.

I'm thinking about going to my therapist tomorrow, meaning not going to work even though I just came back this week from a two week sick leave.
Don't worry about my job though I'm out of here in 5 weeks anyway so that's not an issue. 
Anyway I gotta go back to work but I hope someone can help me a bit or share something. Idk.",1560905492,6/18/2019 19:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/c2adma/request_i_probably_have_an_eating_disorder_but_im/,3

Hi, lost my job in march. My husband is doing okay for us and wants me to get a good job but they are hard to come by around here and he is working ~60 hours a week. Since march, I think I've lost about 15-20 lbs.

I'm beginning to feel unattractive being so skinny but find it hard to eat, and its beginning to worry me. I don't know if its depression, or a new thing I've hear of called ARFID, or something else.

1243,c2adh6,Request: How to not restrict after weighing myself,"Hello! For the past couple years I have struggled with disordered eating and body image issues. A couple years ago, my mother (a dietician) realized that I was  underweight so she put me on a plan to gain a certain amount weight over the summer. At that point, I realized what I was doing was bad and was completely okay with gaining weight back until I gained more weight than planned. I then started to weigh myself everyday and obsess again over my weight. I rowed lightweight in high school and when it came time for spring racing, I was above the maximum weight by a couple pounds. I was able to lose the weight healthily to be able to race, but losing that weight put me back in the mindset of “I need to lose weight”. When I went to college this only got worse as the freshman 15 was my worst nightmare. I actually started skipping meals at the end of last semester because I had a goal weight in mind that I wanted to be at before I came home. 

Luckily, I didn’t have a scale that I used regularly at school, so I couldn’t “keep track” of my weight, healthily or unhealthily. I weighed myself when I got home and realized I had lost a few pounds. I continued to skip breakfast and sometimes lunch because I wanted to keep losing weight. Now I have started to train again and am trying to eat 3 meals a day. However, today I weighed myself out of curiosity and am up a couple pounds since the last time I weighed myself. I immediately regretted doing that and am now trying to persuade myself into eating breakfast instead of skipping it to lose the weight. I have since moved the scale into my parents’ bathroom so I won’t be tempted to use it but am still struggling with the urge to restrict. I know this was a lot and kind of wordy, but any help would be greatly appreciated!",1560905472,6/18/2019 19:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/c2adh6/request_how_to_not_restrict_after_weighing_myself/,2
1244,c2ad1a,Request: Recovery and target weights,"Hi Brave redditors- wishing everyone strength.

Has anyone been to inpatient treatment, specifically for a lengthy amount of time, to recover from severe restrictive anorexia?
I am in recovery, after nearly 14 years of being ill. I initially was just slightly underweight, but I took it WAY too far, and it was definitely a deadly situation.  Now, I love life again - especially being able to be trusted to stay healthy...my family isn't petrified for me, and I feel so glad to be no longer worrying them.  

When I went inpatient, I was restored at just what *they (the team)* considered the cusp of a healthy weight. When I came home, my RD agreed that I was fine at the established weight. I felt fortunate, as if the fear I'd had for so long was not true (""they'll make me ""fat"").
I am grateful for life, and so grateful to be better, although I still do feel a lot of anxiety when I see myself walking around (reflection in a window unexpectedly, etc).

My question is: what if you settle at a slightly lower weight than that range they picked for you? I know all about BMI and healthy weight ranges. I remember what I was like when I didn't have an ED, but was still fit and ate with joy. I was what most people called, thin. My family is thin, none of us are big people, but we aren't extremely petite either.  My family is also all very into their fitness routines, and I often think we all are a bit disordered (except my amazing Mom).

About 5 months after being back in my city/home, I was released from treatment by the local RD when I maintained the same # that I was at when I left inpatient. Now that about five more months have passed, and I have been more active, I feel like my clothes are a little looser. I do not weigh myself, but it wouldn't matter since I never knew the number anyhow. However, I feel I have lost a bit of weight. 
1. I still get my monthly cycle 
2. I'm working hard to eat better, but that is not perfect - I choose safe foods. I also allow a lot of time to pass before I eat, but I've done that since when I first returned. My RD told me to try and eat often, but I was able to maintain that post-treatment weight to her satisfaction. *Pre-treatment, I used to eat like....every 3 days. Very sad.*

3. I love life, my mood is good, etc.

The question: Does a bit of loss - especially if I feel best and great about my body - mean that I'm defying recovery?  It breaks my heart to do anything differently than what I was ""taught"" in treatment, but nothing was easier than doing the right thing then...I was surrounded by peers and a 200% supportive bubble of anti-ED rules and care.

My counselor (therapist) says ""one size doesn't fit all"".
She also said that it is common for ED centers to sometimes do EVERYTHING they can to get the weight on, knowing that there may be a bit of loss when patients return home. (You are only in treatment for a relative blip of time - so they take it as their mission to make you as protected as possible, IMO.)

For the record, I am older (45), and I admit that I value being thin, but not sickly or underweight. In fact, the moment I think back to how terrible I looked (missing so much hair, skin grey, body scarily thin)...I am so glad to be where I am.  I also am still in therapy and she always compliments my recovery process, is proud of me, etc.

Mods, thank you for helping us post our requests, and as always, please feel free to edit if anything here is against the rules.  Thank you for doing this work for us.",1560905400,6/18/2019 19:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/c2ad1a/request_recovery_and_target_weights/,3
1245,c205va,Request: I would like advice,"Throughout these past months I’ve gone through stressful times. My husband and I have just moved. I will skip breakfast, skip lunch, then sometimes I’ll skip dinner or scruff down my plate and same thing the next day except for dinner I might only take 2 or 3 bites. 

Today my nephew was over, he’s 4. We sat down and I heated up a hot pocket and he toasted some waffles. He wanted to trade so I ended up eating 2 small eggo waffles with syrup and strawberries how he likes them and then we sat together and I ate about a cup of cereal with a cup and a half of milk. After that my husband came home from work and I had a cup of noodles and he ate his dinner I cooked for him. 

We don’t have a problem with money for food, we shop weekly for food and I cook the thing is I have no instrest in eating. I try to but I just can’t and it makes me so sad. I’m so skinny and I want to gain weight so I can go to the gym again and get fit and toned like I was before. I miss feeling great about my body. I dislike how I look now.  

I went dress shopping recently and I couldn’t fit into a certain size It broke my heart and I just sat in the fitting room quietly crying. 

I want to eat healthy again like I used to, breakfast lunch, snack and dinner but it seems so hard. I get full so fast but I don’t even eat anything. 

My bones hurt more, my head constantly hurts. I had the sharpest pain in the shoulders Saturday that I felt literally paralyzed for a few seconds randomly. I’m more easily irritated. I just know my body feels like shit but I just don’t seem to be interested in food.

1247,c1w8q0,Request: How to cope with weight gain?,"The past few years I've been anorexic and bulimic. I barely ate and when I did I would track my calorie intake. I ran everyday. I puked out every thing I've ate. I've lost a ton of weight but it wasn't enough for me. 

It got so bad that i had to go to the hospital. 

After that I realized I needed to change. I tried to eat regularly. I went vegan to convince myself to eat. I got rid of my weighing scale and my full body mirror (I constantly check my weight and my reflection to see if i gained weight or looked fat). I ended up trying out for our cheerleading team and that motivated me to continue eating so I wouldn't faint during my training.

For awhile I felt happy with my body. I was fit and healthy. I had no thought and signs of my eating disorder. I stopped counting calories and enjoyed eating. I realized how much I miss eating food. I got in a relationship soon after  My boyfriend is also an athlete with a high calorie intake so we would constantly go out to eat or go to buffets.

After game season ended we stopped training for a bit and I gained weight. 

I cried when i saw my body at the mirror. I cried when i saw my weight. I cried when i realized my pants don't fit anymore. 

I've been binge eating and I'd purge right after. I'm back to working out everyday. I'm so lost since I struggled so hard to recover and now I'm relapsing so hard.

1249,c1lsdz,Request: Is it body dysmorphia ?,"I’ve been vegetarian for about two months now and I have started to go to the gym sevral times a week. I stopped drinking soda and am trying to live by the “only eat when you’re reallyyyy hungry “ mindset. I really try to have a positive focus and  I know progress will be slow but worth it.  I’ve been having horrible jealousy and even some hate in my heart toward thin women. I’ve had to block my thinner friends and even my sister off of social media because I want to vomit thinking about how much better they look than me. I can’t even see them get compliments without wanting to just disappear. 
I guess I just wish I could look thin as easy as them. They are healthy weight I am overweight. 
I don’t treat them any differently and I love them but I get a gut wrenching feeling and sometimes my day is even ruined just by seeing their selfies. I’ll start to feel like nothing compared to them and I feel like I’m  heavier instantly. 
Like today was great. I actually took pictures I felt so pretty and proud of my progress so far. Then my sister posted a selfie and I got thrown into emotion. I felt sad and heavy and ugly and disgusting. I even asked my long term boyfriend if he thought she was prettier then me. It makes me so toxic I hate it :( 

I just feel like it’s only petty  jealousy and not justifiably a mental health issue. 

I also have struggled with feeling like everybody is constantly staring at my fat or judging me on my weight. I hide my legs and chin when I sit bc they get wider when I move my legs or look down.  Is that normal though? 

Am i wrong for the jelousy? Is this body dysmorphia? How do I get over this and quit comparing and judging myself? I know I’m my own person with my own journey. I don’t want to hate my sister, friends, and peers, I want to celebrate their confidence but I can’t. Do I talk to them about it? Are people really aware and judging my weight?

1251,c18a4c,Request: Anon Post,"I have a teen sibling hat has come out to me and another sibling about having an eating disorder. I am not a doctor, but thensibling in question shows purging and non purging behaviors. I am an adult and out of my parents house, so I told my parents what she told me and they don't believe there is anything wrong. Other then her coming out to me, my other sibling and myself have noticed suspicious behavior like: Excessive exorcise (hours of walking around outiside), disapearing in the bathroom after eating at reasturants, having extreme anxiety when ordering food, drinking 8+ cups of coffee a day, they went through a period of rapid weight loss (used to be over weight now is skinny but not under weight), my other sibling has found what might be puke in their bathtub, they complain of chest pain and acid reflux.  
    My parents ignore my text messages that report these behaviors to them. They refuse to talk to me about these behaviors and I'm worried about the safety of my sibling. I finally got a one text message response after multiple texts stating my concern. This was what they said
         ""I think she's fine I told her last night she needs to start eating bland food and no acidic foods she has the rest stomach and let it heal last night her stomach was bothering her and she was eating tomato soup I told her you can't eat it it's all acidic so I told her to have some bland stuff white toast with no butter nothing spicy and the dentist would tell if there was something wrong because her teeth would be damaged if she was  bulimic and the orthodontist would know too. I am sure her acid in her stomach is high but she needs to start eat properly so her stomach heals I think she my need to get medication for her stomach to help get rid of the acid,she eat every night I always see her get in the refrigerator after we eat then so goes and eats something""
    I corrected them and told them that the dentist wouldn't be able to tell untill about 2 years of purging and that all depends on oral hygiene. I also told them that of course you see her eat you just don't see her purge. They are also basically admiting that they think telling the sibling in question to eat right is enough to make them do so.  They didnt respond to my text correcting their ignorance. I even offered to drive the sibling in question to the doctor incase they didnt have time to take the sibling in question themselves. (I have been begging them to at least bring her in for nutrition test and a psychiatric evaluation). 
     A few days later the sibling in question admited to the sibling that also lives with my parents that they were puking again. Apparently the aibling in question has ""mastered making puke sound like they are taking a number 2"". I text my parents with screen shots of my other sibling telling me this. No response.  
    I don't know what to do. My parents are trying to deny there is a problem until we all shut up about it. I am concerned for my siblings safety and recovery. I've even considered reporting them to child services but of course that comes at a heavy toll. Can I report them for neglect of a child? Should I report them? I need advice on what to do. I totally don't understand why they aren't freaking out, if that was my kid I'd get them the help they need even if I so much as suspected it. Multiple people are TELLING my parent that the sibling in question has an eating disorder. Im very frustrated and want to get them help.

1252,c189un,Request: how to deal with freaking out about weight gain from exercise,"I have struggled with eating issues for a long time, but have been doing pretty well recovering from anorexia now for a few years. However, one thing I still fixate on is my numerical weight, and it’s hard for me to let go of the association that below a certain number = good, and above a certain number = catastrophically bad. 
Recently, I’ve decided to start exercising consistently for me first time. I always used to control my weight purely through restricting my diet, but for various reasons I’ve realized that I need to build up my athleticism as well. Since I’ve started exercising, I’ve noticed some significant improvements in my digestion, insomnia, and mood. Unfortunately it’s also allowed myself to feel like I can eat more too.
Today i stepped on the scale for the first time since I’ve begun exercising, and saw that I gained 5 pounds. I am now above my threshold weight value. I completely freaked out. My partner tells me that the weight shouldn’t matter if I am feeling healthier, but my mind keeps going around in circles due to the association I have with this number being a hard threshold for my attractiveness and self-worth. I keep revisiting all my recent interactions with people I’ve met and am now having a hard time not attributing their perceived coldness and indifference to this weight gain. I feel stupid for allowing myself to eat more in conjunction with working out, since I should’ve known that being skinny requires a combination of diet and exercise.
R/eatingdisorders, please help me, I feel like I am spiraling. I feel like this higher number invalidates all the good I’ve gotten from the exercise, because if I am fat then none of the other, less tangible stuff like mood and digestion matters.

I found one near me that’s free and fits with my schedule, but for some reason, I just can’t convince myself to actually go. I know I should go, and I WANT to go, but I’m really nervous/anxious/scared of going. I’m afraid I won’t fit in, or that I don’t look enough like I have an ED, or that I’ll say or do something “wrong”. Does anyone have any ideas for how I can convince myself to go to the group?

1263,c0da4g,"Request: Is this a relapse, a new ED, or unrelated?"," 

I struggled with restricting and purging from puberty through early college, when I finally got treatment for anorexia. I’ve been in recovery for so many years that I don’t think of myself as “in recovery.”

BUT

I received a diagnosis that so far has only been manageable through a restrictive diet. I work with a dietitian to ensure that I’m eating enough. I’m currently on the border of overweight and health weight. Of note, I don’t think I’ve ever talked about my ED history with my current dietitian.

About 6-8 weeks ago I was either exposed to an allergen or some kind of gastro bug so bad that I landed in the hospital for a few days and my recovery took a couple weeks. My dietitian had me back on the most restrictive version of my medical diet until I was able to eat enough volume to begin reintroducing foods.

The experience through me for a loop and I had a lot of anxiety around eating and I enjoyed the weight loss a little too much and noticed some ED thoughts recurring for the first time in years. I got myself back in therapy which is helping with the general health scare anxiety but not the ED thoughts.

My dietitian gave me the ok to reintroduce a specific class of foods, and I thought all was going well for a week or so but then I had a huge, awful resurgence of symptoms, felt like I was gonna land back in the hospital, it was awful. To be safe I backed off of the new foods, and the symptoms subsided significantly but not entirely. I’m getting checked out by my doc to make sure everything’s good health wise and so far they think so.

Since then I’ve been terrified to eat. I’m restricting again. I feel out of control and like I have only two “safe” foods. It doesn’t help that a store employee sold me a food item after I had asked about my allergens and said it was fine but then when I went to eat it, it very visibly had the allergens I asked about. I got a refund but the principle of feeling like there are no safe foods or places to eat is getting to me.

I don’t want to eat, I’m eating much less than even half of what I should be, and I feel out of control. Mealtime makes me so anxious. I can’t stand eating around people in case I get sick. But it’s not about body image or control (well maybe a little control), like a lot of my original ED was, so I’m not sure if seeking treatment makes sense, but I’m not sure where else to turn to.

My therapist keeps saying it takes time, and I trust her but we haven’t gone over my ED history or my thinking about going back to an IOP or something yet. I just feel like I can’t stand the stress of eating anymore, and my therapist is out of town, so I called a local ED place and am waiting to hear back about a phone assessment but I don’t know what to expect or if it was the right call.

Is what I’m going through considered a relapse, or a different ED, or not related? Any thoughts?",1560470209,6/13/2019 18:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/c0da4g/request_is_this_a_relapse_a_new_ed_or_unrelated/,2

I am overweight. At the moment I wait too long to eat, then eat too much to compensate. I'm trying to move to a better eating schedule, but I still feel unsatisfied after eating a healthy portion.

This would be fine (I'm sure I could eventually get used to it as my stomach un-stretches), but when I feel hungry, I feel panicky and life looks impossible. I don't get hangry, I just mire on everything that I've messed up and stare for half an hour. This, of course, means that if I don't eat on time, I then wait even longer to eat because everything seems pointless. At work this means that unless I over-eat, I can't focus on my work, so I HAVE TO over-eat.

1267,c0d726,Request: Request for advice on how to make things as easy as possible for my SO,"I'm 23F and I've been struggling with disordered eating since I was about 15 years old. I've been doing pretty OK (I've had ups and downs and have been stuck in the restict-binge cycle for some time, but no major relapses into my anorexia has occured and I've felt pretty okay most of the time) since I was 20, and last year I got a boyfriend. I love him more than anything, we're moving in together very soon and all I want is for him - and for us - to be happy. 

However, I've recently relapsed quite significantly into my eating disorder as well as suffering from a mild to moderate depression for the last six months or so. This is of course incredibly hard for us both. I've been very open with him about it all and he is super supportive, but I know he is in a lot of pain, that he worries for me, and that he's having a really hard time because of this. His support helps me and I truly appreciate everything he does to be there for me, but at the same time the guilt is smothering me. I often think about how much easier his life would be if we had never got together, and I just wish relapse wasn't a thing.. He says that he would rather have me in his life - with all my baggage - than not have me in his life at all, and that we are going to get through this. Together.

I guess what I'm wondering is: how can I make things as easy for him as possible? With this post I'm really hoping to reach out to the people of this subreddit who have been supporters, loved ones and SO's of people struggling, and to hear what helped you through the process of illness and recovery. I find it really hard to know if it is best for him that I'm completely open and share my feelings/thoughts/struggles with him, or if it's better to keep it to myself and my psychologist (when I get one, that is..)? Can I say or do anything to make him feel better and less concerned? I'm afraid he won't tell me if he's having a hard time because he knows I already have a lot on my plate. I really just want to be the best girlfriend, support and friend that I can be for him in the midst of all of this. I hope someone can help me figure out, or at least give me some pointers, on how to do just that.

I found out about her Eating disorder (bulimia) not too long after we starting dating and have been trying to be supportive about it but i've never felt like i've know what to say or how to deal with it even after deep diving like 50 articles about it. So cutting to the reason why i am here writing this out
For the past year and a half her eating disorder has been getting extremely bad, causing her to become extremely depressed, starve herself to become a ""goal weight"", and now become overweight due to bing/purging. All of this has gone on and stress has definitly contributed to all of this. She started university and is currently in her 2nd year, her parents have created a very toxic environment at home with them arguing and taking out their frustrations on my partner and putting her in stressful positions. Both parents have known about her eating disorder way before i even knew my partner, and their reactions were awful. It included yelling, trying to force my partner into a mental ward in a hospital, and ripping doors off in the house to prevent purging and hiding stuff. Even now, they have gotten better but respond to situations that clearly show my partner is going through something with to do with her eating disorder with ""get over it"" or ""don't eat as much"" and act with ignorance. 
She's tried to commit suicide twice over the past year and a half and has been self harming
She's been self harming more often and more severely recently even now she's seeing a new councelor and psychiatrist
She's been advised to go to an outpatient facility but she is threatened and feels uncomfortable by that idea
I am extremely afraid that she is going to attempt suicide again and i don't know what to do so i've turned to reddit
Do i tell her i feel she should go to an outpatient facility
Do i try and talk to her parents about this beforehand even though their parents are partially ignorant (admittedly her mom is slightly better about it and is currently trying to be better about it so i'd only talk to her)

I’ve had a very unhealthy relationship with food probably my entire life.

I’ve lost about 50 pounds and only 30 away from my goal! This being said, I have to make a conscious effort to make sure I have a decent relationship with food, but I will never ever be like a normal person who can have a whole and healthy relationship with it that doesn’t come with fear and hatred towards food. But that’s fine, I’ve accepted that and I’m coping with it. I’ve found what works for me and I’m practicing that. That is not the problem here tho. Since I associate bad food with bad feelings for me I have this horrible nasty habit of judging anyone who is over weight for eating bad foods. I hate it and I feel disgusting for even admitting this. I am ALL about body positivity and any size being beautiful. I follow all body positive accounts and preach about size inclusivity/ body confidence/ self love. I truly believe in it! And I strive to have a mindset where I don’t hyper analyze and judge others. In the (far) future when I have a daughter I want her to have a relationship with food that I didn’t have. I try not to but sometimes in public I’ll unintentionally shame (of course to myself) anyone over weight for eating badly. I have a few overweight friends and seeing their food choices/fridge etc the first thing that comes to my mind is a judging sort of thought process followed by me yelling at myself like “stop it! It’s their body and you’re only projecting on to other people who do not have a bad relationship with food.” Even if they’re over weight, they eat pretty normal for the most part but occasionally will have some junk. And that’s normal!!!?? So why is my subconscious always pointing this out to me as bad? I can probably answer my own question by saying it’s my self projecting my own negative feelings on to others and I want this to stop so bad. I truly and genuinely believe at any size if you have confidence and self love you have a glow that makes you beautiful. I just don’t know why food triggers something in my head! I hope nobody takes this the wrong way because i so desperately want to stop and have made conscious attempts not to. I know it’s my own fault and has nothing to do with these people. Side note, growing up my mom ALWAYS makes comments on what her and everyone around her is eating, so maybe it’s just engraved in my brain? Ugh I hope I’m not a horrible person or triggering anyone.

He has told me over and over that ED’s are really common, that my thoughts and feelings are common, and now has told me that I’m just going to have to start eating and that he doesn’t understand why I should need to take it slow. 

He is not specialized in ED, but that’s like my only option around here that is affordable (small town).

1282,c4c520,Request: No appetite since I started new antidepressants,"Hi, I hope it's ok for me to post here since I don't have an ED. But I figured people here might still be able to help me with my problem.

I suffer from depression since my early teens and have tried different antidepressants since maybe a bit more than 1 year. I finally found some that work really well for me but they killed my appetite completly. On the first day I didn't eat anything at all because I simply forgot about it. I felt no hunger at all. I realized that on day 2 and since then I have to force myself to eat and I have alarms on my phone to remind myself to do it. But I'm eating only half as much as I ate before I changed meds, I can't physically bring myself to swallow more. (I am at a healthy weight but already lost some)

I really don't want to change meds again because those are the first ones that really work for me. So I could really use tips how to deal with this. Any tricks for eating more without appetite? Or maybe some protein shakes to recommend?

1283,c3o15e,Request: Anorexia to bed," 

Hi guys my weight has been on a wild journey over the past 18months our so. M/25/6'4""

Jan 2018, slightly in the ""overweight"" BMI range, I started restrictive dieting (always into lifting but had an extra bit of fat so I was trying to lean down a bit) . Lost a lot of weight over the next few months. At this point I realized I was underweight and I needed to gain. Unfortunately I started doing so by binging. Often times this includes excess salt, sugar and carbs. The three things I was most restrictive about during my diet.

Over the next few months, I gained most of that original weight back. I now noticiably have some extra fat on me and a nice belly. I feel like the binge eating train has taken off and is very difficult for me to stop.

I have also felt a lot of weird symptoms while eating more. These include constant fatigue, facial and leg swelling, headaches, drowsiness

These weight fluctuations are def not good for my body. I want to settle at a healthy weight while eating 3 healthy normal meals a day

Anyone have any tips or advice or insights",1561198371,6/22/2019 5:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/c3o15e/request_anorexia_to_bed/,5

1285,c3nyl7,Request: How do I encourage my wife to get more serious help?,"I've been with my wife for about 10 years (married for 8). I'm 43, she's 38. We have two girls, 5 and 1. I'm looking for advice on how to get her better help.

About a year into dating, she revealed to me that she ""sometimes likes to throw up"" after eating. At first I thought she was kidding, as we were having a light hearted conversation, but she was dead serious.

After we moved in together, I noticed the purging and encouraged her to talk to her GP because it seemed to be starting to affect her health. I think she did that. Eventually, she stopped purging most of the time from what I could tell. There is still binging that comes along with it, at varying levels. 

Lately, she doesn't eat dinner with the kids and me and instead I'll find dirty dishes and empty containers hours afterward.

This has been going on since she was in college (almost 20 years now), and I just don't know if there's anything I can do to encourage her to make changes. 

Possibly the bigger issue is what I understand is a big component of eating disorders: not knowing how to handle emotions and turning to food instead. Strong emotions bring out a ton of anger at times - even leading to mild violence toward me in the past. I am wary of talking with her about controversial topics between us / hard family topics because she'll just get furious -- even if it's something she knows we need to discuss.

I don't think I can stay married to her if she can't get the right help.

She does go to a therapist but I have only been seeing her issues get worse since our second daughter was born. She gained weight after our first daughter and much more before and after our second.

I've read the posts here on ""how to talk to your loved one,"" etc., but I've frankly gone down many of those paths in the past decade. She has gotten help, but I don't think it has been the right help.

You'll noticed a lot of ""I thinks"" above. She often tells me that she's doing something to help herself, but then I find out that she lied about it. I want to be there for her (and I think I usually am), but it's super hard without knowing the truth about what's going on for her.

So, how do I talk to her about getting help without triggering her fury? Also - where do spouses go for support, if anywhere?

-----

Related, but selfish: There's things that come along with her disorder that bug me. She just won't accept that they're issues for me and gets angry at me if I bring them up. This is really secondary to finding a way to get her help, but I sort of want to have the freedom to say it aloud, so here goes:

- Eating treats that I buy for myself and not telling me until I discover they're gone
- Making a mess of food waste, wrappers, etc when she does binge without cleaning up after herself
- When purging, not cleaning up vomit around the toilet and other places it splatters",1561197821,6/22/2019 5:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/c3nyl7/request_how_do_i_encourage_my_wife_to_get_more/,8
1286,c3nxxm,Request: I can't deal with this on my own any longer,"Hi there. 
I have been slowly devolving into what I believe is bullimia. Basically, I began exercising and using MyFitnessPal like two and a half years ago. I started at too low of calories, would last a few days, then binge. I upped my calories, would last a week or two, then binge. I began making tweaks to my diet/exercise to reduce the binges. The effective changes included returning to basic CICO with less strict rules about macros and 'bad' foods, fasting longer earlier in the day to accommodate my stronger feelings of hunger later in the day, and adding some cardio which seems to reset my appetite/declutter my brain. 

I was doing pretty well for a while. Binges were smaller, less frequent, and more controlled, and often I could easily offset them by eating a bit less the next day or moving more. I think I was doing my best with a routine, with knowing when my hunger strikes, with knowing when I would have the energy to work out, and maximizing this knowledge to stay fit while still enjoying food. Then I really fell off the wagon due to a complete loss of routine. I got really busy socially at the end of the year- drinking alcohol much more, eating weird food at weird times. I began taking more creative (a.k.a unhealthy) measures to avoid weight gain- I would skip dinner if I knew I would go out drinking that night, I would spend a day after a big drinking day on Adderall and consuming only water or gatorade zero all day. Then I started cutting corners more, which led to self-induced vomiting. If I got drunk and ate junk, I couldn't just move on, I instead would go in the bathroom and try to puke up all the calories I could. Honestly, it felt like a resolution to my struggle: I could still be ""cool"" and drink beer and eat pizza with my friends, yet stay thin. 

But it started to spiral into a habit. I came home from college and spent my free weeks before starting my job in a totally wacky state of mind. I would binge on foods until my stomach hurt then throw up. If I didn't want to keep doing that, I would buy junk food, chew it, and then spit it out. If I binged and didn't vomit, I would try to fast binges away in the days after. 

I feel like switches are flipping on and off in my mind. I feel like I am completely consumed in an ongoing battle of wanting to stay thin, and wanting to eat everything. One day, I'll eat reasonably, exercise, and go to bed without even a typical nighttime snack. The next, all I can think about is food, and I'll challenge myself to not eat, and then something triggers me and I lose myself in another binge. Every time I think I'm finally feeling normal again, I suddenly get the emptiest feeling in my stomach and all I want to do is give myself the freedom to eat whatever. Then I do it, I eat one cookie, and I immediately feel mad that I'm reversing my progress. Then I say well it's fucked and I eat way past feeling satiated. Then I get mad again and I make myself throw up or starve the next day. I'm sure this sounds familiar.

It's not necessarily the actions of bingeing or purging that are infesting my life, but the way this whole cycle consumes every waking moment. I feel like I have no concept of hunger nor fullness. I am constantly planning in my head how I will avoid calories/meals and burn enough calories that day. I struggle to commit to social plans if they surround eating. If I don't let myself have that one muffin, I crave it for hours after. If I do let myself have it, I feel intense guilt for hours after. If I'm out with friends and know I'm going home soon, I intensely brainstorm the perfect snack at home that will optimize deliciousness for the lowest calories. 

So yes, I think I have an eating disorder, and I think it's becoming more and more intrusive on my life. I set up an appointment with an ED specialist, then I just ghosted her out of total fear. It's been a week and I have still been too ashamed to call her back. 

I am begging for someone to please tell me one thing I can begin to change right now. It doesn't have to be a grand action. I just want someone to see hope in my situation.",1561197686,6/22/2019 5:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/c3nxxm/request_i_cant_deal_with_this_on_my_own_any_longer/,2
1287,c3nwjo,Request: Want to gain weight but I don't enjoy food," 

I’ve never thought of myself having an eating disorder. I have always been a picky eater. I have always simply eaten when I am hungry. I’ve never restricted myself. Ive always been underweight, but not as underweight as i am now. I DESPERATELY want to gain weight. I don’t like being skinny. I want to gain \*\* pounds. I’ve been trying to gain these \*\* pounds for over 2 years. But I just don’t enjoy eating. I take a few bites of something and, even though my stomach isn’t full yet, I no longer have the desire to eat. I basically only eat the bare minimum to shut my stomach up. I set alarms to remind myself to eat, but nothing sounds good. Ever. I try to think of literally any fast food/restaurant, ANYTHING that might sound good to me, and nothing. Nothing ever sounds good. I am always forcing my food down. Sometimes I choose to eat foods that are easy to swallow just so I don’t have to gag while chewing. I just want to be able to enjoy food like a normal person. I’ve tried working out to stimulate my appetite, but nothing changes. I am more hungry, but I still don’t want to eat.

I have no idea where this comes from. I’ve always been a picky eater, but at least as a kid I enjoyed the things that I did like. I don’t enjoy anything about food now and I don’t know why. Is this a real thing? Because there is no way this is just all in my head. After a few bites chewing anything makes me gag. I go a full day without eating because nothing sounds good. I usually also feel nauseous. And then I beat myself up about it because I will never reach my goal weight this way. I force my food down by putting it in my mouth and then drinking a ton of water. And I usually cry while doing it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Why can’t I love food? Everyone around me is always eating these bigger meals and I get so jealous. If I could eat like that I could have a chance at reaching my goal weight. But i just can’t put the food down.

This is my first ever practical step towards addressing my issue and I hope there is someone who can help me.

In one month, I have dropped a significant amount of my body weight. I am absolutely exhausted. In the first week or so I would go one to three days with no food, now I occasionally go one day but tend to eat most days.

My memory, energy levels, social life, emotions and relationships have taken an enormous wallop and I will not ignore the fact that it is not only my eating but chiefly my own behaviour and other psychological issues which have contributed to my difficulties, including the issues with food itself.

I am now a “healthy” weight whereas before I was the most overweight I’d ever been. This weight came on more steadily than it has been lost, but was still at a rather rapid rate. This time last year, I was at the upper end of healthy range and maintained this though a healthy lifestyle.

I know I need to fix this but it just seems silly - I will put on weight and might become overweight again. I know that where I was at before was better than where I am now but neither is healthy and I am a small girl, the actual weight in question is not that much.  I feel it is a very difficult line to tread and to look at it clinically might lead to even further obsession.

I’ve (15f) been struggling with disordered eating for the past couple of months, and when I first told one of my friends about how I was kinda worried for my health, he told “well you look like you’ve gained some weight so I bet there’s nothing to worry about.” This threw me into a total spiral, and I got really bad. He’s since gotten a little better supporting me, but it made me extremely scared to tell my best friends about it.

I was at my best friend’s house (let’s call her Angie) with her as well as my other friend (we’ll call her Brianna) and when I said I wasn’t hungry Angie said “I see you reading the back of everything lately” and then she was basically screaming about how i’m just gonna end up dying and that I need to stop counting calories now. (she doesn’t know about anything else i’d been doing). When Brianna told her to stop because I was so uncomfortable, Angie said that it was just making her so angry because she hates lying. I eventually got her to shut up about it by swearing not to count calories anymore. I know she didn’t mean anything about it and she was trying to help, but it made me feel like I couldn’t come to her.

I told her a couple days ago that I really just need her on my side right now, especially because I have a lot of things going on right now that’s too much for me to handle, and she basically just says I need to try harder with getting better and i’m close minded.How can I talk to her without her blowing up on me?

1298,c8eess,Request: I'm new - looking for advice about a potential ED,"Hi, I'm new to Reddit so pretty unsure what the protocols are, sorry if any Reddit jokes go right over my head. Also, sorry for the long post.

I'm worried I might have an ED. I've read articles from various sources explaining what they are and what the symptoms and 'criteria' for a particular diagnosis are...some things fit me, but honestly, most don't. I don't fit the stereotypes about people with EDs either. But I struggle with food so much sometimes, I can't help but think something must be wrong.

I'm very prone to anxiety and have frequent highly depressive episodes, that have been known to veer into dangerous territories. So maybe my experiences are just further symptoms of that. When I get into these depressive periods of my life, I start to have these issues. I lose my appetite and have to force myself to eat. I'll eat the same few types of things for days, and then suddenly want to avoid those things for weeks. I stare in the mirror and think about how if I just waited, skipped a few meals until I was so hungry I had to eat, and even then ate as little as possible, maybe I'd lose weight. I've been told by several people recently that I've lost weight. I find myself looking at my body and thinking 'fat', reaching for snacks and either turning away with thoughts of how I'm heavy enough already or I guilt myself while I eat them, thinking that I'm a selfish pig. I feel good when I go without eating successfully, and feel secretly proud when I manage to 'forget' about eating for days. I can remember several times when I've pretended to friends that I'd just been so distracted and un-hungry as a reason for why I'd missed many meals to, knowing I was looking for validation I was doing a good thing. Other days though, I can't seem to eat enough to make the hunger go away.

Does this sound to you like symptoms of a potential ED? And if so - which one? I ask that second question because I'm sure there are many currently officially unrecognised EDs that I won't have found any info on.

1302,c892ho,Request: Why am I fixated on this?,"Hey all, I’ve had an ED for many, many years. I am working toward recovery and have been seeing a therapist. 

One thing I’m having a really hard time letting go of is the way that others see me. I feel like, before I fully commit to recovery, I have to know if I look “sick enough”. What started this was that my husband told me I looked “thin, but not too thin” and it made me mad because I’ve put so much work into being a thinner version of myself, though dangerously, but now I feel like I did all of this for nothing. I know that this sounds unbelievably shallow and I don’t know why I’m feeling this way, but I guess I am.  

I am really scared that once I stop my ED, people will really noticed the weight I’ve put on as well and compare me to my former self.  

Any advice would be really appreciated. I appreciate this group a lot.",1562073197,7/2/2019 8:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/c892ho/request_why_am_i_fixated_on_this/,7
1303,c7qkgn,Request: How can I help myself?,"I’ve struggled with what I call “disordered eating” for a year once July hits. Last spring, I decided I wanted to lose a little weight for a wedding I was attending. 

Out came good ol’ My Fitness Pal, and by tracking my calories, I was able to lose the weight I wanted. When I did, I had never felt better about myself. I was more confident and proud of myself for what I had accomplished. I kept tracking calories and weighing myself, which lead to me saying, “I want to lose just a few more pounds.”

Enter the restricting and binging cycle. At first I would just feel guilty eating a few extra treats, but it slowly turned into binges. I was at my worst last fall, eating so much in secret at night until I felt so sick I couldn’t sleep. The guilt the next day was tremendous. 

As school started up, I probably told myself a 10000 times, “OK. diet starts tomorrow and i’ll track calories again.” I wanted to lose the weight I had gained from the binges the same way I lost it in the first place. Because when I lost it I found it all relatively unproblematic. But I honestly hate tracking calories. It makes me food obsessive, and I get mad feeling like I have to restrict so much. So then comes another binge. 

Around Christmas, I said “screw it” and just ate whatever the hell I wanted but told myself I wouldn’t binge because I could eat whatever I wanted. This put me at my heaviest weight. 

I used to love working out; my days didn’t feel right if I didn’t in the morning. But since that Christmas, I haven’t wanted to exercise at all. I ended up dealing with the whole gym anxiety thing where you think you look so fat and everyone knows it. 

I just want a healthy relationship with food. Sometimes I feel so dumb because who the heck doesn’t know how to just eat. The problem is, I still want to lose this weight i’ve gained in the past year. The most i’ve been able to go on said “diet &amp; tracking” is maybe 1.5 weeks before i give up and eat a ton of food. 

It’s been this cycle for a year. I still don’t want to get in the gym and am afraid to exercise again. I wear clothes incredibly big and baggy because I’m so self conscious of my body. I’ve gone through so much self-loathing. My school is also the biggest stressor in my life (premed), and I really don’t want to go another year struggling with this. 

I’m not anorexic nor purging. I wouldn’t call them “binges” these days but it’s overeating for sure. I’m just not sure what to do at this point.",1561974073,7/1/2019 4:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/c7qkgn/request_how_can_i_help_myself/,3

1306,c7karh,Request: My post,"Lately, I’ve been finding myself falling back into my old eating habits. I’ve never been one to resort to bulimia but repressing my hunger. My body refuses to puke, even when I’m nauseous or sick. I’ve tried to stick my toothbrush and fingers to the back of my throat but I’ve only received a gag reflex and no vomit. From there, bulimia was out of the picture. There came another alternative, coffee.

In highschool, I would drink an excessive amount of coffee to cut off my desire for food in order to feel better about myself. My body was no where near par to the other girls who attended my school. I would go for periods of time drinking coffee in replacement of my meals. I would consume no food and drink coffee instead. Eventually, my body would get to a point of exhaustion and need food so I gave in. When I ate the food, I would eat and eat, extending way past satisfaction. Then, I would feel like I needed to starve myself again. I did that again. Again. And again. Finally, about a two years of doing this, my brother’s girlfriend, now fiancé, caught on and helped me cope. We started eating regularly together and my diet was regulated. Since then I’ve been maintaining a decent diet keeping my anemia in control. 

About two years later, now presently, I haven’t eaten in two days and have consumed four cups (12 oz per serving) of coffee. Not eating just makes me feel so much better about myself and I don’t know how to feel good without doing this. How do I prevent myself from falling back into my old habits and control portions?",1561932483,6/30/2019 17:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/c7karh/request_my_post/,1

1308,c7ka8y,Request: New post,"Disordered eating caused by depression and exhaustion?

**TL;DR I’m experiencing a concerning level of disordered eating as a result of narcolepsy and depression, and I’m hoping this community can point me in the right direction of where to find help. I don’t even know where to start.**

The deets:

[Real quick - for those not familiar, the main symptom of narcolepsy is called “excessive daytime sleepiness.” It’s the equivalent of operating on 2-3 days of sleep deprivation.]

For the past 1.5-2 months I’ve been struggling with increasingly disordered eating. During this time I had severe depression. I also have narcolepsy (diagnosed 2 years ago) and am taking meds for that, but haven’t yet found the right ones. Those that I currently take suppress appetite, and the most recent one I was trying to switch to frequently made me nauseous and dizzy for most of the following day. As a result I would sleep half the day and had a poor time tolerating food when I was awake. When I did eat, it was very minimal and rarely healthy or balanced. (It doesn’t help that I was already a poor cook to begin with.)

So basically, I was stuck in this perfect storm of depression which impacts my motivation or desire to eat, exhaustion which destroys my ability to prepare food or even go grocery shopping, and feeling ill or having a poor appetite from my medication.

I’m finally out of the depression and seeing progress on being awake for more than 6 hours, but now whenever I try to eat I get nauseous and barely eat any of my meal. I’m still not eating regularly enough, either, since I haven’t recovered my appetite. Because of all this, I’m dizzy a lot, and I’ve had a significant and rapid loss of weight.

The narcolepsy community has recommended I try meal planning, which I’m sure will help, but I’m afraid I still won’t eat enough even though there will be easy food available.

I’m really fucking worried about myself, but I don’t know where to begin with seeking treatment. That’s why I’m reaching out to your community. I’m hoping that you might be able to help me find professional advice or point me in the right direction. I’ve not been diagnosed with an eating disorder, but I sure as hell have fallen into a pattern of disordered eating that is having a negative effect on my health and life.

Relevant: I have a psych at a mood disorder clinic, and see a therapist about twice a month - though I haven’t seen either of them since this got bad.

I’ve been dealing with extreme hunger at nights for the past few months, and although I’ve somehow managed to not gain an extreme amount of weight, for some reason now that I have my period back I feel as though that hunger isn’t justified. For the past few days, after my “episodes” of eating, I’ve gone in the bathroom and purged. Today, I had the hunger urges ALL day, and I’ve given into them but sadly that led to multiple purging episodes. Since I’m at a healthy weight now, all I want is to STOP my binges because I feel as though that’s the only part of my disorder that’s still heavy on me.

1311,c7k9lt,Request: request for post — is this binge eating,"I’ve been struggling with anorexia for the past 2 years, have reached a low weight and been recommended for inpatient (something i’m really trying not to do), and have been trying to just eat more by myself/without following a meal plan or anything while I try to figure out where i’m going to get treatment. since trying to eat more (so like the past week), I went from eating a low amount of calories a day to eating a more normal/slightly above normal amount—but i find that even after eating all of that food, i’m still STARVING and nothing can satiate me. A big thing for me is also not eating during the day, so i consume all these calories in like a 3-4 hour window before bed... I’m just wondering if this counts as bingeing?? It feels pretty out of control to me and sometimes i feel really full but starving at the same time. My dietician said it’s just my body wanting food after being starved for so long, but idk...I just don’t want to go from one extreme (restricting) to the other (overeating), i want to be somewhere in the middle—So this eating tons and not feeling full really scares me, not to mention messes with my digestion and makes me feel like i’m just packing on so much weight.

1319,cb9lxk,Request: Post Request,"Hello there, 

I have a question when it comes to vacationing and how others handle the mental anguish that can accompany that.

Background. I'm 30. I've entered an outpatient anorexia recovery program in March '18. I am fully weight restored, my period has been back since August, and in many ways, I am thriving. However, there are days, especially lately, where I really continue to struggle. For me, the weight restoration phase of treatment wasn't incredibly difficult mentally. I knew I was severely underweight. Even when I hit the low point of a ""normal"" weight range, I was fine because I was still very thin, clothes still hung off of me, etc. 

Things have changed since then. For the first time in my life, I have cellulite and it's been really hard for me to wrap my head around as I do take fitness very seriously (I work in the industry as a trainer and work as an associate editor for a large, online fitness organization. I'm also aware that people can be fit and have cellulite! It's just sooo new for me). For the first time in about 4 years, things don't fit me anymore and I have a different reaction every damn time I try someone on that's too small. About two months ago, a top I wore at the same time a year ago no longer fit me. I was stoked because my muscles and boobs were back! About two weeks ago, a pair of pants didn't fit me. I laughed it off and threw them away. I was honest-to-god proud that I actually have a butt and hips now. Today, I put on a pair of shorts (my favorite pair) to go to the store and this new butt that I have, that most days I'm super excited about, said NOPE. It made me feel awful and like I've failed despite KNOWING that I'm consciously doing things in the gym to grow my glutes and legs back to their pre-anorexia size and strength (I'm an avid weightlifter and cyclist); despite KNOWING that I'm healthier; that I have a sex drive again; that I have energy again; that I look and feel womanly and feminine again; despite knowing that even at my THINNEST one of the areas in question was still a ""problem"" area (albeit not as ""problematic"") simply because that's where my body stores fat and *more* fat in that area means that I am healthy and thriving and that's a good thing. I just can't shake feeling disappointed in myself and like I've ""let myself go."" 

I don't think I'd be having such a hard time with this if I wasn't going to Italy on Friday for ten days. A year+ ago, I would have severely restricted leading up to a trip. I would have worked out 2-3x a day. I haven't done that this time around. I keep saying I'm going to try to at least eat a tiny bit less, but then I get hungry and I eat (mind-blowing, I know), but... when those damn shorts didn't fit, I immediately felt like a weak, undisciplined subpar human being for not being ""stronger"" and for not having the ""willpower"" to lose a certain amount of weight/restrict my intake prior to Italy. Now, I feel like I can't enjoy myself on my trip because I'll just come home ""even bigger."" 

I plan on trying to enjoy myself and I know that this is just Ana talking, but some days just suck and I'm scared of how I'll react when I get home knowing that I will likely gain a little when I'm there. On one hand, this trip is a HUGE accomplishment for me because I accepted the invitation -- I said yes. When I was asked to go on a similar trip with my father last year, I declined because I wouldn't be able to track my intake. My life back then was a series of ""No's"" scattered between bland meals and forced workouts. On the other hand, while it sounds silly, I'm genuinely scared. I'm very anxious and confused and I don't understand how people can just go somewhere and not think about what a particular food will or will not do to their bodies. I thought I kicked this and this trip has shown me that I still have a lot of work to do.

If anyone has any mantras or words of wisdom or coping strategies that they have in place when they go on vacation (or when they get back from vacation...I'm really worried about that whole ordeal), I'm all ears.",1562719749,7/9/2019 19:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cb9lxk/request_post_request/,1

Please I can use any advice I can get at this point I feel so trapped and well actually in denial / though I know things are really scaring me.

I’ve been struggling with restricting eating and alternately bingeing and purging for 4 years and it’s only getting worse. 

My thought process around food is so twisted I can’t wrap my head around normal eating or what’s ok anymore. I minimize restricting and purging behaviors. 

But all the purging now- makes it hard to breathe after and that’s so scary. 

I don’t want to die from this. I really don’t and I think it’s bad but somehow I rationalize it each time even though every time I purge I say it’ll be the last time.

This whole consultation I went through they recommended strongly over and over every time I kept asking, really?, they said I need to temporarily stop working and do a full time day treatment or residential treatment.

But I’m so afraid. And it’s hard to make that change. - too easy to make excuses like how will I pay rent, how will I afford it, I can’t have anyone know... etc... 

But then again I think- what is 4-10 weeks versus not being able to stop? Because I just can’t stop even with therapy and psychiatrist right now.

Plus I’m so consumed by depression and ptsd and work stress I don’t even feel capable of making any life decision let alone this big one.

I told the dietitian about this, as well as what was going on in my life, plus that pork, chicken, and beef, had started giving me vivid nightmares. I was told that I had a type of subconscious eating disorder that any time I'm stressed, anxious, depressed, or dysphoric, my body would completely ignore hunger cues! Great, that should be easy to fix, right?

Well, now that I knew about it, it turned from subconscious to me actively avoiding people who would notice me not eating. I realized that I hated my body for more reasons than it wasn’t female. Now I hated my stomach that isn’t flat, the giggle in my arms, and the chin I get if I look down.

I like to think that going vegan “cured” my eating disorder in a lot of ways but in the past few months I’ve noticed that when I’m feeling particularly depressed or sad I will eat something that isn’t vegan. I don’t really want to eat it and I know how I will feel physically and mentally afterwards but I still end up doing it anyways. I always hate myself when it’s over and my body usually hates me even more. I’m now starting to think that this has sort of become its own weird twisted eating disorder within my veganism. I love being vegan and I do it for the earth, the animals, and my health so i haven’t really confided in many, especially other vegans because I worry I’ll be judged.

I wanted to lose weight before I left for Tokyo but I gained and I feel miserable and disgusting. I want to make it clear that I was never diagnosed with an eating disorder, but I vomited my food regularly, starved myself, and injured my colon with the amount of laxatives and clay I would consume. I first tried to kill myself when I was 12 and it was over feeling disgusting in my swim suit. I have never eaten healthily. 

I realized now I’m slipping back into my old habits and I don’t care. This year, I had a massive panic attack after being cyber bullied into a suicide attempt (I know, I know just block them, but I have anxiety and the feelings mounted and became overwhelming long after I deleted my Twitter) and losing my only coping mechanism for it. The sad this is I missed being so anxious I could hardly eat because feeling too anxious to eat made me feel, for a lack of a better word, delicate and in control. I miss not eating so much. I can’t explain how every day was a hell where I couldn’t move more than a few steps a day and I couldn’t clean myself and had no distraction from my constant panic but I was so, so happy that I wasn’t eating.

I am not overweight but I hate every part of my body.  I have dreams of being a model for my own clothing that I sew, and co-ords I put together. I want to start corset training, and join my universities cabaret club, I love singing, dancing, and performing but I haven’t acted in years because I feel so ashamed of how ugly I am I burst into tears even in just rehearsals with my friends around me.

I want to lose weight and go to the gym and take care of myself, I have so many aspirations that require a healthy body but every time I try and eat healthy it turns into a sick game of how long I can not eat or trying to vomit food or taking laxatives.

1341,ceg6kv,Request: Should I go on the pill with an untreated ED?,"Hello everyone. I have been struggling with bulimia and restrictive eating for over a year now. In the past 3 months I have been doing quite well for myself despite never having seen a professional about it. My mother knows but firmly believes I can get over this myself.

I have also very recently entered a relationship; my first real boyfriend and I’m very happy! He’s aware of my food issues and is overwhelmingly supportive. 

For about 3 months I had lost my period but it has returned this past May as I’ve improved! I told my bf that I don’t want to go on birth control until I’ve had my period back for at least 6 months. He is 100% ok with this and is encouraging me to go at my pace. I know birth control can lighten and make you skip periods, so I just want to be sure a light period is from birth control and not from literally dying.

My mother has made me a doctors appointment in 2 weeks time. She wants me to go on the pill as soon as I can even though I haven’t reached my 6 month mark for period restoration. She says if I get pregnant I’ll be kicked out. I’m very nervous for this appointment. I haven’t seen my doctor since I had been overweight and I am now bordering underweight for my height. I’m painfully aware that I’ll have to share my ED struggles with my doctor as I’m significantly lighter.

I guess my questions are, for those of you recovering from an ED and are on birth control, how is it? Is this safe for me? Will I even be allowed to do this? (I’m also very scared of birth control making me gain weight).

My other pressing question is, how do I tell my doctor about these things without feeling so humiliated? I’m highly embarrassed by my condition. I know I should be going to therapy as I’m still very much struggling, yet I’m scared my doctor will tell me I’m not suffering from an ED because I’ve been doing decently on my own.

1344,ce6qep,Request: From the perspective of a sibling,"B-me
S-sister

Three years ago:

I chuckled as my friend told me a joke on the bus freshman year, but the laughter faded as the buzzing on my phone was a call from my parents (led by my mother). 

“Hey B, dad and I had to go into Boston today so grandma is going to be home when you get back from school” my mother said, “S is with us so you don’t have to wait for her to get off the middle-school bus”. I was utterly confused because neither of my parents work in Boston and there is never a reason to go there other than the amazing health care. 

I got home and was greeted by grandmother who tried to give me some excuse about my sister breaking her leg and that’s why she went to the ER. So I went. 

The ER was oddly quiet as my mother sat there on the hospital bed next to my sister, who was 12 years old at the time, looking completely defeated. My sister, who we will call “S” for the sake of simplicity, was hidden under the baggy layers of her dark, oversized clothing. 

The nurse offered a sympathetic smile as she walked in.

“Hello S” the Nurse spoke, “we are going to bring in the doctor soon to check you out okay?” 

I was really confused because my sisters physical condition was fine, or so I thought. I soon found out that she tried to kill herself and performed self harm. I was indifferent. Which was weird. I never had a reaction it’s almost as if I was in shock but not shocked. I had no train of thought for the first time in my life. 

This is where we got lucky.

S immediately got into one of the treatment centers for suicide prevention at Boston children’s hospital which is a miracle because there is a very small amount of rooms available in the facility and a lot of people need them. 

Each day I would come home from school, go into Boston during the visiting hours and then drive back home which got me home at about 10-11 each night. It was terrible seeing S like that, so deranged and confused, struggling to find herself in a sea of self-hatred. 

She tried to kill herself multiple times in the facility and even attempted to run into traffic (which she learned from her roommate) when we were allowed to take her out of the facility and explore Boston with her.

Finally the day came, where she was released from residential treatment (meaning she lived at the facility) into day treatment. This means that she would do treatment like school everyday and would get to come home at night and sleep there. 

This is where she found out eating disorders existed. She stopped the suicide after about a year and then started to embrace the eating disorders. This meant that she could no longer receive treatment from the facility that we were in with her because they strictly dealt with suicide. 

We went to another treatment facility and checked her in for anorexia and bulimia (which she learned from online). This place fucked up massively. They gave S the binder of poets that were for my mother and gave my mother the binder of poets that were for S. So S learned where the medicine was stored, what the meal plans were, and most importantly how to get kicked out. 

You can get kicked out of that specific place through hurting yourself and doing self harm. (Most self harm/suicide places refuse to deal with eating disorders and eating disorder places refuse to deal with suicide). 

So my parents went to see her the next night where she proceeded to throw herself on the ground and throw fits claiming that the facility was abusing her and referring to my mother as, “mommy! Mommy!” While screaming to, “get me out!!!!” In a very toddler tone. 

I went to see her the next night. 

This night she tried to break her own finger and then bashed her own head into a dresser. This was our breaking point and we pulled her out of the facility because they were not feeding her. 

We then tried another facility, and another, and another, all the while she was missing school and getting terrible grades. My family is at a point now where the insurance company is trying to get her into the next best facility because she had not made any progress over the past two years. (This is because she refuses and does not want to change). This facility is 23 hours away.. and my family is breaking apart. 

I can’t even explain the hardships that my parents face and the abuse that they put up with on a daily basis. The family of a person with an eating disorder is affected more than you would think, and to see S continue this way for so long is awful to put it lightly. 

I want to hear from other siblings, I want to know what has worked for you and your sibling and what hasn’t. We have tried everything and S is one of the worst cases in America. I know that she will not change until she wants to change, but how does one make that happen?

1349,cdv3eh,Request: How can I help my friend?," 

Hello all.

Lately I have grown more concerned for a friend of mine.

He struggled very hard with eating disorders in high school. He was in and out of hospitals a ton.

Ultimately, in high school, we had a huge falling out because his eating disorder was triggering my generalized anxiety, depression, and death anxiety.

But more recently (in the last 2 years) we have begun hanging out again.

I've missed him a ton. Getting him back in my life was a huge gift.

But I've hung out with him dozens of times now since moving back to the area where we both used to live. . . And it's been nearly 2 years and I've never seen him eat anything. Ever.

I've seen him consume water. And I've seen him consume zero sugar variety of Coke. (I never did care for sodas due to how unhealthy they seem, and his exclusive consumption of it has made me almost vomit when smelling it, recently, simply because of how much I loathe the existence of soft drinks.)

He has more than one Therapist, but I have no idea how much he talks about this problem. . . If he talks about it at all with them.

So much of the resources out there are aimed at teens and women. He is in his mid twenties now and is trans, but identifies as male. So these resources really alienate me a bit. Nothing feels built to help this situation.

I am terrified that doing nothing will lose me my best friend to deterioration of physical health. I am terrified that doing something will lose me any time I might have if I just keep my mouth shut.

I don't want to lose my best friend. And I feel like both options end up with the same result, albeit in differing ways and timelines.

When I first started seeing him again. . . I was able to brush my feelings aside. But lately we've been looking forward to certain games together and his poor health has been triggering my death anxiety and causing me to have issues again, just like when we were teens.

I don't know what to do.",1563271856,7/16/2019 5:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cdv3eh/request_how_can_i_help_my_friend/,1

I’ve been seeing a psychologist when I feel I need support. That being said, my biggest struggle is whenever I am faced with a new development in my romantic life. When this happens, I become anxious and seek to restrict food intake to feel better and “in control”. For instance, my first time restricting again after beginning recovery was before a first date. This is purely a “me”-issue, none of my partners or interests have ever given me reason to do this. If made aware, they’ve generally been supportive and try to be as helpful as possible. I have discussed this with my psychologist and she has given me helpful advice and coping techniques, but I am wondering if anyone here has any additional advice or has experienced something similar.

1352,cdv37u,Request: Do I have an eating disorder?,"I f(16) , have never seen a doctor about my mental health. I’ve always been a pretty average weight, healthy, but when I was around 13 I started to see myself as overweight (despite being far from it). Seeing people that were smaller than me in real life made me feel really uncomfortable. I was also very active on tumblr and seeing underweight people on Pro Ana tags encouraged me even more that I wasn’t “normal” looking and that I wanted to look like what those girls looked like. I’d go for a period of time trying to stay away from food, and I wouldn’t eat when I was hungry most of the time. After a couple days I’d either give in and binge, or I’d hang out with friends and would just push the thoughts to the back of my head. 

Over the next couple years I’d off and on struggle with that. I’d go through a period of feeling horrible about myself, wouldn’t want to eat, and then would inevitably binge and would never make any serious weight loss progress. About a month ago I talked to my parents about how it was beginning to effect me, and how I want to talk to my doctor about it before it gets any worse. We haven’t been to the doctor yet, and this past month has been absolutely horrible. 

The voice in my head is so strong, I feel disgusting in my body and the only thing I think about most days is how to push through without eating. I restrict heavily, especially when I’m alone. Being around friends that are eating is the only thing that pushes me to eat anymore, and I almost always cry about it afterwards. Eating makes me feel gross, emotional, angry, and regretful. Im pushing away people I care about and I’m lying to people I love. I’ve been isolating myself from everyone and avoiding summer activities. 

Part of me completely regrets asking for help because it will be harder to try to lose weight and reach my goal. At the same time, i know deep down I need help. I do feel thought that I’m not going to be taken seriously because I haven’t lost a dramatic amount of weight. I’m tired of being this way and I know deep down I deserve help, but are they actually going to think I have an eating disorder?",1563271821,7/16/2019 5:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cdv37u/request_do_i_have_an_eating_disorder/,1
1353,cdv35r,Request: want to better respond to hunger cues,"I’ve always been very underweight for as long as I can remember. My doctor is not concerned (surprising to me) but I have body image concerns at the very least.

I feel hunger normally I think, but a mixture of food availability, pickiness, laziness, anxiety to go to grocery store, or having not enough time in the morning causes me to simply not eat. Like right now I skipped dinner because I’m too lazy to get out of bed and because there’s not really anything i want to eat anyway... but I’m super hungry. 

I can afford food just fine. Its more my maintenance of food availability, finding three meals a day, etc that makes me wonder if I’m depressed? I don’t think i am? Im just lazy if anything. 

I often wonder how others find the time and energy to spend an hour of their day eating, not including prep/cooking time.

My questions i guess are why is it so hard for me to eat and is it really normal to spend one to two hours per day on food/eating? Even if my doctor isn’t worried, is he still the right person to guide me? I feel like this is one of those things that i need to convince myself to just be better at, but i feel thats like telling a depressed person to just be happy.",1563271811,7/16/2019 5:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cdv35r/request_want_to_better_respond_to_hunger_cues/,2
1354,cdhnkq,Request: Losing appetite / getting nauseous when eating in public," In early 2017 (I was a 17 year old male then), I felt like I started to  develop some sort of eating disorder whereby I would completely lose my  appetite when eating in public. In the past, I used to enjoy nice food  in public, used to have no issues eating with friends etc. But since  early 2017, I cant finish a proper meal in public around strangers, I  would feel full after a few mouthful of food. In worse cases, I would  have the urge of throwing up though this only happened once or twice.  Even just having a meal with close friends I would have no appetite too,  and this caused me to somewhat distance away from my friends and even  sometimes rejected when they asked me to hang out because I was scared  of feeling nauseous worrying about the meal. However when i'm at home  eating alone or with my family I have absolutely no issues and can have a  feast with no appetite problems. I suspect this ""disorder"" came about because during this period I was  extremely extremely anxious as I was about to enter military. There was a  lot of uncertainty that I had about the military and I was literally so  worried about everything regarding it, how it would be, how will I be  able manage the toughness, will I have an extremely hard time there etc.  This anxiety made me so sick to the point where I would feel nauseous  almost every day before I went to school, I even remembered on one  occasion I went to school feeling so sick that I had to go to the toilet  to throw up before going to class. Also just to add, during this late  2016/2017 period I was trying to get my own weight up, so was trying  really hard in getting in more calories than my usual intake, so this  didn't help too as you could imagine, trying to force more food in while  feeling nauseous frequently from the anxiety. Fast forward to now, with the anxiety that was caused by the uncertainty  no longer lingering around, I am feeling much better as a person. Never  felt nauseous in a long long time, feeling more motivated as a person.  But 1 problem still persists, I still lose my appetite eating in public,  or rather eating around strangers/friends. This has led me to hang out  with friends very infrequently because I was afraid that when we are  going to have a meal I'm gonna feel all nauseous. This is a hurdle I  desperately need and want to get past as I want to lead a normal life  again, being able to hang out with friends, have fun, have meals with  them happily and with no worries at all, or literally even just have a  meal in a school canteen without any appetite loss or nauseousness. To  put it in another way, I actually think that right now I have no issues  eating in public but then the thought of me feeling nauseous/losing  appetite while eating in the past has caused me to fear that it would  happen everytime I eat in public, therefore the feeling comes back  again. If you get what I mean? 

&amp;#x200B;

Are there anyone out there who experienced something similar or know of  someone who has? Would appreciate if anyone can advice some sort of ways  to help me fully overcome this issue. Would also much prefer not going  to see a psychologists as I have tried it once and it didn't change  anything for me.",1563198331,7/15/2019 8:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cdhnkq/request_losing_appetite_getting_nauseous_when/,2
1355,cdhmt2,Request: How can I help my sister," 

I(22F) live in Japan with my family. My sister(19F) have ED and I need help to help her. I'm trying my best to read as much as possible about ED, but my own depression and anxiety don't let me think straight sometimes. I try to practice the ""I"" statement, but she does't like it when I say that I worry about her.

Sometimes I feel so useless that I just sit there by her side and cry... I can't deal with this anymore. I need a break, but I can't. My mom don't understand her ED and she just put this situation in my hands. My dad is an asshole, a few weeks ago, he came to our room and just yell at her things like: ""You're the one destroying this family"" , ""This is all fake"" and ""You are a dumbass, only stupid people does this to their parents"". This things are in her head now, she even said that that's true and that there's nothing I can say to change this in her mind.

My sister will start treatment for depression this Wednesday. I don't know how things will go. Hopefully she'll get proper help. I don't know.

I keep watching my sister to see if she needs to talk or go out. But I need help with what to say to her after she binges. Or for example when she gain weight (she was devastated this morning). I always fell like I need to do something or at least say something, but I can never find the right words.

1358,cd1dmf,Request: Weight Conscious Athlete?,"I am looking for advice. 

I had a baby 6 months ago, before I was pregnant I was slightly overweight. Since having my little one I have lost a significant amount of weight am currently at a healthy weight, although getting close to underweight. I enjoy being active - rock climbing, weight lifting, and I am training for a half marathon. 

My concern is I spend a lot of time thinking and stressing over losing weight. I still don't feel small or skinny, even though logically I know I have to be since I am close to being underweight. I want to lose a few more pounds and maintain at the lowest end of healthy. I do not desire to be extremely thin. 

I count calories, and weigh everything I eat to the gram. I have a very slow deficit set as my goal, but I have not been getting close to meeting my goal lately as I am eating less and less. It's this horrible cycle because as I eat less, I see faster results with my weight loss so it encourages me to eat even less the next day.  am starting to feel run down and exhausted, which has never happened before. I know I am not eating enough, especially with the amount of exercise I do. Of note, I have an IUD so I never have a period which is normal. 

I am becoming very uncomfortable because every day at work someone is making a comment about me ""withering away,"" asking if my weight loss is intentional, or just saying they are concerned with my weight. I am a quiet person and I don't like attention, so this has been very challenging for me. I am a medical provider, so I know the diagnostic criteria for eating disorders, but I do not neatly fit into any one of them. I'm not sure if I am just a weight conscious athlete who needs to force myself to step away from calorie counting/daily weighing myself/focusing on weight loss, or if I actual do have a problem that needs to be addressed with a counselor. I feel like I could stop if necessary, but I have a strong desire not to.

hey everyone, I’m in a rough spot right now and any words of advice would be very much appreciated. I’ve never posted here before and I’d like to talk a little about my life so here goes

I’m a 20 y/o female and I’ve struggled with disordered eating for about 10 years now. I’m 5’3” and moderately overweight. I wasn’t raised learning how to make healthy, balanced choices.  I was fed bagels, sugary cereal. mac and cheese, and pizza for the majority of my childhood. That’s not an exaggeration. It wasn’t a matter of being picky, that’s just what was easiest for my parents. I’m not trying to push blame but I feel like that’s how everything got started. By the time I learned what types of food and how much of it were appropriate to maintain a healthy lifestyle, I was already addicted to food. 

I’m an impulsive and emotional eater and I can’t help but think about it for an absurd amount of time each day. Nobody in my life understands how much anxiety I get having to walk through the dining hall at college. Or why “what do you want for dinner?” is such a difficult question for me to answer. I want to have a healthy relationship with food. Despite my efforts I’m at an all time low right now and i’m not sure where to turn or how to help myself. I’ve mentioned therapy to my parents and they ignored me (they don’t like acknowledging stressful things) and I’m not even sure if that’s even the path I need/want. 

On top of this, I was diagnosed a type 1 diabetic about 2 years ago, which entails having to know exactly how many carbohydrates I eat at each meal in order to correctly give myself insulin via injection. I can’t eat without having to first consider that, which furthers my disordered habits. 

I’m home for the summer and it’s been very difficult to not overeat, especially having no food in the kitchen and a family who needs help as well. While away at school, I have more urges to under-eat but still usually overeat and this stressful cycle really affects my day to day life. I’ve talked about needing some support and possibly eating healthier with my family but they don’t see this as a big deal, or they’re too anxious about other things to consider how I feel. I know i’m old enough to make decisions on my own but what I need right now is to figure out my next steps because i’m at a loss. 

There’s so much more I could say but I think that’s an alright summary. If anyone relates I’d love to hear from you. Thanks",1562896173,7/11/2019 20:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cc4jwz/request_food_addiction_advice/,5

1374,cbtwt6,Request: ED and Study Abroad,"Hi, everyone. I've been dealing with an eating disorder for a few years, which causes me to have periods where I starve myself and purge everything I eat, but I've been in recovery and have been getting better at combating my ED voice. I'm currently studying abroad over the summer and dealing with the recurrence of ED thoughts and actions. I live in a host house with a cohort of three other people. I don't have control over my meals or really my schedule, which is hard to deal with. Before this trip, I saw a therapist and hung out with a few friends who knew about my disorder. But, on this trip, I've subconsciously let ED thoughts take over, in response to some unintentionally hurtful comments about weight and exercise. I've realized just today that I justify my food intake by the number of calories I burn or steps I take in a day. Today, I purged for the first time in a month in the middle of a run, in response to other students making comments about my (slower) running pace and doing badly at the beginning of the run. The lack of control, my anger about it, and feelings of inadequacy are compiling, and I feel about to spiral. I know it's for such a stupid reason. I'm in a country where malnutrition is a huge issue, so I would feel like a brat for talking to someone about it. I'm also chubbier than the other students, so I feel like people would not take me seriously. If you have any tips to stop a spiral, I'd love to hear it.
TLDR: Recovering from an eating disorder and studying abroad in a host house where my meals are planned for me.

I’ve never had any HUGE problems with body image, let alone my weight but recently I’ve been having problems with eating and it’s only getting worse. About a year ago, I started to count my calories and diet, so I could loose a couple of pounds. Through counting calories I began to eat less and less food throughout the day. When I became busier with work and school, I simply forgot/skipped meals. These incidents became habits and soon I was skipping breakfast and lunch. When I go to try and eat I feel nauseous and gross. The only way I can eat is if I starve myself all day or get super super high. So the problem is now I come home around midnight from a stressful day of working two jobs plus not eating and binge eat everything. I don’t even remember what I’m eating when I’m eating it. I don’t know how to stop the impulses to eat everything in my house and then in the day not eat at all.

i tried eating healthy but that would lead to bingeing, i’ve tried exercising but it made me gain more weight and i don’t have time for it as i have major exams this year , ive also trier intermittent fasting but the moment i eat i would binge like many calories so there’s not much of a difference. the only thing that stops it is when i go on water fasts but i feel like it’s screwing up my metabolism 

i went to the doctor but it’s useless. i really really want this to stop it’s exhausting, the guilt and all, i would literally cry and feel like absolute shit after everytime i binge but i just can’t help it.

1379,ch8492,Request: : water retention and restriction/when to seek medical attention," 

Hello,

I just have a couple of questions regarding AN and hand swelling/water retention.

A bit of some background information: I am a 24-year-old female, diagnosed with anorexia \~3 years ago. I have been in an out of treatment for the past 3 years and it has basically been a constant relapse/treatment cycle. I recently left treatment (3 months ago) and I have lost all of the weight I had gained in treatment and then some; I am now severely underweight - objectively, although it does not feel that I am there is some rational part of my brain screaming ""you are very sick."" I know that I need to go back to the hospital and it is inevitable that I will; however, I am not yet ready (I am working on this). I do not B/P or take any sort of dietetics/laxatives/etc... I do not work out aside from a 20-ish minute walk to and from work and my job is not strenuous. I have read that hand swelling can be caused by an increase in calories (which is not the case), as well as laxative/diuretic withdrawal (which is also not the case).

In the meantime, my main concern right now is water retention and what my body is trying to tell me (other than the obvious ""have a fuckin' calorie"" stuff). I have never had this before and it has become concerning insofar as my fingers are numb and my feet are as well. They are so swollen and I don't know if it is just a salt/dehydration thing or if it is a more serious situation that needs immediate medical attention. They have been swollen for about a week now, but today they have gotten much worse and I am feeling very weak; I am having a hard time moving around and lifting things like my phone, my muscles kind of burn/just give out? If that makes sense.

I hope this has not been triggering for anyone and I apologize if it has come across that way.

TLDR; my hands are swollen and numb and I have been restricting. Is this a serious concern or just a water retention/annoyance type of thing. I do not B/P or take any sort of dietetics/laxatives/etc...

Thank you!",1563974495,7/24/2019 8:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ch8492/request_water_retention_and_restrictionwhen_to/,4
1380,ch83en,Request: Do you think this counts as an eating disorder?," 

So here's the thing. I can't win. If I eat normally, I'm drowning in guilt for eating normally and not doing what I can to cause harm to myself. If I restrict or ""starve"" myself, I'm mad at myself for being a messed up person. Also before I get too far into this post, I should add that I'm a type 1 diabetic.

I've hated myself and my body for years. I've always wished I were brave enough to move from thinking about doing something about my weight and how much I eat to actually doing something. For whatever reason, in the last month or so, I finally got the courage/cowardice to do it. I force myself to wait as long as I can (without dropping my blood sugar really far or until I can't stand the hunger anymore) between meals. It rarely goes beyond 24 hours, but I do what I can. When I do eat, I force myself to eat less than I normally do and try to pick out healthy foods only. I drink tons of water when I'm not eating to help myself not feel quite as hungry so I'll last longer. I lie to my family about when/what/if I ate. I stash snacks in my room so I don't have to eat in front of them. Every time I eat, no matter what or how much I'm eating, I get flooded with guilt, and it usually gets worse after I eat because I generally get food shamed by my family (too much, not healthy enough, food cost them too much money, etc).

Despite the fact that I enjoy the self-torture (yes, I know, yikes), some small part of my brain is going nuts with alarm bells and I forced myself to tell my doctor yesterday. She called it ""starving yourself"" whereas I refer to it as ""skipping meals."" I'm wondering if she thinks I have an eating disorder. Probably. She really wanted to hospitalize me even though I haven't lost a single pound. And for some reason, I'm terrified of being labeled a person with an eating disorder (but probs not terrified enough to stop)

So... at what point does ""starving yourself"" become ""eating disorder""?",1563974365,7/24/2019 8:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ch83en/request_do_you_think_this_counts_as_an_eating/,2

1382,ch81vu,Request: “Not sick enough”,"I (f22) was diagnosed with EDNOS/OSFED in February of this year after a 2 month heavy restriction phase, before that I had been in a binge/purge or binge/restrict phase for about a year and a half but I would say my disordered eating actually started when I was 10 after a traumatic experience. I am seeing an amazing therapist, but she’s focusing more on my trauma than my ED. 
I’ve always managed to maintain a healthy BMI and I’ve never been hospitalised, because of this I, or my ED, manage to tell myself that it’s not that serious and my eating habits are okay because I’m ‘not sick enough’ for any type of inpatient or hospitalisation. 
I’m constantly stuck in a b/p or b/r cycle but because I don’t have any serious health problems and I’m not emaciated I don’t feel like I deserve to get better. 
I’ve managed to convince my family and boyfriend that I’m better, they see me eat whenever they need to and that makes them happy, they think I’m fully recovered! None of them have done any research or taken the time to ask me about triggers or certain ED behaviours that they might miss because I’m a ‘healthy weight’ so it’s not an issue for them.

1383,ch81d7,Request: I am afraid my current relationship is making me relapse,"Hi. 

I've had an eating disorder (have no clue which one... Went from binge eating, to bulimia, to anorexia and so on) for as long as I can remember. About half a year ago I moved out of my parents' house and I recently started working with a bike (I deliver food), so as a result of these things I'm currently just shy of underweight but still have fat on me. I'd say I'd been so worried about not having enough food that my eating disorder simply had no place to be.

Recently though, it's making a comeback. I have a boyfriend, we've been together for a year and a half. He half-lives with me. When I knew him, he was thin but also very muscular. He got chubby since he's been with me (I cook as a way of expressing love), and I've noticed he's insecure about it. I've tried being supportive (without making comments on his weight) by making healthier meals and working out with him. This has triggered old habits back. Plus, he's gotten into the habit of pointing out when I gain a bit of weight, which I've told him I don't like. 

He doesn't know I'm still ill. I told him I used to have an eating disorder, but lied and said I was over it and looking to be healthier now. I believe he thinks he's helping me when he points out I've gained weight (he's not rude about it -- just too matter-of-factly). Really, all he's doing is making me miserable and triggering an awful relapse. I feel awful and can't stand eating again. 

My question is, I've told him before I don't like comments about my weight. I believe I might need to be clearer, to tell him I don't like it because I'm still ill and it sends me back into a relapse. Is this okay? Or is he being unnecessarily cruel? I don't know if it's something I can excuse. How can I tell if it's worth keeping this relationship up? And how do I talk to him about still being ill?

I love him and for the most part, I'm happy with him. But this is destroying my confidence in him and myself. It doesn't happen often at all and he isn't too rude about it, but it still feels dismissive. After telling him I'm ill and asking for support in recovery (I will do this tomorrow), how do I know if it's worth it after that? At what point should I realize he's not respecting this? Should I cut him some slack or am I right in being so upset?

Hi, mostly recovered from an ED ive had since i was young. 

Still very under weight (there is a genetic component to my weight. Given my family I'm unlikely to gain much weight any time soon. we're all very tall and very underweight.)

Every so often I go through phases where I just can't eat. I feel fine with the way I look now and I look forward to gaining a bit more if I can but some days I just cant eat. I've eaten almost nothing lately and I'm worried I'm going to lose weight/get sick. (i've skipped 2 meals today and ate 2 bites of my lunch)

I told myself I could treat myself and go out to what ever restaurant I please or buy myself a pizza but just nothing sounds good. 

Ever since my ED got really bad I usually dont have much of an appetite. i eat but I'm just not very hungry ever. still, usually i can force SOMETHING down. I feel like my lack of an appetite stems from some damage i may have done with my ED. is this possible?

1392,cg6m57,Request: Advice for Changing Therapists,"Hi all,
Currently, I see a therapist primarily for my ED, but for anxiety and marriage problems as well.

My therapist is leaving, but is kindly setting me up with a new therapist, for which I am really grateful. However, I have some concerns with this. 

First, I (F) will be seeing a new therapist (also F), and my current therapist is a male.  I feel super insecure about seeing a female therapist and am secretly hoping that her weight will be more than mine (I understand this is ridiculous). Second, I feel like I was making  progress and now I will essentially be “starting over” and will have to explain again what lead me to have this ED. That makes me anxious because it took me months to completely open up to my current therapist and I have a really hard time trusting anyone, plus reliving what I’ve lived through was not fun. 

Should I give this new therapist a shot or should I say, “Never mind, I’ll do it myself?”  This new therapist will basically be my only option around the town that I live in. 

Thank you for any advice, I truly appreciate it.",1563757434,7/21/2019 20:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cg6m57/request_advice_for_changing_therapists/,1
1393,cg6m2r,Request: commenting on my food at a party,"I'm a former anorexic who has also had issues with bulimia. Today I was feeling major swallowed up by my social anxiety...but I had to go to a friend's party. It was packed. The food line was crazy long and I was so stressed out about having to get in line and have everyone see me. I didn't know many people, so I felt especially nervous. In the past I would have just not ate.

   I am trying to do opposite actions. So I got in line. I got salad with fatty regular Italian dressing and a piece of lasagna. Was still afraid to eat in front of everyone...I ended up eating back in the kitchen by myself. A couple friends ended up joining me and it eased my anxiety some- had some laughs etc, etc.

   A couple minutes later I went back and got dessert. A small brownie and tiny piece of cake. Was feeling really proud of myself...and as I'm headed back to the kitchen a man stops me and says, ""you know that all turns to fat,  right?"" I said nothing and just looked at him...THEN a woman stops me and says, ""Hey, I saw those up there...I wonder if they're worth the calories"" I said, ""I don't know....I don't count calories"". Regardless, I ate the food. And I can't get their comments out of my head hours later. 

   I feel like I've been punched in the stomach and I don't know why. I find this kind of stuff especially detrimental to me and it makes me honestly hate people. I came home and ate too much food and I hate myself more. I just want to isolate and not go to parties ever. I literally forced myself to go to this one. How do you deal with this stuff?

I really want to live a healthy life - eat intuitively, exercise a few times a week for the physical and mental benefits, etc. The problem is that i can't seem to exercise or be mindful of what I eat without spiraling. 
I can't seem to break the cycle of all-or-nothing behaviors and it's really taking a toll on my self-esteem. 
Half the time, I don't watch what I eat. I crave something - so I eat it. Which should be fine, but I get to the point where it's borderline binge-eating. 
The other half of the time, ED mind takes over full-force and I start restricting. If I go to the gym, I overwork myself and leave starving, dizzy, and in pain. 
I wish I had someone to work out with, because I know if I had someone there for accountability I would do better, but I have no one to go with and I am too scared to reach out to people I'm not close to.

I have asked if there is anything I can do to be supportive and she says It’s not my responsibility and she has it under control, which I accept.

I have dealt with ED since I was a teenager (I’m in my early 30s now), with a horrible bout of anorexia from 2009-2011. Last summer I briefly experimented with bulimia but stopped because I snapped out of it (not sure how). 

Since my dad died....I have zero desire to eat. It’s like 2009 for me all over again. The past two days have been worse. I haven’t had anything to eat. And I really don’t know when I’ll want to eat again. 

I haven’t been very good at dealing with my grief and depression in the past, hence the ED..but this time I feel more scared like something in my brain snapped and I don’t ever want to eat again. Maybe I’m punishing myself for the guilt I feel over my father’s death. All I know is not eating gives me some feeling of control when I feel like I’m spiraling. Ugh. 

I’m not sure how to ask for help. In the past I tried  getting help from doctors and therapists with a little success but I did feel a lot of judgement, especially from my doctor.

I don’t live with them and I haven’t told them about it but recently I have been back home for a few weeks due to uncertain circumstances with my job and living situation. 

Being back home has been challenging because there is always someone there watching, meaning I have to be careful about what I eat and when etc as I don’t want them to find out. I stopped purging a few weeks ago but I still have issues with binging and overeating. It hasn’t happened much but on a few occasions I have binged in the middle of the night when I thought everyone was sleeping. My younger sisters bedroom is directly next to the kitchen so she has apparently heard me in there rummaging etc. Then I heard my mum talking to my brother and sister this morning about how all I do is eat and that all the food she buys is disappearing. She said she can’t afford for me to stay here eating her food so I either have to leave, buy my own food or give her money towards groceries. I think that’s fair but I just feel so humiliated that it’s gotten to the stage where my family are talking about it behind my back.

I've never had the best body image and thought that maybe dieting and cutting back portions would help me change my weight and make me feel better about myself. 

My family had gone through a huge change and this along with other events kinda caused me to nosedive deeper into depression. I started to worry more about what I was eating and whether or not it had carbs, sugar or too many calories. I feared eating my favorite foods and dreaded going out with friends because I knew they would wonder why I didn't want to eat. I started to isolate myself despite usually being known as quite outgoing. 

My mother and I live together and I knew she would need help from the change. I love her, but I feel like I can't tell her my feelings cause she'll downplay it and tell me to ""just change how you think"".  At my breaking point I asked if I could go counselor and she told me that she didn't think it was a good idea. 

I'm not doing okay, I feel like a walking corpse and more alone than ever but I'm terrified of talking to people.  I thought i had this whole thing under control and now it feels like it's controlling me. Eveything feels so bland and everything is such a blur. I feel like a failure for falling into this.

1405,ckhikz,Request: Relapsing at Work,"I just graduated college, started a new full time role, and am experiencing a relapse with bingeing/some purging and restricting.

Work has been difficult to navigate because of the abundance of free food (rarely healthy), sitting all day when I used to walk a lot around campus, and a long stressful commute. I feel like I’m losing the fight everyday. 

I’m terrified of gaining weight again, and fear that it’s inevitable. I tried tracking calories to calm that fear but I’ve stopped because I think it’s just damaged my mental health more.

I feel so ashamed whenever I “go rogue” at the office - each day I try to tell myself to eat healthy, well rounded meals, but it eventually deteriorated and by the time I get home the binge occurs. It’s hurting my productiveness, my body image, and my emotional health. I just want to go home and escape. I hate eating at work because the moment I start I feel I have no control. 

Does anyone have experience with this? What are ways I can try to fight this? Also, if I start seeing a therapist on my work health insurance, will that show up in HR for some reason? (Unsure if this is silly lol)

I went  from being very sick with anorexia to the point of being on the verge of death (not a good time) to being very careless about what I eat, which honestly feels weird sometimes. I never confessed to myself that I felt recovered because somewhere in the back of my mind I still have that nagging voice. It’s been a good 2 years since my last relapse but I find my tendencies haven’t completely gone away. 

I still have a very hard time eating meals in front of people, like I just can’t 😣 I don’t know what it is I think is gunna happen if I do but it’s weird. I also have a thing where I just won’t eat all day until it’s super late like 12am and I’ll finally eat but it’s usually a pretty heavy meal. I don’t know if I would consider it binge eating? I’m really not sure.  I feel like I never learned how to eat properly to begin with and I’m still haunted by things people have said to me about weight, and eating. I’m easily triggered by the smallest things people say to me in regards to food. I will get moody or angry at people for something that may have been just an innocent comment. 

I keep panicking all the time that people might know how weird I am around food. I feel like a vampire trying to come into the daylight honestly. I still haven’t even figured out proper portion sizes, there’s still times where I get restrictive, or feel the need to over eat. There’s literally no balance with my ed right now and I’m scared that I’m heading into this all or nothing attitude again. This is one of the worst addictions and I can’t seem to knock it off. I don’t even think anyone would believe this whirl wind of a struggle I’ve been going through because my weight has stayed pretty maintained so I don’t look as sick as I used to. (Which honestly is something I never want again) but I just want to regain a normal relationship with food and stop acting so weird all the time ya know?

My girlfriend of 2 years has struggled with an eating disorder for several years now. She has been attending a lot of therapy (one on one and group) and does a lot of research about eating disorders and etc. She's been slowly allowing herself to gain more weight and trying to reach her setpoint.

She's been doing really well with breaking down bad eating habits and also negative thinking traps. However there is still one glaring issue that she can't get over and I'm not sure how to help. She knows her setpoint from before she lost a lot of weight and is certain that she will reach that setpoint again or even higher than it. She says that she used to be ""fat"" and knows that she will again be ""fat"" and there's nothing she can do about it because ""set points never go down"". She's a biomed major and is incredibly thorough with her scientific research in this area.

She also believes that there is a prominent anti-fat stigma in the world and that people who are overweight are treated worse than thin people. Her therapist says this isn't true and that her weight won't affect how others treat her but my girlfriend doesn't believe her. To be fair I've read some of the studies and just based on how people are portrayed in movies, magazines, porn, etc. it's not wrong that there is a fat-stigma. I don't think it's Pro-ED to suggest this, much like it isn't racist to suggest that black people are less privileged than white people.

So my girlfriend is trying to recover with the knowledge that she will be overweight when she's fully recovered, and is aware of the unfortunate truth that our culture is not especially kind to fat people. She thinks that she's leading herself into hell, basically. And I don't know what to say to her. I've tried to just listen to her, or to suggest that people won't treat her differently, but to no avail.

Hi, I'm a 21 f that doesnt know how to eat. Sooo I guess it all started 3 years ago. I would restrict my calorie intake heavily and exercise vigorously and lost weight rapidly and i enjoy looking smaller.but It would make extremely hungry 24/7 and tired, feeling dizzy and I would faint couple of times.extreme headaches.i was doing this for 6 months. And when I stop restricting. I got INTENSE hunger to eat a lot and wanted to eat everything mindlessly and so even when I saw a brownie , I'll just eat it without even think twice about it and once i did eat cookies out of the trash during a binge. I would try to control my binges sometimes I could, some were successful. I would I always try to compensate for the binges by overexercising and restricting. Then out of nowhere I started chewing and spitting food instead of binge eating because I was like ""why freaking swallow when I could I just spit out the unwanted calories and not gain any weight"" My mom found out of me doing this by seeing me c/s on cookies in the trash and she got really mad at me and said this is bulimic behavior Then it became back or forth thing I either binge and restrict/overexercise or c/s. Now I am currently just c/s becaus I dont feel like to restrict or overexercise/fast for overeating. I always have so many triggers btw. :,) Does anyone relate to these?

So I have been anorexic and bulimic since I was 6 years old, I’m now 28. Four years ago I went to treatment after 6 months I was good I no longer had the urges, But I still hated my body and after 5 months I had gained a lot of weight. I’ve always had an extremely hard time losing weight and keeping it off thanks to having Hashimoto’s disease and PCOS, so I started to feel the urges again and contacted my treatment counselor she was able to talk me away from the urges. After that I spent a year busting my ass and I lost my extra weight. I was happy and healthy or so I thought. I started to constantly get dizzy spells and horrible waves of nausea, no matter what I did nothing helped, it got to a point where I could eat two bites of my favorite food and end up throwing up or a could stuff myself silly and be fine, it didn’t matter what the food was if it was something I’d had a 1000 times or something I never had, my body would just randomly get sick. It’s never just one thing though it randomly happens when I eat, if I end up not being able to swallow and gag I’ll throw up, it even happens sometimes when I take my pills. it’s become so bad that I’m scared to even eat or drink because I’m tired of throwing up, I pretty much live off Zofran and that hardly works. I don’t know what to do anymore my blood sugar (I’m not diabetic) is constantly crashing because I’m scared to eat or drink,  it’s been so bad that at times I have actually passed out and hit my head because my blood sugar crashed so badly. I have talked to my doctor time and time again but he just says there is nothing wrong and there is no reason I should be going through this, all he tells me is to take the Zofran and try to eat. I don’t know what to do anymore, I never had these issues when I was anorexic and bulimic, so I don’t understand why now I’m going through it. I’m at my wits’ end I’m so tired and I’ve already started to starve myself again without meaning to.

1420,cioxp7,Request: Does anyone else enjoy actually enjoy cooking?,"Request: Does anyone else actually enjoy cooking?

Hello. I have been struggling with anorexia and bulimia for seven years now, and I have found that one of the things that helps me abtain nutrition and sustenance is actually cooking for myself and family. Directly after treatment a couple years back I was onky encouraged to use things like cereals, bars, takeout, just things that were mostly prepared. Rarely was I ever making a meal from scratch. 
I actually really enjoy cooking and my family loves the food I eat. It is one of the only thing I can approach in a less disordered fashion (basically, I know that if I want my family to eat it, I have to make real food and not some weird ED concoction), so it encourages me to eat foods I'd normally be afraid of and taste things as I go. Eating out is still really tough atm. 

Do any of you guys like to cook? Do you eat with family/friends? What kinds of things do you find yourself preparing (if thats allowed to say)? I'm very curious if anyone else has the same interest because for me, cooking is one of the few things that doesn't produce extreme anxiety and I always feel proud when I've made something well. The fact that i enjoy cooking so much always surprises treatment providers, as they say that most prefer not to do so.

This has been happening for a few years. In the past if I completely messed up on my diet, I would make myself throw up, but this would only happen like once every few months when I felt sick or felt uncomfortable. 

At the beginning of this summer I wanted to lose weight before school started. So I started dieting an exercising and at first I would maybe throw up once every week or two. In my mind, it doesn’t seem far that I throw away weeks of hard work for one Cheat day. But the last two weeks, it’s gotten to about two or three days a week, and I use it more of an excuse to eat bad on the weekends Bc I know I won’t really eat it. 

I don’t really know. I definitely could stop doing it at any point, because I don’t do it all the time. but I feel extremely guilty and ashamed about eating the food that I don’t throw up.  

I have an addictive personality, but I don’t think I’m able to confuse myself into thinking I don’t have a problem. I know it’s not good I do this, I just think it’s helps me keep on track sometimes.

1429,ci0xon,Request: Why am I like this 😫,"I’m not sure what’s going on with myself, and I’m hoping to gain insight here. 

Backstory: I’ve been overweight/obese all my life. I’m 24, and finally decided to go to my doctor for help losing weight this past December. She prescribed my phentermine and I’ve been on it since, while taking some breaks here and there. I’ve lost a lot of weight and would like to lose more to reach my target. 

Now I’m scared I’ve gotten myself into an unhealthy cycle of binging and fasting. When I binge, it’s literally anything I can get my hands on. The amount of food I consume during my binged have decreased, however it still feels like the same uncontrollable feeling. Immediately after I get an urge to make up for it. So I fast for however long I can last until my next binge. My fasting days consist of a crap ton of caffeine and protein shakes, typically two a day mixed with espresso. When I’m not eating solid food, I’m able to see my weight loss. I feel skinny, and I get obsessed with that feeling because I’ve never been able to achieve it any other way. Any kind of compliment I receive on my weight loss or how I look just adds fuel to my desire to not eat. I start to fear food. I get uncomfortable around it, and I struggle so much while preparing food for my family. I’m scared that taking even a single bite of something will result in a binge. The minute I eat any kind of solid food in any amount, that feeling goes away completely and my reflection goes back in time six months to the body I had before. I feel fat again. I feel disgusted with myself again. And I binge again. This cycle has been repeating itself for months. My last binge escalated to the point of taking a laxative immediately after to attempt to lessen the damage I had done. Part of me is worried that I’ve developed an eating disorder of some sort, and part of me argues that I’m just a fatass and even if I have, it’s not like it could hurt anything. Part of me wants to seek out a therapist to talk to, and part of me is terrified that if I do that I’ll have to stop taking the phentermine and I’ll undo all of my progress and gain it all back. I’ve tried so hard to wrap my head around all of this myself, because I’m scared to tell anyone, but I just can’t comprehend it all. How do I begin to figure out what this is, besides going to a therapist? Every time I’ve wanted to talk to someone about it, I convince myself that I’m just being over dramatic and that it will come off as attention seeking. But it’s only escalating and it seems like it’s starting to affect everything I think and do. My entire days are spent with obsessive thoughts about either how badly I want to binge, or fighting off hunger and convincing myself every minute of the day to not give in and eat. I’m so exhausted mentally.",1564135229,7/26/2019 5:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ci0xon/request_why_am_i_like_this/,5
1430,ci0xmn,Request: Afraid I gave boyfriends my tendencies.,"This is two parts. I apologize for even having the write this as I feel terrible. 

I have struggled on and off for close to 8 years with my eating tendencies. I have highs and lows. Right now I’m on the way back down, as in my low. I have been in recovery on and off for those 8 years. I was doing so well but it is all becoming too much. 

My boyfriend, he is lovely. We have been together for almost 3 years. Now I hid it from him for a very long time but my last relapse was the worst it ever was. He helped me through it. He was patient, he was supportive, anything I could ask for and truly it helped me be okay with helping myself and become okay with a few pounds. Now I am not the heaviest I have been but I am still struggling. I have hid it from him, however he knows I am extremely uncomfortable with my body as I am very open about those sort of things especially when it comes to going to the beach or even something as small as getting changed with him in the room, this might be tmi but i have avoided sex and all types of it for a little bit now so I think he knows something is up with me. Like I said, he is patient and supportive. 

I also said I haven’t told him I’m on my way downhill. I have been trying to just keep a grip on it not wanting to worry him or anyone else. Unfortunately he has stopped eating unless I am with him. I don’t have the time to be with him 24/7 due to family activities, work, and just trying to spread my time evenly between taking care of myself, him, and my family. He says he isn’t hungry, he says he doesn’t feel good. He comments on his weight a lot, forgets to eat. He does a lot of the things I used to do. Such as not eating unless he was around to remind me (as I used the excuse I “forgot” a lot). I used to count calories consistently and I think that maybe rubbed off on him. I comment on my weight a lot whether I was having a high or low. 

I am afraid that maybe I gave him the tools he needed to not eat, in a completely unhealthy way (I’m not sure if this is the correct wording). I am afraid he is using everything I did and like my title says, I’m afraid I gave him my tendencies. I couldn’t think of a different title, and I just feel worse about myself then before because of this. We are open with one another and I ask him if he ate that day, as I always have and as of late he tells me no. He will eat something like ramen and call it a day and I’m very worried. 

The other night he said something that makes me worry even more. He said he “finally understands it” and I just am looking for advice mostly. Please no one make me feel worse about this, I want him to be open with me. I want him to be okay, but I don’t know if I will be okay with myself if I did this to him. 

I am so sorry for having to even ask for advice, I apologize for the length. I am sorry if the word choices are incorrect or come off in the wrong way. I am just a 22f trying to help my 21m before it turns into something more",1564135219,7/26/2019 5:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ci0xmn/request_afraid_i_gave_boyfriends_my_tendencies/,0

1432,chwu4k,Request: Therapy Triggering Relapse?," 

Hello! I just started therapy with a new therapist (I’ve only been to 2 sessions so far), and I honestly did not expect to focus too much on my issues with food/body image. However, due to family history, she asked a few specific, probing questions about my relationship to food and body image, and I felt compelled to answer honestly (trying to get my shit together and be a well-adjusted adult, here). Those answers had her saying “eating disorder” already, and she had me write out a detailed history of my relationship to food and my body/body image for homework.

It was difficult to write, but I got through it - I guess I’ve always *known* I had an eating disorder, so it wasn’t necessarily hard to admit those things to myself. The reading it out loud in the next session, though... oh boy. Because I’ve never been underweight, I’ve been able to make it till now without ever having to talk about that stuff. No one’s really ever taken too much notice and asked. So we kicked things off with a nice little tearful anxiety attack. After that, due to my therapist checking in with my anxiety and asking clarifying questions and reassuring me, etc., I was only able to get through about 1/4 of the written history. Even still, my therapist was using the terms “eating disorder” and “severe body dysmorphia” by the end of the session. There’s many more daunting sessions ahead of me working through the rest of the history, and then tackling out the ED and dysmorphia themselves. (Luckily, she specializes in EDs as well as the other things I actually came to therapy for initially.)

Since starting therapy, and since that last session in particular, I have been feeling so raw, so sad, and so emotionally... beat-up. Like I’ve been hit by a truck. It’s not great. Actually hearing from a professional that this is a serious issue is a lot to process, even if I guess I always knew it was. I’ve been devolving more and more into disordered eating since we started to address this - “forgetting” to eat, scheduling my days so packed that I can say I just don’t have time to eat, “enjoying” my hunger, not having an appetite, and feeling the urge to purge when I do finally eat to a normal/“comfortable” level of fullness (although I am trying really, really hard not to go back down that road). I know if I were to analyze this, it’s my ED digging its nails and desperately trying keep control as my therapist and I prepare to metaphorically yank it out &amp; get my own control back. I also think it’s possible simply thinking about/writing about/talking about my past (more trapped by the ED) self is triggering my current self. But I *have* to talk about triggering things in order to heal!

Has anyone else experienced this with therapy? How can I stay safe while actively working to get healthy with my therapist? It’s all so new to actually talk about this that as fearful as I am digging up the past with her, I’m a million times more afraid of talking about the present. I don’t think I’ll be able to tell her how triggered and “bad” I’m feeling just yet. I’m afraid my ED is going to fully take over throughout this process and prevent me from healing... and I’m afraid of the part of me that wants that more than I want to heal.",1564106620,7/25/2019 21:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/chwu4k/request_therapy_triggering_relapse/,2
1433,chwt8q,Request: Do I have an eating disorder? I'm not sure what is wrong with me," 

I'd appreciate any advice or input anyone could offer. I just want to put on weight and have people stop commenting about my size all the time. I want to have an appetite throughout the day.g my bones or that I should eat more did not bother me one bit. But at the moment I feel so insecure about myself and so embarrassed whenever anyone mentions my weight. Even if it's a compliment.

I do not avoid eating. And I do not think I'm fat. I get very upset about how skinny I am sometimes and I really wish I could just put on some weight. I have a very small appetite and just dont have breakfast in the mornings as I'm just simply not hungry until later on. Throughout the day if I feel hungry I will eat nothing but unhealthy snacks. Chocolate, Crisps, you name it. I find it very very hard to decide on something to eat, so I guess I opt for snacks as its just easier to reach into the cupboard and get something sweet. Sometimes when I'm hungry I just dont eat because I find it so hard to decide what food to make myself and there aren't any snacks in the house.

I usually get hungry for a meal around dinner time. With it being the only proper meal I eat most days. Its worth mentioning that I'm vegetarian, and a fussy one at that, so I eat pasta with vegetables nearly every single night for my dinner.

1434,chthyg,Request: Supporting partner who may have ED tendencies,"I’m in a new relationship and my boyfriend has struggled with weight and continues to struggle with body image. Although I don’t know specially if he has struggled with an ED, some of his current issues seem related. I want advice on how to best support him. 

For background, he was a healthy weight in high school when he was living an active lifestyle. When he got to college he rapidly became overweight. After struggling with that, he became passionate about fitness and lost a bunch of weight and got super in shape and back to a healthy weight. He recently graduated and is now a personal trainer. 

When we’re together he seems to have normal eating patterns so I’m not super concerned about him currently having an ED (although I’m unsure about his relationship with food in the past although overeating seems like it was an issue before), but despite being super in shape and being healthy now, he has opened up to me about how he still views himself as being fat. I’m not sure if he has body dysmorphia or how severe these thoughts go. He knows that he’s healthy and in shape now but he weighs himself maybe once a week and tells me about how he wants to lose a few pounds. Being in shape and being healthy is literally part of his career now so I understand that to some extent it is important but it makes me really sad to know he still sees himself as the overweight guy he used to be. 

When he is negative about himself I normally try and tell him how attractive I think he is because I don’t know what else to say. I don’t want to be dismissive of his feelings but I just want to be able to support him so maybe one day he’ll be able to love his body and not see a distortion of it. 

What am I supposed to say in these types of situations? How can I make sure that he’s doing okay? I don’t really know what advice I need but I more so need input on how I can be supportive of him and how I can make sure I don’t say anything that could make it worse. Is it good for me to give him genuine complements on his body?",1564088536,7/25/2019 16:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/chthyg/request_supporting_partner_who_may_have_ed/,4

I've struggled with restrictive eating much of my life. I'm in recovery and it's been about 3 years since I last had a relapse. 

My partner is just slightly overweight. He had been talking for a while about wanting to lose some weight and get healthier. I have been open about my history with ED, and I've tried to encourage him while also teaching about disordered eating habits. 

Recently and quite suddenly he decided to start his diet, and I've been more triggered than expected. We live together, and watching him diet is dredging up all my old feelings. Do you guys have any tips for being supportive while also maintaining my own mental health? I feel very stressed, and like I have to be on high alert for not only my own warning signs but also possibly his. And even though I am still a little underweight, I feel immense guilt for not dieting and exercising when he does.

My mom has commented on me not eating which is ironic bc she was the one pestering me when I ate too much.

She responded something like “ it’s okay just meal prep!” I don’t even feel like my therapist gets what I’m going through. I basically have an undiagnosed eating disorder and although I know she’s trying to help, it’s almost as if she’s shaming me for being scared of food. I was proud to tell her I ate a cupcake at my brothers bday party and thought she’d be proud. She sorta looked at me like I had 2 heads and was like “...and?!” And then proceeded to ask me if I had guilty feelings that came after and focused more on them than me actually guiding the courage to eat the damn thing. I know every person in these scenarios mean well, and no matter who I talk to nobody is going to feed me (ha, punny) an answer that magically makes me feel better and cures me.

I've had an ed for 5 years. But 5 months ago I decided to recover because I was tired of my life being dictated by this illness. It's been challenging but I'm proud of myself and how far I've come so far. 

I had been on ed twt, but I've never told my family or friends I have an ed, so no one even knows I'm recovering. I've gained weight (obviously) and I've been okay with that cause one of my main goals is to learn to love my body the way it is.

I've rarely gotten triggered by anything, but today my mom pointed out a part of my body I'm still insecure about and asked if I gained weight. I felt so embarrassed that I changed clothes, and ever since then I've had pro-ana thoughts which scared me. I want to feel comfortable eating breakfast today, but after this I just feel terrible. I'm also a person who finds it hard to express emotion or talk about hardships I may be dealing with, especially out loud. I want to tell her so that something like this doesn't happen again, but I'd feel so uncomfortable talking about my struggles at the same time.

1440,cn7mg0,Request: I am lost and I really need someone to listen to me.,"Ever since I was 12 years old, i will never forget this doctor who told me I was getting overweight. I dont know why but maybe because that time i was in a toxic place in school and really insecure. So with that, i started losing weight since my parents support me on that and I pretty much became skinny until I was 15 years old. That time i was so afraid of eating, that I even convince myself to eat tomato as a snack. I workout day and night everyday... I even joined volleyball for the sake of losing weight and even after training, I workout and skipped dinner. During those years I love getting compliments which stucked to me that being skinny is beautiful (ugh). And i am so addicted that everytime I eat something, I will workout.

And then senior high school came in. Im living in a dorm with my best friends. Honestly, some of them really have fast metabolism which makes me envy them because they pretty much eat everything and dont get weight. Im pretty cool with that until it had an influence to me to eat whenever I want. I lost my food restriction and formed a habit of binge eating. I still have that i-eat-food-and-workout-later habit but sometimes I cant do that because I am so busy in school and im afraid anyone will tell that something is wrong with my relation with food. I gained weight. My bmi says im normal but my brain doesnt. I still think I have to be pretty skinny. Some of my best friends are losing weight and theyre proud of it. It's making me insecure knowing that I also want to lose weight but I cant because i already lost my restriction in eating and im allowing to feel my cravings which i cant control. I have already developed stress eating which I always regret and sometimes I silently make myself puke in midnight so that my dormmates wouldnt be awake because of me. 

I am incoming freshman college and I will be staying in my new dorm which is very far from my home and old friends. I am anxious in my first year since i'll be taking engineering course. This makes me worry that I will repeat the same cycle and I dont know where to tell this, Im even afraid to tell this to my parents because they will only say that it is okay to eat but it's like saying it's okay to breathe.

1441,cn7lwz,Request: Why can’t I eat?,"Hello. I hope this belongs here. 

I have trouble with eating regularly. I’m overweight and diabetic but I treat my body like garbage. 

At age 8, I gained a lot of weight due to a medical condition. I was treated with oral steroids for a very long period of time, going from normal to obese in the span of two years. I became restrictive at age 12 after a trauma and often skipped breakfast and lunch and came home in the afternoons after school to binge in private. 

This pattern continued until I switched to binging once a day or eating large quantities of food during my shifts at work at 19. It was disgusting but I couldn’t stop myself. 

Now, I’m diabetic at 26 from steroid use, genetics, and my weight. I was diagnosed at 19 and it was devastating. But I was in denial at first until my feet went numb. From there I took my condition seriously and treated myself  for a few years but the last 2 years have been a hellscape. I was diagnosed with both Grave’s disease and endometriosis in a six month span in 2018. 

I have a lot of health issues that I’m treating like depression, Graves’ disease, endometriosis, and diabetes. It’s been a very hard few years. 

I don’t eat regularly. I often eat one meal a day and it’s often not prepared by me or is take-out just to quickly get those calories and have emotional and physical satiety. 

Snacking, cooking at home, just generally enjoying food is feels impossible for me. I just cannot bring myself to eat regularly and it’s affecting everything. 

Can someone help me understand why I may do this? I don’t understand myself or my motives and this seems atypical to things I’ve read. It feels different than my previous history with ED. 

I’m not trying to lose weight. I buy food and then let it rot in my fridge and counter. I’m miserable and lost and I just don’t know where this all went wrong.",1565193450,8/7/2019 10:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cn7lwz/request_why_cant_i_eat/,2

But because in between binges I tend to restrict moderately to excessively (anywhere from fasting to well under weight loss calorie goals) she said she might be leaning towards bulimia and wants me to speak to someone well versed in all aspects of eating disorders (she specifically does BED).  

She told me that the excessive restriction is a sort of “purge” because is compensatory behavior for the binge. Has anyone heard of that or been told the same?

I’ve spent years reading books on binge eating and I’m thinking of picking up something on bulimia but I would think they would mostly concentrate on the more obvious forms of purging.

I did try to diet but each attempt would often end up failing because there are times where I would have intense cravings for food and I would end up eating large quantities of said food to the point that my stomach would hurt from eating said food. When I eat, I feel like I lose control and zone out. But after I'm done eating, I feel an immense amount of guilt and shame as though I made some sort of mistake. I have to compensate somehow for the mistake I made and I would do this by drinking a lot of milk, since as a lactose intolerant person, milk acts as a laxative. I would also drink a lot of coffee since that's considered a diuretic as well. But it's hard to poop sometimes so lately, I've started doing water fasts and exercising a lot. Only as a last resort I would force myself to vomit since I know that can destroy my teeth. I don't know why I keep making the same mistake of eating too much over and over again!

I see SO much of myself in the posts here... from the when / how to tell my parents?  To the “I don’t think recovery is possible for me”

Let me be the example to show you that recovery IS possible, and life after the ED is amazing!  

I never believed in it.  I thought I was destined to either death or struggling for the rest of my life.  I had no hopes for a happy, fulfilling life.

But at one point, I got sick and tired of being sick.  I decided I was willing to do whatever it took to find some relief.  So, at age 27, I checked myself into an inpatient program for the second time.   I followed the program, even when it seemed stupid to me and I didn’t want to.  I continued with therapy, support groups, and aftercare appointments after I got out, even when I didn’t want to.   I followed the meal plan and ate the amount of food prescribed even when I didn’t want to.   The inpatient program jump started my recovery... Little by little, I got stronger and stronger.  

Then one day years later a close friend asked me if I was still in therapy.  I said “yeah of course!”  She said “I’m not sure why!  You seem completely  ok now... maybe you don’t need it any more?”

I took some time to think about it and realized she was right!  I had arrived.  I was healthy and strong in my recovery and it was time to end my therapy.  

I talked to my theory about stopping the antidepressants.  She had concerns but I promised I’d restart them if I didn’t do well.  I was fine.  A few months later, we stopped therapy.  Again, therapist had concerns, but I promised I’d be back if I relapsed.  But I didn’t.  The therapy and work I did taught me that there were more important things in life than trying to exist on nothing, or binging and purging.   

I always felt like I wasted part of my life (most of my late teens and twenties was consumed by the EDs).  But now I appreciate they made me who I am today.  They are part of my history but no longer ties to my identity.

If you have an ED, please ask for help!  I did it and it was the best decision I ever made.  It was the beginning of my recovery from the chains of my ED!",1565139517,8/6/2019 19:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cmyz9p/request_my_thoughts_on_recovery/,5

I take Wellbutrin. It works wonders for my depression and my mood. I’ve tried SSRI’s and had horrible side effects so I can’t take those (I ended up with serotonin syndrome). I’m not interested in changing my medication. 

That being said, it KILLS my appetite. I mean nothing sounds appealing. I can go a whole day without eating anything and forget that I haven’t eaten. It’s like food just isn’t on my mind. When I remember to eat, I can stomach small snacks like pretzels. Yesterday I ate half a protein bar and couldn’t bring myself to finish it.

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about 10 months now, and found out early on about her ED. Things seemed to be relatively under control for the first few months, but a job change triggered some pretty bad old habits that have continued on for 4 months or so now.

No appetite, refusal of food, purging, desires to purge, poor sleep, chest pains, the full kit and caboodle.

Apart from the obvious therapy/doctor support she needs, I’m wondering if anyone has experience with cannabis for the reduction of anxiety and promotion of appetite? Been looking for each and every way I can be of support emotionally, as well as being and advocate and a resource. I enjoyed plenty of reefer back in the day and am wondering if it’s worth giving it a go? Any anecdotes are appreciated.

1457,cm2pmv,Request: Post Request: I need help for my mom,"My mom (48F) has been putting herself on extremely restrictive diets for years and I'm starting to get concerned (or well, I've always been concerned but it's worse now). 

She eats way below the recommended daily amount of calories per day but insists that it's fine because the supplements that come with the diet ""take care of vitamins and other important stuff"" or whatever. It would be one thing if she did the diet once for a few weeks to lose weight, but she does it multiple times a year, basically the second she gains *any* of the weight back. To put this in perspective, she's a normal, healthy weight for a person her height, and that doesn't change when she gains a pound. But she'll go back on the diet anyway, immediately.

Lately she's been experiencing chest, shoulder, and arm pain. She got her heart checked and the doctor says everything's fine, and I genuinely think the issue is muscular. She has literally no muscle mass on her because she goes on this crazy diet and doesn't exercise at all. Like, she can't even do a push up, even on her knees.  And now she's in a lot of pain to the point that she's considering going on disability because she can barely drive herself to work most days. 

I genuinely don't know what to do. Me and multiple other relatives have told her to get off the diet, but we're not getting through to her. I've mentioned that I think the pain might be muscle related but I don't know if she believes me. I'm going to start going on walks with her this week, and she's going to physical therapy for the pain soon so hopefully they might be able to convince her, but that still doesn't solve the problem of her constantly putting her body through this diet.

I've personally never had any problems with my weight (I'm chubby but I'm pretty strong which is all I care about), so I'm hoping another perspective might help.

1458,clz6ad,Request: wondering whether or not I have an ED," 

Hi, so I don’t really know where to start but here goes. So I’m \[22F\] wondering whether or not I have an ED so I need some advice because I don’t want to bother my GP if it’s unnecessary. So, for years, I’ve had issues with eating. As a kid, I was a little bit chubby and would eat crap. I grew up in a household where most things came out of a packet, a box or something like that and still maintain that diet to this day. I became a vegetarian at age 11 and still am. Recently, I’ve noticed a severe decrease in my appetite. For some background, I have other MH issues such as bipolar which I was on medication for which can increase weight gain so I was really paranoid about putting on weight but have come off that medication in the last few months and in my head, I do not want to eat. To elaborate on that a little bit: I get hungry and my belly rumbles and I think about food but every option available my mind finds a way to make it sounds or look disgusting in my head and I put off eating until I can’t anymore. My weight is of a normal weight for my height but I don’t carry it very well although others would disagree. I’ve always had a negative body image and I spent one year in my teens starving myself on off and dropped about 1/5 of my total body weight and even then I still felt fat. In the past few days, I’ve been waiting until the point until my stomach is basically screaming at me to eat something and then I feel so sick after. Another thing is that I smoke weed and so whenever I do that (which is usually one at night time most nights but not all) I then binge on chocolate and crisps until I feel sick and when I’m sober again, I feel disgusted in myself. I’m at a loss at what to do and I’m unsure on whether it’s due to my other MH issues or there is something deeper but like I said, don’t want to bother doctors if I’m just being stupid. Any advice?",1564940686,8/4/2019 12:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/clz6ad/request_wondering_whether_or_not_i_have_an_ed/,2

Hello, so I am a 20 year old female and for the past seven years I have struggled with anorexia nervosa- recently grazing more in to the ""binge-purge"" subtype/severe bulimia nervosa. My main method of purging is laxatives/diuretics. 

So this year I had hit my all time low, not just weightwise but like, everything. I'd fast for days, than binge/purge, repeat. When I decided to stop taking laxatives I was rushed to the hospital due to refeeding syndrome and SEVERE edema. The kind of edema was extreme, all over my body, to the point where no clothes fit, I couldn't walk, my abdomen was blocked, and at the hospital I was told I had colitis along with 10+ large ulcers in my stomach and esophagus from the laxatives. I stayed for about a week and the swelling went down. I still weigh more than my lowest but I'm still considered severely underweight. I am eating three meals a day, and haven't binged in two weeks. In fact, this morning I started picking at leftovers and stopped myself to regroup and decide what to eat before having lunch. 

So I am eating 3 meals a day (sometimes a small dessert (I used to binge HEAVILY with desserts), but my mom is still worried about my patterns. I have been using laxatives, a lot of them still. I feel like I can eat normally and take them and maintain this weight. Everytime I go to the bathroom, I pop 2 or 3 of them just to make sure I have the opportunity to. Also, I HAVE to go on a walk everyday. Even if I don't feel good, I have to reach my step goal before midnight. 

The other night I was throwing up in pain from the lax and afterwards, still needed to pace to get my last few steps in. I feel like since my weight isn't as low as it was a few months ago, and I'm eating and going to therapy, that I'm in recovery. But I don't know. What are your thoughts on this?",1564940620,8/4/2019 12:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/clz5th/request_post_request_is_this_recovery_or_am_i/,1

I haven’t been like this all my life, I think the past 2 years, could be longer. I feel disgusted, nauseous, wanting to eat food sometimes. It sort of comes and goes. It will happen for a week or two then i’ll be back to eating regularly.

I eat pretty healthy. Whole wheat, veggies, brown rice, etc. I know how to cook really well, so I have a big variety of different meals. Sometimes I make dishes that are slightly unhealthy but still good for me. But after a while I just get sick of food. No matter what I put in, I feel like puking it all out. I feel disgusted taking the first bite sometimes. I try to force myself but I get more nauseous. I tried switching up my meals to add more variety but I still feel sick. Some I can handle and some I can’t. The only way I’ve noticed to sort of fix this is if I eating junk food. Example: Mickey D’s Chicken Nuggets. I was forced to eat junk food in order to get calories in me, because my body was hurting and I kept feeling light headed.

Now it’s back again, I feel sick eating. I just had a cookie that helped, but I still feel sick. Do I have some sort of eating disorder?",1564940464,8/4/2019 12:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/clz4pf/request_do_i_have_a_eating_disorder/,2

The poster from the info in the bulletin was similar to me. I am an 18 year old female who recently has had a lot of mental health struggles. Included in this was an inability to feel hungry for a long period of time, twice. This made me have to force myself to eat foods and it shrunk my stomach right up.

I haven’t been eating correctly since school ended. I no longer had a schedule for my eating. So I would wake up in the middle of the day and only eat dinner, and do nothing for the rest of the day to need the amount of calories for three meals. Then, I got sick a few times in the summer which made me have no appetite again. This makes me worried because I can’t see myself forcing myself to eat for every meal continuing on. And if I do eat, I feel full after two bites.

I purposely skip meals because I am not hungry or feel that I haven’t done enough for more calories than one meal or two even smaller meals. It’s not out of my emotion about myself. I personally think I look better at my BMI being in the middle of the normal range, but mine is getting close to being underweight. No muscle, so it can’t be far off from the truth. I’m not sure how to proceed or if this is even a mental health thing i’m very anxious.

One thing that I noticed has been bugging me a lot more since I’ve been in recovery is the way other people eat. I cannot handle when I perceive others to be over eating, or binge eating. 

My biggest trigger would have to be my boyfriend. He eats so carelessly and whenever he is hungry and basically anything and it triggers the heck out of me because all I can think about are the amounts of food being consumed, the calories, and obsessing over the periods between his meals and if they are “long enough”.

Same goes for my younger sister and sometimes even my coworkers. 

It sometimes becomes so uncomfortable like I am the one engaging in this perceived binge eating. 

I told my therapist about this and she didn’t understand it but also she wasn’t particularly specialized with eating disorders.  I just want to see if anyone else experiences this and if they have advice on how to talk about this/seek help/open up to my boyfriend without upsetting him.

I’ve always been very skinny. I’m 4’10 and 18, and currently I feel quite underweight. My weight apparently “normal” for my height and age, but I can’t stand it, and I feel unhealthy. Two summers ago I weighed an average or maybe even slightly above average weight for my height and it was perfect. I loved my body and I felt confident. However it started going down the drain. I lost more and more weight very quickly. I have really bad anxiety about eating, but NOT because I desire to lose weight. I have a horrible fear of choking. I choked on food when I was younger and ever since then it’s been a problem for me. I’m always afraid it’ll happen again. But even when that fear isn’t on my mind, I still have a very decreased appetite as of late. I never desire food. I have had major depressive disorder for years, but only within the past 1 1/2 maybe have I felt such a decrease in appetite. I eat so little. Now I don’t know for sure, it’s just a hunch, but my hair has also begun to fall out. Is it possible it’s from a lack of food/nutrition? This on top of, lately I’ve been noticing that my clothes that used to be tight on me, are now very loose, I’ve just felt so unhappy with myself. Everyone says “just eat”, but I don’t even have the appetite. I’m so unhappy with myself right now. My parents constantly call me “anorexic”, but I WANT to weigh more and eat more. But I feel zero desire, and when I try to eat without an appetite it just makes me feel sick.

first, here is some background information about my eating habits etc.: I've always been at a healthy weight, but about 1 1/2 years ago, I gained a significant amount. I was still somewhat within the healthy range I'd say, but didn't feel comfortable in my skin anymore, which is why I decided to lose weight. 

That process didn't go about particularly healthy, but that is not my current problem: I am really struggling with binge eating. I don't actually want to lose any more weight, just stay at the point I've reached now, but I just don't seem to be able to eat ""normal"" amounts of food - I start off by eating a healthy portion, but then continue to stuff myself with more and more and more food, promising myself not to freak out about it - which I still do, as expected by now. 

 Then, I am trying to restrict my food intake - not even to a concerning point, just to a managable, sustainable one, and I still fall back into that cycle, sometimes after a week, sometimes the next day - which leads to building up even more fear about significant weight gain. 

I do not particularly fear gaining some weight back on, I just cannot shake the feeling that my binging habits will make me gain weight uncontrollably once I ""losen up"".

Unfortunately, I've reached a point where my mental health is severely suffering from this, as well as my physical health- everyday, I feel like it's just too much to go through that cycle again and again. 

Has anybody else got experience with that kind of  behaviour and has been able to stop it/get significantly better?

Ice cream is one of my bad foods and I usually feel extremely guilty after eating even a very small portion, but I decided to push through my fear and try to have some with my mom tonight. 

We made ice cream and cones and were sitting on the couch trying to find a movie. For context, my mom has a huge heart of gold but is notorious in my family for saying very stupidly insensitive things. Anyway- she has dark brown leather couches that have faded with time. We have one sofa spot that everyone always sits in because it’s right by an outlet, a small coffee table, and lamp, as well from being right across from the tv.

I sit down in what my mom has just decided is “her spot”. She tells me she doesn’t want to sit in “my” spot (the common spot) because I always sit there and I “made a dent in it”. Logically, I get that my mom has some back issues and that this area of the sofa (the common spot) has much more wear and thus less back support than the spot she prefers, but my ed brain took over and I immediately threw (literally, threw) my ice cream away and ran to my room crying. My Ed is telling me that I’m so fat and disgusting that I made a “dent” in the couch- and that has to be true because even my own mother is telling me so.

1478,cq7cta,Request: How can I support my long-distance girlfriend with her severe ED?,"My girlfriend has been struggling with an extremely severe eating disorder for the past few months. She restricts her eating, and barely eats anything. She has also recently told me that she purges 4-6 times per day on average. She is in the process of determining a treatment plan and is seeing two therapists. We are long distance so often she is feeling physically and mentally bad (from restricting/purging) and I feel like we spend a lot of time on facetime just looking at each other with nothing to talk about. When we do talk it seems to be only about serious things and her disorder which is fine, but nothing I say or do seems to reassure her or make her feel any more hopeful and it makes me feel helpless, especially since I am many miles away. We used to smile and laugh on Facetime a lot but recently it has been much more somber as her ED has gotten worse and worse. This causes me anxiety and worry about if I am supporting her well at all or if I am even worth talking to while she is trying to focus on getting better. This is severe and is turning into an all-encompassing thing, so I’m looking for any help I can get.

Why cant i just be healthy?

I am a 21 year old male who is about average height but am very underweight and im getting lighter by the week.

Due to work i often have to skip or miss meals but its not like i feel hungry or crave food during normal eating times (or any times for that matter) but when i do eat i find myself involuntarily throwing up again.

Since high school i have been underweight and it was usually put down to a high metabolism alot concerned my mother alot.

I managed to gain a decent amount of weight (still considered skinny and underweight mind you) by training at the gym for muscle mass but all weight fell off me the second i wasnt able to use a gym for financial reasons.

I find it so hard to put on weight and i feel like im almost giving up on trying, i often cant be bothered to eat just out of frustration knowing id just be thrown up later in the day.

I dont have an issue with body image i don't think. Obviously id rather be bigger but really im concerned about my health.

I don't know what I'm trying to achieve by posting here? Maybe someone knows what's going on? Maybe someone knows a way to help? Maybe this is all a simulation and im going to wake up soon anyway so all the time i wasted writing this sporadic nonesense for too long is to no means?",1565745472,8/13/2019 20:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cq2lht/request_why_cant_i_just_be_healthy/,2

Can someone try to give me advice? I can’t tell if I actually have an eating disorder or not and i’m too nervous to actually go to the doctor about it (i will eventually) I have trouble eating meals.

After eating a meal, I feel really shitty. I still have food cravings, but after every time I eat, I feel really disgusting. I always feel like throwing up after eating (especially if I feel bloated). I’ve also realied that Most of the time I really only eat because whenever I don’t eat for a long time I get super cranky and dizzy. In general, I really don’t like eating unless I have to.

I’ve never binged ate or made myself throw up after eating, so that’s why I’m a little confused as to whether or not I have an eating disorder.

what do yall think? would the doctor say anything other than “keep eating”? All my friends always tell me to eat but I don’t think they understand that I absolutely hate eating.",1565745311,8/13/2019 20:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cq2ki7/request_too_nervous_to_actually_go_to_the_doctor/,4
1481,cq2ha7,Request: am I suffering from an eating disorder? What should I do?," 

Hi! I’m a 13 year old female seeking some answers. I really don’t know what to say so I guess I’ll start off with my bad “habits”???

Ok, so I really only have like a meal and a half a day and usually quite small servings. Little to no snacks as well. I have tiny panic attacks when I am faced with a situation in which I have to eat a lot, like going out to eat or a big holiday meal.

Body image wise I’ve always been quite naturally skinny but within the last couple of months I just feel massive and grotesque. I’ve always been the “skinny friend” but now that’s not enough? I’ve gotten into obsessively weighing and measuring different parts of my body, especially waist and stomach. I’ve gone down a few pounds already, and I’ve noticed some bones beginning to pop out a tiny bit, like my hip bones and collar bones. Recently, I’ve also been a lot more fatigued. And every time I get up I’m dizzy (more than usual I mean, I always am like this). Also, I’ve become more focused on food, like “what’s for dinner” and “when is dinner” or “what’s the meal plans for tomorrow”. Anyways, I think that’s it for body image stuff.

Some other important facts may be that 1) I already have been diagnosed with OCD and have a therapist for that, but I haven’t told her anything about the food worries. 2) I have a friend who became badly Anorexic for about a year. She’s recovering now and doing much better, but still. She was a close friend of mine, so I guess it affected me a decent amount. And that’s it I think for other facts.

Ok, to anybody who read this whole thing, thank you so much. Any sort of answer would be a massive help because I can’t stop thinking about this whole thing. Well, that’s it for now.

1483,cq2gau,Request: Anorexia recovery advice,"I moved in with my fiance recently, and he and I are getting used to living together. We're trying to work out things like shopping/cooking, and meal times. There are multiple stressors in play though; I was recently laid-off and haven't found work yet, and he's just started a night shift position as a nurse.

In response to the stress, my anorexia has ramped up- I've always had food issues, and I've dealt with anorexia with varying levels of intensity for about 8 years now.

The main issue is that when I lived alone, my food was mine and I didn't have to think about accommodating another person, but now there are two of us and all the food is just ""food""- there's no distinctions. However as a nurse, my partner needs there to be leftovers and snacks to take to work, and food he can easily heat up and prepare for when he's exhausted after a shift.

I have twisted these needs into a narrative against myself. I refuse to touch leftovers I didn't cook unless I receive his permission to eat it and in general I eat far less than I need to, because I believe that if I eat too much he's not going to have leftovers or snacks and then I will be inconveniencing/upsetting him.

Being unemployed has of course made everything worse. I get up early and go on five-mile walks, which I'm sure is driving my metabolism through the roof. I spend all day so hungry, and I keep choosing not eating over the guilt eating brings me. The snacks in the house are my nightmare- I never bought snacks when I lived alone because I have no self-control. If I start eating snacks it's going to trigger a binge and then I'm not going to stop eating until I well and truly hate myself.

My fiance is aware that I had an ED in the past and is almost definitely aware I struggle with it still, but I have not told him outright and I have not given him the scope of which it affects me.

Once I say it aloud it's going to be a Real Issue and he's going to want to address it, and then I worry I will feel like everything is a calculated move against me. Cooking calorie-dense meals, eating out, buying snacks, offering me bites of things or the rest of something, leaving food visible-; it's all going to feel like an attempt to undermine me and I'm afraid my response will be to get actively worse instead of better, even if he's not trying to do that. I also probably would not do well with the questions of ""have you eaten today?"" and related questions as I find that condescending.

Does anyone have ideas as to how I should approach him, how the two of us could approach the issues of the food distribution, or other advice?",1565744707,8/13/2019 20:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cq2gau/request_anorexia_recovery_advice/,1

1487,cpb6bu,Request: How can I regain control?,"So, I’m an FTM trans person, and for the past 3 years, I’ve been struggling with restriction and forcing myself to vomit, although I wouldn’t exactly say I have an eating disorder considering it comes in waves and I do still eat everyday. 

It hurts to eat, and every time I am forced to either by my mom or myself, I feel extreme guilt and end up isolating myself in my room because I hate that I was so “weak.” I even will sometimes restrict water because it will make my stomach look bigger.

So, at this point I’ve deduced the reasoning for my restriction and guilt is because of my being trans. I was blessed to have a small chest, but it’s still enough to annoy me. It hurts me to look at and know there’s nothing I can do right now. I also just feel so out of control over other aspects such as my voice, face shape, and... well... one last place I refuse to mention, but you can probably guess. This is pretty obviously where my restriction originated from, as the first time I even started restricting was when my mom refused to get me puberty blockers (I have them now, but it doesn’t erase my chest).

So... I guess my question is, what should I do so I can regain control? I don’t want to not be able to get blockers anymore because I’m too underweight and my electrolytes are shot. And it’s starting to get there, as I am now considered to be in the underweight category (not by much, but I am, and it’s getting slowly worse). I unfortunately can not get Testosterone until I am 18 for moral and psychological reasons (two years). Is there anything else I can do? I don’t want to be anorexic.

plus, last year i went to my anual check up and weighed in marginally less than i do now (i’m trying to avoid numbers lol). i weighapprox 120% what i did at my last check up. this year’s is coming up. and i’m so, so afraid. if they mention my weight gain i will do one of two things: 1) say something along the lines of “yeah, i sure hope i gained weight. i had an eating disorder this time last year and it was very unhealthy. or 2) cry. right then and there.

Good Afternoon!

I’ve (relatively) recently come to realize the difficulties I’ve been having with food. Though I’ve overeaten my entire life—a practice I am actively trying to fix, I’ve come to understand that my issue is predominantly with taste. I’m out of college now and there’s a long, long list of foods that just taste revolting to me to the point that I’d rather skip the meal than eat them. Naturally, that category consists of primarily healthy foods and I’ve come to understand just how heavily it’s impacting my body image/confidence and thus my life. It’s hard enough for me to deal with myself because it leads to god-awful eating habits, but it impacts my relationship with my family because of how difficult any situation with food becomes. Mealtimes become a nightmare because of me, but what can I do when certain foods simply taste inedibly bad? My folks have tried the whole “tough love” thing that parents do when teaching young children that they have to eat things they don’t like. It doesn’t work and only makes me dread every meal.

With this in mind, I’ve been seeing a therapist who specializes in eating disorders and, though they’ve been wonderfully helpful, there doesn’t seem to be any explanation available to why I cannot stand the taste of so many foods.

Interestingly, I get the same reaction (plus a bunch more chronic pain) after running/high impact exercise, so I have already been undergoing testing to check for arthritis or other autoimmune/inflammatory problems but found nothing so far. 

Anyways, if this is a typical symptom of bulimia then I won't worry, but if it only happens to me then maybe purging somehow triggers the same mechanism that makes my joints swell when I run. In that case it could be another hint indicating an underlying illness and I will have to talk to my rheumatologist about it...which is a conversation I really don't want to have :( So, anyone have this happen to them?",1565343818,8/9/2019 4:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/co038r/request_anyone_heard_of_knees_swelling_after/,9

My mother consistently makes comments about my weight. Her comments have gotten into my head so much that I cannot even eat around her without feeling guilty or ashamed. I have to go outside of my house to eat or to literally sneak around the kitchen and get myself something quiet from the pantry so I can eat it in peace in my room. It’s not even peace when I eat it alone because I still hear her comments. I feel so totally disgusted with myself when I eat.

1501,cnnzty,Request: A good piece of advice I got recently,"I'm a 13 year old male recovering from anorexia, and I've recently become inspired to get involved in the community a little. I haven't been on reddit in quite a while but I decided that this is one way I could participate. Anyway:

I was going for a walk with my cousin (24 years old and female) whom I have always been very close with. She is also recovering from anorexia so we chat about it regularly. We were talking about it for a solid 2 hours, and towards the end, she gave me a piece of advice that I've thought about a lot since. She said that when she starts hearing the anorexia thoughts, one of her methods of dealing with them is to make them sound stupid. Like, I don't know, say they're serving cake at a party and you notice the eating disorder thoughts coming. If you take a step back and make them sound dumb, it really puts it into perspective. For instance, you could tell yourself (sarcastically, of course):

Okay, yeah. Let's have a freak out about this one piece of cake, I'm sure that will make for a good evening

I've done the whole thing, the therapy, the nutritionists, the hospitalizations, and I hate to admit it but this is the thing that I think of most in everyday life. It really has helped me.

1502,cnk3ku,Request: Losing weight after eating disorder," 

I have never had a good relationship with my body and eating as a teen, but it wasn't until developed 2017 that I think I developed an eating disorder. It started out as a diet but quickly turned bad. The comments of ""omg you look so good!"" that encouraged me quickly became ""you need to eat.""

I was never formally diagnosed, but did see doctors and counsellors to address my issues with eating. Fasting, restriction, and constant food preoccupation, body checking, weighing myself multiple times a day, etc. was what it was like to live in my brain and life during that time. My grades slipped badly because of it causing me fail and drop a few courses. I had lost a lot of weight very quickly.

I tried to recover about four or five months into it because I was so miserable and scared of dying and did gain a little bit of weight, but still was controlling my weight. I was only underweight for a short period of time. Doing that was very triggering though so I developed purging to deal with it. I dropped back down to borderline underweight before a summer trip.

After that trip, I felt I was done with it. It had been several months since I had last got my period. I did purge a bit in the beginning, but when I went back to school, I hung out with friends a lot and kept up with my studies and wasn't bothered too much. I think I only relapsed once last year of uni.

Now I am at a higher weight that I have been maintaining (just a few pounds from being overweight) and I really hate myself for it. I recently relapsed (purging) a few weeks ago because I just want this weight off.

I have calculated the calories I would need to burn and have elaborately made a plan that will take about 8 months for me to get back to a weight I think is acceptable. I think it is more sustainable than my previous method of losing weight.

One part of me just wants to do it so I can have the aesthetic of being thin again while another part of me wants to do it as I know it could tempt me to become more restrictive and be able to finally prove my sickness. I feel like I never got sick enough because the duration of my eating disorder wasn't long, I was never diagnosed, and I didn't stay underweight long enough. I know that might sound really f-ed up, but that's just the truth.

And then of course there's the addictive coping side of this disorder that helped me ""cope"" a lot during one of the most depressed years of my life. Yeah, my life was miserable, but I had this world of numbers and counting that I could retreat to all hours of the day and bring with me wherever I went. It was comforting. And knowing how stressful this upcoming semester of uni will be, I really feel like I need it again to cope.

At the same time, I am trying to reassure myself that I will love my body in all stages and will not be overly restrictive with my new diet plan. The calorie counting is already a bit triggering, but I know no other way to lose weight. My brain is already becoming preoccupied with the food and numbers, but I really want to lose this weight. All I know is that my mind is set on weight loss and I don't think I will happy with my appearance unless I am at a certain body weight and BMI. Just trying to keep it as real as possible. I feel like even though I was nitpick of my body when I was at a lower weight, at least I knew I was skinny and people did too. I think that made me somewhat happy.

Any advice on losing weight after ""recovery"" or dealing with being at a higher weight? Sorry if this is not allowed here. Will find another platform to post it if t's not.",1565261825,8/8/2019 5:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cnk3ku/request_losing_weight_after_eating_disorder/,1
1503,cnk2ek,Request: Mother buys my trigger foods. Is it OK if I throw them out?," 

So let me give a short background. I've struggled with an ED since I was about 13, so a decade now. My psychiatrist has categorized it as EDNOS, because I have episodes of anorexic like behaviors and then bulimic like behaviors.

I've lived with my parents throughout this. They don't know all the nitty gritty details. They know I've been properly diagnosed. They'll notice when I lose a lot of weight. My mom will sometimes comment on it. My dad never does. If they don't see me eat for a long time, they'll ask about when the last time I ate was. Overall, they don't really stick their noses too much into it. Probably because (due to my Hoshimoto's disorder and low thyroid), no matter how much i restrict and over exercise, I never lose enough weight to look dangerously emaciated, and my BMI tends to stay towards the low end of normal. So obviously it's not as serious, right? -.-

Anyways, I have trigger foods, of course. There are specific foods that I ask my mom not to have in the house. It's not a long list. It really only consists of a few things, sweets like: pecan rolls, a couple specific kinds of cereals, a couple specific kinds of donuts, a couple specific kinds of candy, and one type of cookie. White chocolate macadamia nut. When I say a couple specific, I do really mean like 2 or 3 kinds. That leaves at least a dozen other options in each category. In total, the list is probably less than 10 things.

Now she knows the reason. It's not like I asked and said ""just because."" I SPECIFICALLY told her, I don't want them around me, because if I have one, I will binge and then purge. If I'm already in a binge/purge episode, it's almost guaranteed. If I'm not, it can lead to a binge, and start me into one of those episodes.

She KNOWS. that I have a VERY legitimate reason to be afraid of having them in the house.

She does ok with not buying candy or donuts very often. She still buys all the other foods on my short list, though. I do my best and can usually keep myself away from them. Though that usually leads to me restricting even more, so I can feel like I have more control to keep myself from eating them.

Now, the white chocolate macadamia nut cookies. I dont know why, but they are the bane of my existence. Those are the problem.

My dad likes having cookies around for a before bed treat. He's not picky. He likes all cookies. I've asked him, in front of my mom, if he cares if she does not bring those ones home. He said no, they're not even his favorite, so he does not care.

My mom brings them home at least every other week. And at this point, it makes me SO. MAD. She's not even TRYING to take into consideration the ONE thing I've asked her to help me with. Why????? So when she brings them home, I throw them out. I'm fucking sick of it. It makes me mad. I know im wasting food and I feel bad wasting money. BUT IF SHE DOESNT WANT ME TO THROW THEM OUT, ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS PICK ONE OF THE OTHER 10 KINDS OF COOKIES. And she won't. So is it wrong of me to do that?

TL;DR I ask my mom not to bring home a certain trigger food for my eating disorder. She doesn't care, so I throw them out whenever she buys them. Is that wrong?",1565261615,8/8/2019 5:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cnk2ek/request_mother_buys_my_trigger_foods_is_it_ok_if/,13
1504,ctgdzy,Request: How should I talk about my child's mom's eating disorder to him?," 

To give some background, I am a single dad and am no longer with my son's mom. We were in a relationship for roughly 5 years. We had a child at the end of our relationship and are working to co-parent our child. She has recieved therapy, both inpatient and outpatient, for roughly 20 years including several dozen times of inpatient and basically constant outpatient over the years.

I understand a lot about how to support recovery myself as I've gone through years of support groups, therapy sessions with her and on my own, yet I know that there is always more to learn.

My child's mom is currently in inpatient. It's not the first time since our child has been born. But our child is getting older and has some more questions (and fears) about it. The little one is roughly about school age.

How should I explain this to them? What should I tell them? How specific should I be? What should I avoid?

Our child absolutely loves mom and rightfully is concerned about her. There are questions about what this place is that she is at and whether she is sick or is going to get better.

I don't want to lie. I want to tell the truth in a way that is able to be understood. And I definitely don't want to scare.

But the truth is that this is going to be something that is lifelong. There will likely be inpatient treatment at least once a year. There will be mental health and emotional issues that will come up with her. And we will all have to deal with that together.

How do I explain this?",1566391766,8/21/2019 7:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ctgdzy/request_how_should_i_talk_about_my_childs_moms/,7
1505,ctgdru,Request: I Finally Admitted To Maybe Having A Problem?,"I have been in a lot of therapy over the past few years. It was always focused on some PTSD from childhood abuse. I never thought I had a problem with body image and eating. The environment I grew up in was normal to have some insecurity. I grew up watching my mom diet off and on. My dad talking about starving being a good thing. There was constant talk of your body not looking how it should.

It wasn't until I went to college I started to realize I had a problem. I was never really comfortable with my body but I wasn't that bad. Then I got off some medication I had been on and started losing weight. It felt great. I was getting more compliments. I felt more confident. It was all great until I stopped eating. I started getting comments of being too thin. Jokes about feeding me started. I was miserable because I finally felt good about how I looked. Then I started not feeling so good. Then I felt bad because everyone had something bad to say about how I looked. I hated being so thin. So I made it my goal to gain weight.

I moved back home to help my mom recover from an accident. At that time I saw a doctor who told me I was malnourished and needed to start taking some supplements and start eating more. I was at risk of heart issues and stomach issues. So I started eating more. For two years I didn't gain weight. Found out I needed to eat even more. Not just two to three meals a day.

So I met my husband and he wanted to help me gain weight. So now I have gained weight. I am told I look super healthy. I feel so uncomfortable. I have such a hard time accepting it. That I have to eat. That the weight I gained is good. I have to eat though so I don't have anxiety spikes. I saw a friend post about losing weight and my first thought was working out and not eating.

In the last few months I worked through a lot of issues and now this is bubbling up. So I talked to a therapist about it. It feels like I am at the bottom of a mountain right now. I don't even feel like I can say I have an ed. I feel like a fraud. I feel scared when I can't have food. I feel angry at having to eat it. I don't know how to feel about my body. I don't know what's me.

Essentially my body has changed since starting recovery. Personally, I am happy with these changes, but they're-how do I put it- not what society considers ideal. I can imagine a partner would be a bit surprised seeing me naked for the first time. 

What is a comfortable way of approaching this? Should I tell a potential partner about my insecurities. Should I tell them my body has changed? Say nothing and hope they don't say anything back?

This went on and off until halfway through my junior year when I fell in love with a wonderful boy who gave me a giant reality check and I was able to heal for the most part.

It’s been a little under year now since I’ve completely changed my mindset about my disordered eating (I’ve never been diagnosed with anything but obviously I know there’s an issue).  I recently started birth control and I gained a few pounds, which makes me technically overweight (but just barely). I’ve been eating more and more and I feel like I can’t control myself.

Along with this I went and looked at tumblr again and it just egged the thoughts on. I don’t want to be unhealthy but I know for sure I can’t lose weight without hurting myself.

My biggest reason for not just diving in is because I know my boyfriend doesn’t deserve that. He’s been with me through this the entire time and he says my body is perfect. 

And I can see that I’m attractive- I get a lot of compliments and there are days where I very much feel confident and comfortable in my skin.

But I just can’t get weight loss out of my head. It’s so, so tempting and it’d be so easy since school is starting up. 

All my old thoughts are hitting me full force and I can’t take it anymore. 

I can’t keep eating with no limits because I don’t want to be unhealthy or gain more weight. 

I can’t lose weight because I’m not in a mental place to do so.

Any and all help is appreciated. Thank you for reading.",1566081308,8/17/2019 17:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/crt1c1/request_im_completely_stuck/,1
1521,crt1a1,Request: Post request: I think I have an ED,"I’m really feeling low right now. This is the first time I’ve ever considered this as a true possibility and I want to get help. But asking for it is so terrifying to me. A little backstory, when I was around 9, I was so underweight that my parents sent me to therapy. It was traumatic and I’ve been terrified of the concept ever since. But ever since I was in middle school and people would whisper about me, I remember starving myself, I would skip breakfast and lie to my parents that I had eaten lunch at school. I’ve always been a picky eater and they would force me to eat whatever they cooked. My relationship with food has never been good. I hate it. I wish I didn’t need to eat to survive. I wish I didn’t feel hunger. Because when I do that’s when I binge. I eat and eat until I’m full and I hate myself. And then the next day I’ll starve myself to make up for it. And it’ll be an endless cycle of starving and binging, and hating myself all throughout. 

I want to get better. I want to eat an appropriate amount of cals and lose weight in a healthy way. I don’t want to look in the mirror and be disgusted.

1523,cqxqwz,Request: Friend may have an eating disorder,"For the past few months, I have been extremely worried about a friend who may or may not have an eating disorder. We both do ballet together and the other girls in the class are also concerned about how skinny she has gotten through the past year. Since we're around her so much, everyone in the class didn't notice her slowly losing weight until a girl who took a break from ballet came back and commented on how skinny she has gotten. It has been a few months later and she still seems to be extremely thin with seeing her whole ribcage in the back when she bends over. 

About a year ago, she used to complain about how fat she was and told us she dropped a significant amount of weight in a year -- she was normal weight for her height, but always complained about the fat on her stomach. 
Whenever we would all go out together, she would look concerned over eating sweet food and constantly looked at nutrition labels. She has a ton of muscle and does not look nearly underweight with clothes on most likely preventing her family to notice how thin she has become.

Recently I invited her out to lunch and she ordered a healthy Mediterranean crepe and I saw her only take a few bites of lettuce and olives before saving the rest of it claiming her mom will eat it. 

I am getting increasingly concerned over her eating habits especially since her sister went through anorexia, although she is supposedly recovered. I don't know how to approach her about it and tell her how concerned everyone is about her without offending and making her more self conscious. She is way too young to be worried about calories and eating too much especially since she does ballet and figure skating.",1565910989,8/15/2019 18:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cqxqwz/request_friend_may_have_an_eating_disorder/,8
1524,cqxqu3,Request: Puppy to the “rescue”?,"I’ve read about how emotional support dogs (ESD) can help people with eating disorders. But ESD’s cannot go into restaurants or any public area really. The only places they are allowed is airplanes with no extra fees and they are allowed to be brought into any home, even if it’s “no dogs, pets, etc allowed”. 

Here is what I was diagnosed with:
-Avoidant/Restrictant Food Intake Disorder 
-Anorexia Nervosa 
-Severe Social Anxiety Disorder 
-A major depression disorder
-Severe anxiety (different from social anxiety) 

To calm myself down, I will look at videos of fogs and I will usually be okay in 20 minutes. However, that’s not always available for me to do. I’m getting a puppy soon so this is why I’ve been looking into it. 

Could a service dog be a better choice because it can calm me down in restaurants, and other public places (where an ESD cannot. They only can at home and are only there for comfort. They have no training). Since they have to do a specific task, pressure therapy to calm anxiety would be one of those tasks, and keeping people away from me when needed (creating a barrier). It can also remind me to eat so many times a day or to take medication I’m on or go on in the future. 

However... service dogs take 2 years to train I’ve heard. At that point I’m well into college and a service dog may not be able to come wherever I go. Is it possible to train a service dog, for a low price, in 6 months or less? Also, is a service dog worth it for treatment for depression, anxiety, social anxiety, and 2 different ED’s? I’m not sure how to talk to my parents about it, especially if they don’t want to spend the money.

A bit of back story- I’m 15, for just over a year I’ve been dealing with disordered eating (not gonna call it an eating disorder because I’m not diagnosed). First it started out as restricting food, then purging then going back to normal eating. About 8 months ago it started getting worse, I lost my period, starting eating little to nothing, and binging every few days. As a result my hair started falling out and I dropped out of school as my self esteem was non existent. 

I’m still a little over weight, but my eating habits and how I see myself has really taken over my life so that’s why I want to start getting better and living my life instead of being preoccupied by food. I’ve lost so many people that meant so much to me all over food. 

My parents aren’t around very much so I’m left to do whatever I want, which really doesn’t help when it comes to recovery.",1566954730,8/27/2019 20:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cwdos7/request_how_did_you_push_yourself_into_recovery/,11
1526,cwdopz,Request: Recovery phase 2?,"I reached my goal weight and have been at a healthy weight for many months now. I still have the ED voice all the time but I’m getting better at ignoring it. I don’t fully restrict, but occasionally I’ll skip, especially when my hunger cues aren’t there and it’s just knowledge/will power.

I’ve always been a long distance runner and am currently training for a 10k this fall. Part of doing this is weight lifting training. I found a great personal trainer and have shared my eating disorder with him and he’s been a big part of encouraging me to get back to eating and I’m eating mostly regularly now.

However, I came close to fainting yesterday at the gym. Black fuzzy vision, dizziness, ringing sounds, and dilated pupils. I hadn’t eaten enough that day, I had given into imagined pressure from work to limit my eating.

I really really want to continue working out with my trainer, but to do so I need to eat more, have snacks before, especially on workout days. I’m scared of eating and gaining weight though!

Why is this such a hard thing to make a choice to eat normally when I want to do more that I can’t do if I under eat. I don’t even look like I have an eating disorder now, so complaining about food being scary falls on deaf ears even from my family.

1527,cwdo6q,Request: What is enough exercise?,"Hello all, I’ve been struggling with what is enough in terms of exercise as of late. I work full time during the days and have class at night, so I’m often extremely busy. Before going back to school and working, I used to regularly log 2+ hours of cardio and lifting at the gym on top of rowing crew. I was a coxswain and quickly developed an eating disorder, which is sadly common.  

I’ve been working hard to recover from my anorexia and now have a new battle. Since I’m so busy logging 40 hours at work and then another 20 or so hours for school, I’ve had less time to go to the gym. I’ve fallen into bad habits and haven’t been eating a lot and feel awful about it. Because I have no time or energy to exercise, I’ve been supplementing by not eating. That isn’t a good idea. On top of getting serious about eating right, I wanted to try and bring back 30 minutes of exercise a couple times a week to feel stronger and cut this bad habit. I felt stronger when I worked out, but I’m unsure how much exercise is enough to be strong and healthy and what is excessive.

My question to everyone is how much is enough exercise to be healthy? I know that is subjective, but I’m still confused. I get caught up in that and feel like my idea of going on walks for lunch break and doing some bodyweight exercise a few times a week isn’t enough. Does anyone have any thoughts or ideas on this?

1528,cw2f2l,"Request: Previously restricting, now also purging, and I am horribly scared","
For most of my ED history I have only been restricting, with some binges here and there.

Last Autumn, though, in the midst of a very bad relapse, I ""discovered"" purging. I only used it as an ""emergency measure"" after binges (turns out, restriction and weight loss makes you more prone to binges! Who'd have thought!) and no more than once a week tops. After a visit with a dietitian, some weight gain and a more regular eating schedule I managed to stop it after a couple months.

Around May, I started again. Still no more than once a week, maybe twice a week in the worst periods.

I am currently experiencing another AN relapse - I am underweight and losing weight, I am only eating once a day and sometimes I binge due to extreme hunger. And when I binge, I purge. I feel this is getting more frequent.

Today I had a particularly violent purge. It is the second time this week and the fourth once since August. I am SO SCARED. Mostly due to my teeth - I know that even a few months of occasional purging can do damage, damage which can't be undone and can have long-lasting effects even if you stop purging. I feel that my teeth are becoming more yellow, thin and sensitive, but I don't know how much is reality and how much is just my imagination. I have had dental issues for a long time prior to my ED and I go to the dentist pretty often; I was there in July and she apparently didn't notice anything wrong but what do I know?

What I do know is that logically, since I only purge when I binge and generally I can manage to avoid binges (or at least to make them less frequent) if I do not restrict so heavily, I should stop restricting so heavily. But I can't. The mere idea of not skipping breakfast tomorrow is completely alien, it's like telling me to fly to the Moon. I just can't.

I need help. But I live in a country where I don't speak the language and I am not entitled to public healthcare because I am not a citizen. Please I will only stay here for a few months (my activity requires me to move on a regular basis) and a few months can't do shit when it comes to eating disorders.

I am completely out of control and don't know what to do. I need to stop and I need to stop fast but I don't know how.",1566900981,8/27/2019 5:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cw2f2l/request_previously_restricting_now_also_purging/,2
1529,cw2d8l,Request: ED toughts haunting my body image and self confidense A LOT while trying to get bigger and stronger,"I feel like shit.  
Quick facts about me: I’ve just turned 19, I’m in the normal height + weight range.
 

I know this whole fitness/bodybuilding/weightlifting thing is a LIFESTYLE. I know that you must stay committed and do the right things to achieve your goals, but at this moment in my life I feel like this so called “lifestyle” has become a mental disorder (I’ve met 3 different therapists without any positive progress, I’m writing this because…I simply find it relieving). 

Everything in my life revolves around lifting and nutrition. Long story short I made an unhealthy weight loss 1-2 years ago by the “help” of an eating disorder. I strictly restricted my calories to a low level while playing soccer for the first team 4x a week and strength trained 4x a week plus an extra cardio session, while I still grew and was in mid-puberty… Also, I broke up with the most perfect girl at this time after a 2,5year relationship since I had no energy to pretty much feel love as strange as it may sound. Since then I’ve tried to bulk up by lean bulking- but due to feeling fat, loosing definition, getting a little chubbier, retaining water and so on I’ve never committed to a bulk fully. I’ve been throwing in “mini cuts” because I know that *you shouldn’t bulk at a high BF.* As a former overweight kid that went from being the fat kid everyone loved to grab the stomach on to and laugh, to being anorexic with no energy to live, minimum bodyfat but veins popping EVERYWHERE (even though there was very little muscle) it is mentally hard to let your body gain, to accept abs disappearing- which they do pretty fast since the abs I had was due to being skinny not having developed abdominal muscles.  
  The common rules for bulking is to keeping a bulk slow, limit fat gain, only gain a certain amount  per month- and so I yo-yo diet

Due to this YoYo-dieting, due to spinning my fucking wheels, I’ve not seen much progress past. This lack of progress makes me want to progress even more. That’s good right? I got motivation?! No, not really. This makes me want to do everything perfect, which affects my life A LOT and everything feels like a chore nowadays, I barely find it “fun”. I can’t eat out with friends; I skip social events unless I’ve planned exactly everything in beforehand, I get anxiety knowing it’s my mothers, fathers, brother or even my own birthday, cause I know it will be hard to say no to the cake- because I don’t know the macros. My friends, who are normal people, who also lift, and look maybe even better than me, occasionally go out and eat pizza, drink some beers and have a good time with friends- they do this randomly and I can’t do this unless, like in previous examples, have planned out the foods, sleep, training etc. I can get anxious for a social event 3 weeks in beforehand knowing it will affect nutrition, sleep and training- and often start planning when to train, what to eat, how to fit everything in perfectly in order to not ruin my progress. I plan excuses to use in order to avoid eating things I can’t track or going home earlier to get the food I need in while not eating anything the whole evening. I’m moving away from home in order to study in 1 week and for the past 2 weeks I’ve had anxiety over the social events that will come. There is a tradition here were students at university gather pretty much everyday for 3 weeks after studying to party, get to know each other and have fun. I MUST attend some of those events because I do not know a single soul in the new city I’m moving to and need at least some friend.

Everything seems to be related to my self confidence and body image. I really feel like I look like shit and in order to be happy I need to improve my physique. I feel like that is the only way I will achieve happiness and self-confidence. Right now, I really avoid taking my shirt of in public, I avoid going swimming with friends when I know there will be a lot of people, especially girls. I even avoid taking my shirt of in front of my family. My mood is based on how I look.

About the girls… I cant even get into a relationship right now since first of all, who could bear with me and my constant need of control over everything, second of all, I wouldn’t be able to prioritize my partner and third of all I lack the confidence to get naked, have sex (lost virginity before everything got fucked up)- even for one night stands. This frustrates me because lately a lot of girls have been approaching me, and this is not me bragging it’s the truth, but It doesn’t matter since I can’t handle it. I avoid them.

Sorry for the long rant but sometimes I wish I just was normal, no matter how I looked, but felt life was awesome. Now, that everything revolves around gym, nutrition and how my body looks, it feels impossible to do so. I live with the constant thought of going all in or nothing, which for some people might be good- but for me is a hell.

Some of you may see me as a pussy, as someone who just needs to STFU and train because you must be dedicated.   
 No matter what, I feel awful. I don’t have friends or family who understands me. I feel like I’m alone in this and like I’m slowly wasting my youth- but even though I’ve realized these facts, my head, thoughts and mentality does not let me change anything. Big ups to everyone who took their time to read all of this and feel free to ask ANYTHING. Any thoughts, tips or whatever are appreciated.

So for around 3-4 years I struggled pretty heavily with an eating disorder. It mostly consisted of exercising waaaaay more than healthy but I would also count calories, almost always skip meals or eat something super tiny, and vomit when I felt I had failed. It got to the point where I was eating barely anything and still working out usually twice a day and usually to the point of passing out or vomiting.

I had a pee test for something the other week, and the doctor commented that one of the things in it, I forget what, suggested my body was eating its muscles, due to lack of food, and had me stand on a scale to see my weight. When I think about it, I've only been eating one proper meal a day or less. I just don't have the appetite, and other than that...I'm just apathetic. It's just that I could get away with it until now because when I was unemployed I wasn't moving around much, whereas my job has me spend a lot of time on my feet and doing things. For some reason, when I was told that, I was just amused, and I still can't really bring myself to care for myself about that. A part of me wants to see how long I can keep going like that.

I spoke to a friend of mine, and she thinks I have an eating disorder, because I don't eat, and don't care much, and because I'm afraid of how I'll look if I put on weight. I'm trans, and I'm afraid it'll make me look even worse and the fat will go to the wrong places. But it's not like I starve myself, exactly...I just don't get very hungry, or try to eat a lot.

It was a very long and painful process that required my mom to finally become heavily involved and my boyfriend as well. During residential both on their own separate days would go visit me. My mom for family therapy and my boyfriend to hang out, go out. My mom since I graduated IOP has been semi involved by asking random questions about how I am and if I have eaten and now she will absolutely not mention my weight like at all. She still keeps some space regarding the topic and doesn’t seem to want to know more and I don’t blame her.

My boyfriend on the other hand has never really wanted to get to know my struggle with my eating disorder and how it has deeply affected my life. All the personal information and gross secrets I have shared with him because I bring them up. He however has not asked me on his own account.

Now I did voice this to him once and he immediately apologized and asked me how I was doing but in that moment it felt fake and phony and I got uncomfortable. The second time I was crying and very mad and told him and opened up about the fact that now a year later into recovery I am struggling bad. He apologized again and said it was so shitty how he has never asked me.

Fast forward almost three weeks and not once has he asked me anything or tried to truly get to understand this situation. I feel like I am battling this alone again and I simply cannot get myself to open up anymore because I feel so rejected.

She had some minimal outpatient care as a minor but is since an adult and we're struggling to get her into an outpatient program. She's very high functioning but also very sick but wants to get better.

I was just wondering from the perspective of people with eating disorders or people who have recovered, what's something that the people in your life could do/have done in order to help your recovery that you would have never outright asked for?

An example would be taking away something (scales), or maybe cancelling a gym membership on their behalf. Even forcing someone to be admitted to an inpatient program. I don't want to ask my sister what I can do because I have a feeling even if she knows having her gym membership cancelled would help, she won't tell me that because it's the eating disorder speaking and she doesn't want anything taking away from it.

I know that it's messy with autonomy but there is evidence that those with eating disorders aren't fully competent to make certain decisions. I know she won't tell me what she needs but I want advice on things I can actively do that she might thank me for later. Like I said it's been a decade, so things like ""just listen to her"" and ""see a dietician"" aren't working. She needs intervention and we want to avoid inpatient unless you guys think THAT is the best thing I can do for her.",1566899605,8/27/2019 4:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cw27d1/request_what_actions_did_you_wish_others_took_or/,8
1538,curdx4,Request: Recovery: weight gain questions?,"Hi. 
I posted on here a while ago about struggling to gain weight- and I gained it!

Thing is, this is the biggest I’ve ever been, but I’m inexperienced in weight gain and I don’t know if this is how I’m supposed to look? I’m not sure how to phrase it. I haven’t gained much weight at all on my lower half, it all seems to go to my torso? Nowhere else is showing much of a difference besides my arms, and that’s mostly because I’ve been working them out a lot. My legs just seem to be staying skinny. 

Is this how weight gain looks when you first start gaining it properly? I’ve significant increased how much I eat. From one meal a day that I would barely finish, or some random snacks, to three meals, a snack and sometimes a calorie milkshake. 

Is my body just adjusting? I mean, will the weight even out across my body eventually? Or does it take longer to gain weight on your lower half? I’m starting to look ‘top heavy’ now, and before I was the total opposite. Not gaining any weight on my bum and legs (except a very minor amount) is really discouraging me from eating properly and I’m fighting the urge to give in and stop eating again.",1566639428,8/24/2019 4:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/curdx4/request_recovery_weight_gain_questions/,8

Thing is I'm wakening up in the morning and I feel horrendous. I am weak, sore, exhausted, my chest is tight, simple movements feel heavy and strenuous. I am constantly choked and worn down and I feel like my legs could buckle at any moment.

I'm scared.

No. Maybe that's a bit strong. I'm concerned. I only left inpatient in March and I have essentially removed myself entirely from services because  I know what I need to do"" and ""after 13 years of treatment I don't think there's much more you can offer me""

Truth is though I know I've slipped. And I know im not much heavier than I was the last time I got admitted. And I do know what I need to do. Obviously. So why have I not done it yet?

I don't have children but I do have animals and in my personal opinion. There's no difference. I have 4 lives that absolutely depend on me and by refusing to reverse (not just halt) this path of self destruction, I put those lives at risk. I love them with every fibre of my being but I am going to hurt them. If I don't start to undo this damage, I AM GOING TO HURT THEM.

In 13/14 years, I've spent maybe 1 of that (split up) at a semi reasonably healthy weight. My body must be absolutely well and truly fucked. I guess my problem is that I really don't give a shit. If I'm honest with myself, I want my entire being to be ripped apart and annihilated, battered, trampled, burned at the stake.

Thing is, I've always had a fall back. A ""hero"" by the name of Caroline to swoop in and cart me off to the ED nut house when it got too bad.

Things are nearing that point now and nobody is going to swoop in and save me this time. It's nobody's choice but mine. And thatd be fine n dandy if it was just my life. But it's not. If I crash (which I will if I don't make that choice to actually reverse this damage - ie, cut behaviours and put some damn weight on), my babies crash with me. And for that, I would absolutely deserve to die.

Im looking at my beautiful innocent little pup right now and I feel sick. I am a monster.

Something needs to change. For his sake. Even if I don't deserve a life, he does. And I need to be here, present and fucking SANE to give him it.",1566639418,8/24/2019 4:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/curdw4/request_post_request_i_feel_ill/,4

I’ve been deferred from the only ED clinic accepted by my insurance multiple times, despite my primary, my therapist, and my psychiatrist all insisting that I need to be seen and repeatedly referring me. They saw me for a consultation a few months ago and they waited at least a month to tell me that they won’t be seeing me again due to the fact that I’ve been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. I’m fairly certain that the fact I’m male has something to do with it too. I am going to end up hospitalized if this goes on. I can’t figure out what to do. I’ve been trying to work it out myself but I just can’t. I can’t keep going on like this. I also can’t afford a hospital stay no matter what. I was recently fired from my job and I haven’t had any luck finding a new one. I have no idea what to do.

1544,ctuyb4,Request: Is this considered binging?,"I’m new to the ED community so please bare with me. Recently, I’ve learned that in the ED community, that rather than binging being defined as “eating a gross amount of food in a short amount of time,” that it actually takes a broader definition as “out of control eating, with a somewhat dissociative feeling” or something along the lines of that. Upon learning this, I’m confused whether or not I binge, so it would really help if I could get other people’s opinions. 

I normally restrict/fast, sometimes I do OMAD (my dinner) if I’m able to. However, when it comes to dinner, 99% of the time I will overeat, but I don’t know if I feel “out of control?” I guess feeling out of control is really subjective, but here’s a rundown of how dinner goes for me every night. I’ll normally plan my meals on MFP but end up eating more because my family eats family style, so it’s really easy to just lose track. (Since we do family style every night, I can’t just make my own bowl because they would figure out so quick about my habits.) By the time I’m full, I’ll continue eating and it’s not like I DON’T want to eat the food. It’s more like one half of my brain is going “this tastes soooo good, keep eating,” the other half of my brain is going “omg the calories, omg the calories, omg the calories.” But my stomach is literally going, “oh GOD please stop I’m full.” And every time by the end of my meal, I feel bloated and uncomfortably full and just shitty because I ate more than I planned. The amount I eat isn’t a GROSS amount of food compared to what I’ve seen others eat, it’s just more than I eat during my restrictive meals and that’s why I feel so bloated.

I guess when I put it like this, it really does sound disordered and like a binge. I think I’m just in denial because I’m new to this community and it’s hard to believe I’ve ended up here. Generally, I feel pretty invalid about this whole ED situation. I eat more calories than most people in the ED community do, I don’t have triggers, I don’t have a fear food (I literally will...eat anything.), I don’t even think I have safe foods either (I feel anxious about ANYTHING with calories). Sorry for the long post but nonetheless, opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance. :-/",1566466046,8/22/2019 4:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ctuyb4/request_is_this_considered_binging/,27
1545,czikxf,Request: Post request! -binge eating/anorexia: never ending cycle,"I’ve been struggling with the binge eat, gain weight, then starve and lose it all cycle for years and years. I starve and become too thin and people worry, and then suddenly I spend one night binging and it’s all I do for the next 3 weeks, or months. I don’t understand how no one has noticed this cycle of me being thin and then a little chubby over and over. My eating habits have been severely disordered since I was 14, I am almost 21 now. Looking back and seeing myself now I don’t know how no one has known.  When I was 13 I was put into a residential treatment center for a year which is where my disorder really developed. I don’t think the staff there were fully equipped to know how to deal with this and it just got worse when I left. I heavily abused laxatives from 15-16, was always a little underweight as a teen and the past 2 years have just been an endless cycle of binge then starve. I feel so lost in this, I’ll binge and binge until my stomach literally looks 6 months pregnant and I cannot move. I don’t know how to reach out and let people know this is bigger than it may appear. I’m suffering so much and I know my body is too, constantly going from one extreme to the other. I also deal with Irritable bowel syndrome so when I force my body to take in mass amounts of foods it doesn’t like I become very sick, but that doesn’t stop me. 

I’ve also had two serious boyfriends who also dealt with eating disorders(bulimia) and I can’t imagine that has helped me.  I never feel happy with my body either way. I finally told my mom a few months ago how bad this was when I had lost a large amount of weight after a painful breakup, and I’m on a waitlist at a treatment facility for outpatient therapy, but I don’t know if I can wait. I’ve since gained the weight back and probably plus some. I’m currently in the binge part of the cycle but I know soon I’ll break down and the starving will return.

1546,cz47l6,Request: Responding to the question “Do you think I’m fat?”,"Some background info: My girlfriend and I have been together for just over 3 years. In all the time I’ve known her she’s been underweight, and she recently confided in me that she has had a difficult relationship with food for a long time. She was diagnosed with an eating disorder just under a year ago and around then she lost a significant amount of weight in a short period of time.

Since then she has made some amazing steps and has put some weight back on (although she is still a ways away from her weight when we first met, and by extension what her doctor would classify as healthy) as well as tackling the psychological aspect of recovery head on.

I’m extremely proud of her and trying to be as supportive as possible and this sub has been incredibly helpful for advice, but one thing I’m still struggling with is the question she sometimes asks: “Do you think I’m fat/gross/heavy?” I’m struggling with how to answer this in the best way and I hoped I could get some advice from you all. 

So far, I have responded with a “No.” followed by changing the subject slightly by telling her how proud I am of the progress she’s made in such a short space of time, trying to draw attention to the positives of her recovery so far without focussing on the weight.

One thing I’ve been actively trying to avoid saying is something like “No, you look healthy” or “No you look fine”. Some other threads I have read on this sub suggested that telling someone they look “healthy” can also be demoralising, and I feel to say “fine” would be to downplay the progress she has made. 

In addition to this I’m also trying to avoid this language so as not to normalise the weight she is currently at, although I am wondering if this is a valid concern?

1556,cynfjm,Request: Advice,"How to handle being around a friend who is showing signs of severe orthorexia/anorexia while being in early recovering from binging? 

I (25F) have been in the process of recovery from orthorexic turned binging behaviors for the past year with the help of a professional. It's only been recently (around two weeks, where I have seen a marked improvement in my mentality and behaviors). Unfortunately due to scheduling conflicts my therapist is no longer available and I am hesitant about starting all over with a new one. I did not think I urgently needed more professional support as I had gradually sought her support less and less as I improved. 

However after reconnecting with an old friend who I believe has severe body image issues herself, I ended up binging again after 2 weeks of no relapses. During our interactions I made sure to be very aware of my thoughts and even felt more strongly about practicing what I have learnt in the past year. I even ate what I wanted while she watched and ate nothing (something that would've been out of the question before). I still had body discomfort that was more pronounced as I still have the tendency to compare my physique (which has grown bigger during recovery) to those who were similar or larger than me a few years ago.  I briefly shared my current mentality on food with her, although I did not want to be overbearing about my views on food, so I think she has an inkling of my issues. I also brought up orthorexia in the community of which she also sees as a big problem.

Before this I have hinted at a binging/orthorexic behavior to her and my other friends but I have never outright admitted to it. Should I be more blatant about talking about my experience - but I don't want to be too preachy as I know when I was in the thick of it I detested and ignored other people's comment on my diet.

Should I minimize interactions with her until I have a stronger grasps on my own behaviors?

1559,cy2k6u,Request: ward experiences,"Hi I'm (15F) and I was hospitalized earlier this year.
Personally I hated my experience and it didn't exactly motivate me to get better. I'm just really confused by everything.

I stayed at the hospital a bit and nothing noteworthy happened there, but soon I was moved to a psych ward. The place wasn't specifically for eating disorder patients, but there were a couple others. First evening I struggled to eat, and the guy watching my meal just basically started yelling at me. 

Next odd thing to me was the constant surveillance which yea I get the point, but it was uncomfortable, like wherever we went there was a nurse listening and it was so awkward I guess.

I hated the ward so much, it felt like punishment more then anything. We would literally get told that ""This isn't a place to be happy, focus on your treatment"" if we were having ""too much"" fun (I mean like just laughing loudly and cracking jokes and chilling with each other)
Another specific instance was when I was having trouble eating at all and I had been refusing to drink the meal replacement thingy. A guy just starting on his shift comes in takes the drink pours it in the sink and says that I'm just wasting everyone's time.

The last thing is that no one has ever mentioned putting me in theraphy. Not even in the checkups. I mean they just make me go to some family sessions, but nothing individually for me.

1561,cx9xke,Request: Post Request: I think my GF has an eating disorder,"I love my girlfriend but I think she has an eating disorder.

Here’s the back story. Early in our relationship my girlfriend of over 8 months has told me she has bad IBS and can only eat a small handful of items. She is an avid exerciser including the gym but mostly running 20+ miles a week. She runs 5k’s often. Usually we eat together but lately she has been declining to eat saying she’s not hungry, or just not interested in the 4-5 items she can eat. She does drink coffee and beer though, and I suspect gets many of her calories from them. Often, but not always she will tell me she feels really sick from not eating and then she cannot eat and just has to lay down and recover.

Recently we went on a trip with my family. She told me to let my family know that they don’t need to cook for her, as she will be handling her own food needs. I understand completely as she needs to make sure certain products are not in her food. However, during the trip she did not want to sit down with my family for dinner and eat because according to her ‘she didn’t want to be singled out as someone who isn’t eating anything or eats too little’.  I initially accepted this, but then on one night she was laying down and I was extremely concerned. I talked to her and she said she was hungry but didn’t get anything to eat, and that she was now too sick to eat. This isn’t the first time, but this triggered me to be worried about her health in a way I have never considered before. I did some research and I am worried she has a disorder. I have to say something to her, but I don’t know if I am completely off base, or what I should say to her. I am worried she is either unaware of the disorder, or she knows about it and will deny that it exists.

Am I wrong? I have to say something, but I am hoping someone who has better knowledge in this area can help me. I just feel completely lost.",1567127389,8/29/2019 20:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cx9xke/request_post_request_i_think_my_gf_has_an_eating/,5

She'd skip breakfast and lunch, then tell our parents she ate a lot during the day to skip dinner. At first, I thought she was eating snacks when I wasn't looking, but it was getting pretty obvious that she just was not eating at all. I told my parents what I had noticed, and then they put her into therapy and pulled her out of her dance classes, which has been making her absolutely miserable. She knows that I'm the one who said something and is pissed about it. I feel awful that I caused her to get pulled out of dance, but I do want her to get the help she needs. But it's hard to deal with my sister hating me. I know, it's the eating disorder talking, not her, but a lot of it is still coming out of her mouth and I hate having to hear that from my sister.

1564,d30rph,Request: ED recovered with ED best friend,"28f. I recovered over the last 4 years. I had a secret ED from 11-24, and I eat mindfully but not restrictively and I'm very healthy now. My best friend has finally accepted that she has one. For the last 3 years, it's gotten bad. She's a binger, but often tries to purge/abstain with little success (not that it makes a difference. Urges still there, still dangerous no matter what)

For the last 2 years, I've tried to tell her that her negative talk about herself affects me. I've tried to set boundaries many times but she always ends up going back to her old way of talking around me. It even bleeds into her social media. It's almost daily that she brings up her weight and how massive and disgusting she is (her words)

But I think she's beautiful. I tell her so.

She weighs the same as me with the same body type and measurements almost exactly. This hurts me both for her and me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I absolutely do not want to cut my best friend of 12 years out of my life, but it's so hard for me to talk to her. It's LITERALLY every day, sometimes more than a few times. It coaxes my bad thoughts right back up. What can I do that I haven't already? I really don't want to be harsh to her. She refuses help because she says she isn't ready, even after I explained to her that she probably won't ever be.",1568252582,9/11/2019 20:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/d30rph/request_ed_recovered_with_ed_best_friend/,7

1567,d2nkmq,"Request: Male 21 5,6 trying to stop need advice"," I’ve finally decided to try and stop my Bulimia a month and a half ago after 4-5 years of on and off bulimia depending on how heavy I was and whether or not I was happy with it I’ve also worked out and had phases of working out for the past 4-5 years. Let’s just say I guess I was never serious about getting the body I wanted and thought I could cheat my way around it and it worked but that only depended on my binges and how often I purged. The more I binged the more I ate usually I would end up gaining weight then it would just be a cycle of me gaining weight because it got out of control for two weeks then results in me doing intense sweating exercises/ bulimia / Anorexia to really get the results I wanted and yes I got them, but that didn’t mean I was going to stay there for long at all.  Sometimes I would for a couple weeks maybe a couple months but nothing crazy. 

So this past month and a half I only relapsed like 2x which I felt was amazing I was feeling proud of myself and at the same time I wasn’t keeping track of my weight on my scale which was one of the main factors of why I care so much about my weight.  To now weighing myself for the first time in the past month and a half and I gained around 15 pounds. And I’ve really been trying to watch what I eat by that I mean I would regulate all my binges try to stay with two meals a day because I don’t wake up early for breakfast usually, ( I also usually eat diner around 12:30-1 am this past month and a half I know eating late is bad but I eat after the gym should I stop? ) so I thought I was doing good. 

My girlfriend wants me to go see a doctor/ therapist I honestly don’t care about a therapist like I know why I’m like this, I’m only open to the doctor side I haven’t gotten my blood work done like in a couple years, she’s worried I might have more underlying problems since it’s been so long. I feel like she could be right and wrong I would only benefit the doctor if like I could get some diet pills or something or is there any problem I should actually be worried about. Part of me feels like my body is fucked right now and can’t work properly digestively ( even tho it got better than a month and a half ago but I still have bad digestive problems ) I feel like something is off that I really absorb like 20x the calories I’m actually eating. And I do cardio as well I’ve been a more cardio person then weight lifting these past 5 years I don’t consider me to out of shape I can run a 9 min mile at least. 

So why did I gain this weight? Thats so much to me I understand my diet is not strict but should I try to buy macro plans a personal fitness to try to incorporate more? This is my worst fear, this is why I purge, this is what makes me hate my body sometimes and it’s making me want to relapse but I know that’s not the way to go I’m never going to Achieve what I want with myself. At this rate am I just going to keep gaining weight this fast? 

Should I be worried about other things?  Any people who have recovered reading this can you give me some Insight on how your recovery went? And what you did ?And how you were able to change your body successfully if it’s working or your experiencing the same issues as me. This is so frustrating also you guys should know I don’t have the best diet I sometimes eat junk foods late but I don’t binge I thought it would be okay if I just controlled it but it’s not like I have the best diet I do drink a lot of juices because I work at a restaurant and I buy drinks for home I do eat out a good amount but if I eat out I won’t eat again at home.",1568195159,9/11/2019 4:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/d2nkmq/request_male_21_56_trying_to_stop_need_advice/,6
1568,d2nka5,Request: I don't know what to call my ED,"In highschool I struggled with anorexia for two years as a means of control and self harm and won the battle by taking an antidepressant that made me hungry all of the time. Since then I had been doing really well, but recently my attitude towards food has changed dramatically. 

Eating takes time and energy and everything sounds revolting. If I am to eat, I only want to eat *this* thing or nothing at all. My recent food has been pickles. Everything that isn't pickles makes me want to throw up or starve. I recently read up on ARFID and I want to say it matches that, but I'm scared to give it a name. 

I also have something called Purely Obsessive Compulsive Disorder - which is essentially OCD, but instead of having compulsions, I obsess to no end about intrusive thoughts or feelings. Part of me wants to say that I'm just making this all up and imagining and obsessing over nothing, but I'm genuinely concerned for my health. Before this I have never been a picky eater. I was actually quite adventurous with my foods.

Here's my situation:
I'm a 22 year old male and struggling with depression and fluctuating weight for about 3 years. At the moment I'm bearly eating anything and my weight is slowly going down again. For the last 2 weeks in my vacation I lost control and couldn't really get out of bed and felt like sh*t and also gained some weight(Which again made me feel even worse). I think the only thing that keeps me from losing weight even faster is the Alkohol that I drink(0-3 Beers a day depending on how I feel). Also I've been selfharming since about a year as punishment for a whole lot of reasons (eating to much included) and because I can't bear the emptyness inside of me. 

The problem that I have now is, that I think that I'm not ""sick enough"" for a therapy. But the rational part of my brain wants me to get help.
I'm really lost at the moment and don't know what to do.

Now that I’m in college, I’ve been eating significantly less (almost 1-2 meals a day) and it being very rare that I eat 3 meals (each of my meals probably contained the amount of calories a large side salad and a wrap with vegis would have).

1571,d2a3ie,Informational Post: Have you heard of a disorder called ARFID?," 

A lot of people saw a BBC article about a boy recently who went blind because of malnutrition caused by his own poor diet. While the BBC briefly mentioned ARFID in their article, their title heavily capitalized on the stigma around picky eating, and other articles even went as far as to blame the victim, calling him fussy, or to blame his family.

[https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-british-teenager-is-blind-but-not-because-of-junk-food-or-fussy-eating/](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-british-teenager-is-blind-but-not-because-of-junk-food-or-fussy-eating/)

That boy suffered from ARFID, Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. ARFID is a more recent discovery among food disorders, being only a few years old, making it a recent addition to the DSM5.

ARFID is characterized by an unwillingness to eat anything except for certain ""safe foods."" People with ARFID come in all shapes and sizes and vary in what their safe foods are and how many they have. For some, ARFID seems to stem from childhood experiences with food, but that doesn't hold true for all. They often blame texture for why they don't like new foods. For someone with ARFID, trying new foods causes great anxiety or even panic attacks. Trying something new comes with the fear of throwing up. It doesn't matter how hungry you are, with ARFID, one will gladly starve instead of eating a non safe food.

With the stigma around picky eating, it's often difficult for someone with ARFID to eat out at restaurants or at friends' houses. People try to push eating new things without understanding how difficult ARFID makes it, and if you turn down any offers of food, people become worried or judgemental. People wonder how you can say you don't like a food you've never tried. Sometimes parents who's children have ARFID will force them to try new things or try to wean them off safe foods, but this tends to do more harm than good.

There's very little awareness about ARFID compared to other eating disorders, and it can be hard to find information about it. Right now, our subreddit is having a mass growth because of the BBC article. Many of us have suffered ARFID all our lives thinking that we were alone, suffering some strange, nameless thing that nobody else has. If you think you or someone you know may be suffering from ARFID, you are not alone.

We may not have a national ARFID day, but we have a support subreddit over at [/r/ARFID](https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID) . We also have a discord server you can join from there. Our subreddit has a WIP food encyclopedia pinned, which may help ARFID sufferers find foods that are very similar to their safe foods to try.

1572,d25h3m,Request: I (F20) cannot gain weight. Help me!!," 

Hi all, thanks for stopping by.

So my story in short:

* Prematurely born (2 months early, if that makes a difference)
* Have always been very underweight all my life.
* Recently dropped additional weight 4 weeks of July. Reason: Stomach ulcers and acid reflux. Could not eat a thing without nausea, hence eat less outside (but I worked then so yeah, majority of time outside). I never vomited.
* August: stopped working for vacation and health recovery. Went to hospital and dietary advisor.
* Now have been taking medicine to treat ulcers and acid reflux for 1 month.
* From could-eat-hardly-any-calories-per-meal beginning of August, I have improved gradually to eat normal-amount-per-meal. But usually I manage to eat less than I need per meal, which is frustrating  to me.
* Had a flu (with diarrhea and a lot of vomiting) last Friday and then all my efforts were gone. I lost the precious kg I'd just gained and now my stomach is also back to 1st August: tiny meals. I also don't want food and feel slight nausea when passing food's image or smell. (I still feel hungry.)

I just want to ask for advice or simply sympathy.

I am lost in various categories of eating disorders and could not find my category. So if anyone can enlighten me, yep please thank you so much!!

Also, I want to ask if anyone has a similar case? How could you improve your health (and gain weight, ofc!)?Should I exercise or not because my dietary advised me not to do gym or serious yoga (which were all my plans) due to my cannot-eat-anything?

As I browse the net, all advice for weight gaining is doing lifting and eat more calories. Upon reading those articles, all I want to do is cry a lot and hate myself, which then leads to worse stomach condition because of the whole mental health's effects on stomach's wellbeing. Also worth noting that I was diagnosed with emotional disorder (I know it's too broad but...) and haven't had chance to continue more with treating my mental health properly. I will, in some months!

This disorder has always come in waves for me, where sometime I don’t purge but instead just eat and feel disgusted with myself, and sometimes I purge. Sometimes I don’t purge for 6 months. Sometimes it’s a couple of times a week. That being said, I’ve never been able to get a handle on how I eat. 

What I don’t understand about this disorder, is where it comes from and if I should seek treatment for it. I’ve read that the treatment for bulimia is therapy and anti depressants.

1576,d25dm7,Request: Should I look for a new therapist?," 

Should I look for a new therapist? Is it wrong of me to feel this way about her ‘diagnosis’? Should I accept it?

I finally told my therapist everything. Well, I emailed it all to her prior to my session like the little chicken that I am but it counts. Basically I go through periods of binging and fasting. Fasts consisting of protein shakes, coffee, and zero solid foods and the most recent lasting a month). I have also used laxatives on occasion. Anyways, she told me that what she would call what I’ve been doing, or dealing with food addiction. This kind of took me by surprise. A year ago, I would have agreed. My life was basically one big emotional binge. I didn’t know any other way to eat. However now, now I hate myself for eating, and it feels like I’m doing what I should be doing as long as I’m not eating.

This is what’s driving me crazy. The thoughts in my head have gone haywire since she said that. It makes me feel like the same person I was 8 months ago (and significantly heavier), because that person I would agree probably had a food addiction. But for her to tell me I have one now, it basically validated all the thoughts that have been telling me to shut up and stop worrying about having a problem because I’m too fat to have a problem. My doctor who has been prescribing me phentermine to help me to lose weight (before all of this escalated) has also been referring to my problem as binge eating since I started seeing her late last year. I just feel like I’ve been labeled as the fat person with a food addiction, once again. So maybe I am just addicted to food. Maybe it is just binging and I’m being over dramatic about the rest of it. I truly don’t even know anymore. The thoughts in my head are more aggressive since that last session than they ever have been. I can’t think straight or do anything else I know I should be doing. I’ve lost the one close friend I had here and I’m literally across the country from home and family. I don’t even know why I’m even writing all of this out as I truly just came here to ask for advice about finding a new therapist.

1578,d25c14,Request: I want help but don’t know where to start,"Hi guys,

I’ll try to keep this brief. About a year ago, in a bid to lose weight I started being “stricter” with my diet. Over time I gradually started restricting more and more and I developed strict rules about how much I was ate, what I ate, when I ate etc. At its worst it got very extreme, and I ate very little in a day. I don’t want to say it was anorexia because I can’t diagnose myself but I had pretty much all the textbook symptoms.  

Then it reached a point where I was finding it harder and harder to restrict what I was eating, so I started letting myself eat a bit more then making myself vomit afterwards. This lasted for about 2 months. At this stage I knew I had a real problem and I managed to basically just pull myself out of it, because I knew I was going to do serious damage if I didn’t. 

This is where the problem comes in. When I started eating again I went through a phase of extreme hunger. I ate absolutely anything and everything, whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I don’t eat such large amounts anymore but now I have a bit of a problem with chocolate and junk food. I let myself eat these in “recovery” because I didn’t want to restrict myself anymore, but now I don’t know where to draw the line with what I eat.

Most importantly, even though I am no longer starving/purging, I feel like I am still stuck in that mindset. I feel fat and I hate how much weight I have gained since I started eating again. I miss how powerful I felt when I didn’t eat and the compliments people used to give me when they saw how much weight I’d lost. It gave me self confidence which has been completely shattered. I feel like I’ve let myself go and I rarely leave the house anymore because I don’t want to be seen. I want to go to the gym and be fit and healthy but I’m scared I’ll end up with exercise bulimia. 

I’m trying to treat my own eating disorder but that’s never going to work. I really want to see a mental health professional but I’m scared they won’t help me since I don’t *technically* have an eating disorder anymore. I still have all the baggage that goes with it though and I don’t think I’ll ever be fully recovered unless I actually address these issues. When I went to the doctors about bad depression a few years ago they wouldn’t help me because I wasn’t suicidal, so I fear the same thing is just going to happen again.

1580,d1w76q,Request: Are these very early signs of an ED?,"[removed the clothing sizes from my previous request!]
Lately I've been:

1) standing a lot more in front of the mirror, not liking my belly bc I gained 10kg and it mainly shows around my waist, my pant size changed 2 sizes up. I'm far from being overweight but I really want my former size and belly back!!


2) extremely glad and relieved that I'm currently in rehab for 6 weeks (mental problems) bc it means getting served my meals so I can't really binge on unhealthy foods anymore, which is what I did this past year, hence the weight gain


3) eating my meals only until I'm not hungry anymore, I don't eat until I'm full, which leads to relatively small portions - and I'm kinda proud of that?!

4) feeling pretty guilty whenever I buy extra sweets from the cafeteria instead of only eating what's for dessert after lunch, even though I only buy 2 mars bars max, nothing more.

5) feeling guilty bc I've been eating a little bit of Nutella almost every morning for breakfast - planning on not doing that anymore


I'm a little worried since I have an addictive personality and since an ED is an addiction I feel like I have to be extra careful to not slip into this!

1581,d1w6g7,"Request: Does it ""count"" as an ED if im unconcerned with body image?","For the past 8 or 9 years I've struggled with motivating myself to eat, for various reasons, resulting in dangerously low BMI. I've sought help from my therapists and counselors who I've already been seeing for depression, but all of them have told me that I can't have anorexia or another eating disorder because my reasons for not eating aren't related to weight gain/body image. Is this accurate?

My thought process behind not eating is typically that I ""don't deserve it"" or that ""food is expensive"". My family was going through a lot of financial trouble around the time I stopped eating, so I've started seeing food as a waste of time and money, and going to the grocery store or even a restaurant gives me a lot of anxiety. Now I have stable income, but I still can't bring myself to spend more than the bare minimum on food, or even eat most of the food that I have without feelings of guilt and disgust. 

I've always been underweight and I've never had an issue with body image or tried losing weight/counting calories. Is that the only distinction between an eating disorder and other diagnoses like depression/anxiety?

Ever since last year I lost a significant amount of weight without exercise and it really freaks me out. I'm still losing weight to this day and my doctor's office is monitoring my weight everytime I go see my counselor/therapist for my anxiety issues.

My health anxiety is big. I freak out or panic when I try to eat certain things. I have safe foods (pizza, chicken, pasta, ice cream etc.) and everything else I'm extremely paranoid on. I really hate it, I don't want to think I'll get a disorder but my mom mentioned after her boyfriend seeing so much hair on my shirt that it could be due to my weight loss.

If I get below a certain weight my primary doctors will do something about my issues (possibly more doctors) and I'm kind of scared since I'm just near that point. I don't want to have disorders and I'm just... So mixed. My health anxiety messes with me so much about this and even before I ate perfectly fine I still had these issues, although I do admit I can't stomach too much food without issue.

I'm sorry for the long post. I've been so calm until now and I just really want comfort. Doctors scare me. Medicine scares me. Everything scares me so much and I just want a break from it.

My sister has admitted to having bulimia, but says it's temporary and doesn't think it's an issue.

She admitted to my parents a few weeks a go after breaking down. She doesn't know I know, my parents told me so I can be secretly supportive and watch what I say. She is early 20s and we believe it has gone on for around 6-8 months, although she says only 3. She has said it isn't a problem because it's only temporary and she will stop, but hasn't yet.. If she eats over a certain small number of calories in a day she makes herself sick.

Not sure if she is getting counseling, but after some reading up, we try to avoid any conversations about body size or weight, either positive or negative, and try to avoid discussing food, in that we avoid things like saying ""that's a big portion"" or ""this is a healthy/unhealthy meal.""

1593,d0ejcu,Request: Do you think I might have an ED?,"Hello, first time posting here. I am worried I might have (the beginnings of? tendencies toward?) an ED but am not sure and the FAQ didn't adequately address the specifics, hence this post.

First off, I've never been dx'd with an ED, but I also never have been evaluated for it. People have made note of my eating behaviors over the years but always had an excuse to explain it away: I'm just ""willowy"", I just have a ""lady's appetite"", and so on; I never even had to make my own excuses.

Most of my life I've hovered between the very low end of a healthy weight for my height and outright underweight, but it's hard to tell because my build/frame is ""naturally"" thin, angular, bony.

I have periods where I restrict food. I suppose that's the main thing. Sometimes I'll fast for days or longer. Sometimes these are just a result of anxiety or depression (both of which I am formally dx'd with); I do tend to lose my appetite when I'm stressed/depressed, but at some point it becomes intentional. I don't always count calories, but when I do I become very fixated on the numbers and I set unrealistic, brutal limits for myself that I will punish myself for if I dont meet them. Same for weight; I dont weigh myself regularly because I dont have access to a scale and am afraid of what habits I'll get into if I purchase one, but when my weight is taken I fixate on the number and am very critical of myself for it/am really only satisfied when it is below a certain threshold. And even when I'm not  doing so severely, I've found that I tend to maybe eat one real meal with others (so others ""see"") and not eat for the rest of the day. 

But I dont purge. And I dont think I really binge? I just have this restrictive behavior going on. And really, it's more about control than anything else. I have a tendency toward self-harm as well; both the restriction and the self-harm tend to be worst when I feel I do not have control over external circumstances affecting my life, or when I feel the need to exert self-discipline or self-punishment. (And I know this is not healthy; I'm currently between therapists.)

However, no one I talk to seems to think that my eating habits are serious enough to be considered an ED, and most criteria I've read specify that a preoccupation with body image or beauty standards is a defining factor in having an ED. But like I said, its mostly about control for me, it's never been about meeting beauty standards or feeling pretty. I have friends who struggled with EDs in their youth, were hospitalized for it, and such, and when I express my concerns that I might've crossed into ED territory at some point, they are dismissive (or even angry with me for ""appropriating their struggles"" or such), because I'm *currently* not significantly underweight or because its ""only"" a control thing and not a beauty thing, or because I dont also purge, and so on. 

So I'm getting really mixed signals about this. This pattern has been ongoing for about 10 years. In all that time, only one or two people ever expressed concern about my eating habits (including a high school teacher who made me eat a muffin in her classroom every day; and I get hella anxious when people try to force me to eat); most everyone else says if I didn't raise enough concern for a dx earlier then it's nothing serious. I'm afraid, though, because I can see this only getting worse in the future. I have definitely hurt myself by not eating: I've passed out more than once, I've had low levels of whatever they look for in the blood tests and had to take special vitamins and nutritional supplements, my BP has been low, and so forth. 

Does it sound like I might meet the criteria for an ED? Should I bring it up to my next therapist? Do I even have a right to speak in spaces like this sub, or am I blowing something that's normal way out of proportion?",1567763691,9/6/2019 4:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/d0ejcu/request_do_you_think_i_might_have_an_ed/,5

I don’t like myself. I am absolutely convinced that I am fat despite the fact that people are telling me I am thin.

I don’t want it to be like this but I like seeing myself getting skinnier. It’s so confused. I just can’t eat. Like literally. One bite and everything gets worse. I even feel that I should vomit. 

I saw my friends eating a cake and I started crying because of the food. It disgusts me. I feel dizzy all the time. I got some spots on the skin. I like seeing my bones coming out.

I’ve been struggling with an ED for a lot of my adult life, but it flared badly two years ago following the breakdown of a relationship. I lost a lot of weight in a few months as I convinced myself intermittent fasting and a very restricted diet, plus purging when I’d eaten too much or eaten what was probably a normal amount of food, was what would make me feel better. 

Since then, I’ve been trying to be better, and got into a good relationship, and better mental health, that has built my confidence. I’ve stopped weighing myself, but lately I’m being treated for a neurological disorder and the nurses weighed me (well, the nurse jokingly guessed what I was but then laughed when it was more than she guessed) for scans and I had a panic attack as I’d suddenly realised how I’d put a bunch of weight back on. I’ve obviously felt my clothes fit tighter, but now I’ve been weighing myself again and seeing how my weight is creeping up. It’s honestly broken me a bit, and I’ve found myself counting calories, restricting or occasionally purging again. I’m, medically speaking, a healthy weight but I feel completely awful in my body again and just want to be where I was before even though I know it’s at a cost.

If you’ve ever been to beauty school or know someone who has, you may know that the duffel bag you receive at the start of the program are giant and extremely heavy.

Every day someone will say to me “wow that bag is bigger than you” “that bag must weigh more than you.” My fellow students, my teachers, random staff from the school, everyone just keeps saying it to me and I GET IT.  I probably do look underweight despite body dysmorphia telling me I don’t.
In everyone’s defense, obviously no one at my school knows I have anorexia, I chose not to disclose it when I enrolled, and I have no interest in telling my classmates. I know it’s harmless and playful and a joke, and I can’t even explain why it triggers me as much as it does. I guess it makes me self aware and I start wondering if I look sick.

Now that I am a healthy weight ive noticed that my BP is still extremely low. I had to miss work today because i felt incredibly weak and ill and have been having intense headaches for a few days straight. When I went to the doctor he said that my BP was alarmingly low and that typically people with my BP are sent to the ER.

For 6 or 7 years, I have been using binging and purging as a way to cope with stress, especially stress from negative self-image - and I really wanted to put this to a stop. 

Plainly, my eating behaviours are mostly triggered by dissatisfaction to my body - I think I am too fat (to be attractive). I might have an ok relationship with myself otherwise (e.g. my looks, personality, achievements in life). Because of this, my counselor seems to think the solution for me is to lose weight, so that I will be satisfied with how my body looks.

I feel very uncomfortable with this, but I am not sure if it is (a) me being defensive and lazy about weight loss, or (b) her suggestion actually fails to address my problem, especially in terms of the cognition. On the other hand, from a physical health standpoint, I might benefit from losing some weight? I usually hover between 'normal' and 'overweight' from the BMI standpoint.

 i guess i just dont know if it is worth it to go back to treatment if i feel unmotivated to, even if i think i should. thoughts?",1568799220,9/18/2019 4:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/d5va50/request_is_worth_it_to_go_back_to_treatment_if_i/,2

And it's something that my mother has commented on all my life and just this evening I realized it might be something more?

Essentially, on a typical, normal day. I hate eating. Not because I want to lose weight, I just find the actual act of eating physically exhausting so I try and stick to liquid things to get sustenance.

But then someone will bring something into the house, and this switch will pop off in my head. And i have a horrible horrible compulsion to eat everything right that minute. My mom says i eat like an orphan kid, like I've had to fight for food all my life so when anything comes into the house i try and consume all/as much as I can before anyone else does. 

And that's it? The compulsion genuinely is this weird ""I need to eat all the new food now otherwise someone else will get it and something bad will happen""

It's irrational and dumb and idk how else to describe it.

My family isn't well financially so a lot of the times when I used to be hungry there really wasnt anything to eat. Over time I just stopped feeling hungry probably since my body adjusted to work with not eating as much.

I never really liked food that much except for certain meals that I rarely got to eat. I feel like I'm even more picky now in what I like to eat and can't really afford to get the foods we get now plus the ones I like. I started to use marijuana for other reasons and it also really helped my appetite. The problem is when I dont use it it makes me even less hungry but that only lasts a few days. 

That helped me gain weight but I'm not going to rely on it and can't use it all the time. I got sick a couple of months back with sepsis and was throwing up for days and hospitalized. After that it took me a few weeks to eat again but I feel as if my stomach is so sensitive now. Most foods I eat give me cramps which makes me want to avoid eating. I rarely feel my appetite and eating seems like a chore now. I still try my best to eat but I really need to be eating more for my health and energy.

1605,d59uvk,Request: Advice? Getting healthy &amp; fit without relapsing,"I have a history of restrictive eating, and was diagnosed with EDNOS a few years back. It's something that comes and goes episodically for me, with relapses typically caused by various triggers in my life as well as influenced by my depression, low self esteem, and body image/dysmorphia issues. Typically in the past I've gone several months or even a year or more between relapses.

Recently due to hormonal changes (entering my 20's, birth control, etc) I've gained quite a bit of weight, to the point of being medically overweight although not obese. I have a desire to take up exercising and more healthy eating, not just for appearance reasons, but also to have a healthier body and mind. I would like to have less body fat, more muscle mass, and more stamina and ability when doing sports/exercise, like running, biking, hiking, etc. I don't enjoy the limits my increased weight has put on me, from a funcionality perspective. I also think that healthier habits may positively impact my mental health overall.

I won't lie and say that changing my appearance and my unhappiness about looking overweight aren't motivations at all, though. And in the past when I've tried to eat healthier for the sake of weight loss/improving my appearance, I've accidentally fallen back into my old habits. ""Not eating when I'm not hungry (as in due to boredom or negative emotion)"" becomes ""I won't eat until I'm literally starving because I don't really NEED or deserve it until then"". I then end up even less healthy and feel physically like shit all the time.

I'm wondering if any of you have advice on how to actually become healthier while avoiding the trap of restricting my diet to extreme degrees. The last thing I want to do is relapse again, but sometimes the disordered part of my brain has different ideas.

""I'm can't eat even when I'm hungry"" 

I used to suffer from binging with occasional purging (mostly laxatives, rarely vomited). Now I think I'm at the other extreme. I dont eat. I mean I eat something every day but i know it's not an enough. I know im putting myself at all sorts of risks by not getting enough vitamins and nutrients and I know I'm losing weight. None of my clothes fit. My pants are getting baggy around the knees and thighs, you know the weird way it gets when you bend or sit down or walk too fast? I hate the rustling sound and folded look it makes and does. But long story short, I don't eat even when I'm hungry, I generally lack an appetite, and it ""hurts"" to swallow. Like it doesn't actually hurt but hurt feels like the right word. It's agonizing to swallow, feed myself, and feel full. I dont think I've truly been full in about a year, I just get to a point where it's too much emotional stress and mental stress to eat until fulfillment. 

I don't know what I'm looking for. I guess I just need to tell someone. I'd say I'm trying but I don't think that's honest. I'm just existing.",1568627426,9/16/2019 4:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/d4yfjg/request_post_for_me_please/,3
1607,d4yfi0,Request: (Would like to know if you would post this) Wondering if I had an eating disorder,"I want to preface this by saying I know most of you are not professionals and can't diagnose me, but I was just curious about something and I don't know where to go with it. About a year ago I used to frequently visit pro Ana websites. First it was out of morbid curiosity, then I just kept going to them, probably about daily. Despite how I was underweight, I started to use some of the ""tips"" on there (won't go into them)

I started working out more and more, and would always try to limit my food intake. I would look in the mirror and criticize my body, sometimes crying for hours after. The only reason I question if I actually had an eating disorder is that I never counted calories or purged or anything really extreme. I would usually cave after trying not to eat the whole day, didn't really weigh myself and after a few months I think I straightened myself out. 

I'm now making an effort to gain weight and I am trying to get out of the habit of just not eating when I don't want to. Though visiting pro Ana communities or seeing anything about them kind of triggers me in a way and it gives me the urge to revert back to what I used to do. About once every few months I admit I visit them.

I just don't know. How could I ""recover"" so quickly if I really had an Ed? I didn't talk to anyone about this and I just don't believe it really was anything, but whenever I tell people about it they say that it is obvious I did.",1568627416,9/16/2019 4:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/d4yfi0/request_would_like_to_know_if_you_would_post_this/,2
1608,d4yd4s,Request: My pre-ED adult BMI was pretty low. In recovery can I expect to go back to that place?,"So, I became sick with AN when I had already been an adult for quite a while. Before I got sick, just like the rest of my life and most of my family members, I used to maintain a pretty low (technically healthy, but still low) BMI without having the slightest issue with food whatsoever, never skipping meals and always eating intuitively.

Now that I am yet again underweight and experiencing a new relapse, with violent and frequent purging quickly becoming a ""staple"" of my ED, I realize that I absolutely have to do something before I damage my health beyond the point of no return. But the fear of weight gain and getting fat is overwhelming.

In my previous recovery attempts I did get back to a healthy-ish weight, but I never fully 100% restored to my pre-ED weight because I was just so scared. I was already out of the danger zone, my BMI wasn't low anymore and I was approaching my pre-ED weight, yet I was still experiencing extreme hunger so I freaked out.

Therefore: if I do try recovery for real, can I expect to get back to my pre-ED situation, or is it just my ED talking? Is it wishful thinking? Because I see so many people stating that it is unrealistic to maintain a low-ish BMI while recovering from an ED and that you have to get fatter than before because otherwise the thoughts will never go away. Many ""recovery spokepersons"" are embracing the HAES attitude.

Any ideas?

I did say hospital like 4 months ago but it didn’t work and I’m relapsing badly, and I faint like 4-5 times a week, I’m dizzy constantly, I had orthostatic hypotension when my GP measured my BP sitting and standing, i have asthma but it’s usually mild but I’ve had to use my rescue inhaler multiple times a day as I feel like I’m suffocating, I had to go to the ER for IV fluids due to hydration... the thing is, my BMI is just below underweight, and I hear that you need a BMI of 16 or less for inpatient (Canada), or if you don’t have that low a BMI but are medically compromised, you might need IP.

What is considered medically compromised/complicated? My bloodwork and ECGs are fine minus some sinus bradycardia which didn’t raise concerns, my electrolytes and such have always been fine.

1612,d4c5op,Request: How to stop focusing on the number on the scale after 10 years?," 

I’m 22F and and struggled with anorexia for 10 years. It started in middle school, and I have been counting and tracking everything I eat since then, and am very numbers-focused when it comes to calories and my weight. I was underweight in middle and high school and the beginning of undergrad, but toward the end of undergrad I started being on the border between underweight and normal. I started trying to gradually increase my calories my last year of college, and have continued trying to do that now (1st year of grad school).

I have made a significant increase (I think) and am continuing to get past what is comfortable every day. I have also recently been doing more strength training and weight lifting at the gym; I felt like I shouldn’t be doing so much cardio considering everything, and have always wanted more muscle but have been too afraid of the weight gain.

I weighed myself a couple weeks ago and weighed more than I have in years, and weighed myself again today and am back at what my highest ever weight has been. I’m sure it’s mostly because I’ve been doing so much with weights at the gym over the last few months and have increased my calories a bit, but I’m worried the number will ruin everything. I feel kind of okay with how I look, but I definitely have been feeling bigger and have been having more days where I am uncomfortable because I feel like it’s noticeable. I know that if I want my body to look the way I want and to gain muscle, then I will gain weight, but actually seeing how much I’ve gained makes me want to stop eating and stop doing strength workouts entirely.

I try not to weigh myself often - I don’t have a scale at home or anything, but I can’t help but use them if I’m in a doctors office or a store that has one. If I don’t actually weigh myself then I’ll just convince myself that my weight must have gone up and will feel the urge to restrict.

I obviously want to stay on track with my recovery and it’s been going pretty well I think, but now that there are actual changes that I’m seeing and I’m aware of my actual weight, I’m really concerned that I’ll end up going back to what I’ve been doing the last 10 years.

1615,d4c38z,Request: Introducing exercise with ED recovery,"Some background: my sister has had annorexia and many OCD traits surrounding her food habits for many years. A couple of years ago things suddenly started to get much better in many ways when she started a college course and found that living and thriving in life in other ways allowed her to let go of some of her restrictions around food. It's been such a wonderful relief. Before that she had spent years not doing very much having left school at 15 and only ever staying in jobs for short periods of time. During that time, we were trying to make progress with her ED with therapists and support groups. It is incredible how finding something she enjoyed in life had such a greater effect on her making progress with her ED than any quantity of therapy seemed to be able to when she was otherwise disengaged. 


Fastforward to now: I am concerned because she has started to lose weight again rapidly in the past few months. She won't tell me she is doing it, but I know she has started running or going to the gym at least everyday, sometimes more. She still eats limited quantities and varieties of food, including no carbohydrates and, as she loses weight, all I can see is that she is damanging herself again. She is much lower energy, sleeping a lot more like she used to and I know that doing exercise, cardio in particular can only be causing her body more harm than good, and I worry about her mental health as this may be the start of developing a new obsessive habit. I know that she wants to be 'fit and healthy' and I think she thinks it is doing her good. Sometimes she will open up and talk with me honestly, but she gets very evasive when I ask about her exercising. Generally she is open to listen learn improve if presented with good info and the right approach from me - which I only sometimes get right. 


Questions:

1. Is this harmful for her or am I overreacting? If so, how so exactly?

2. Where can I read more about how to safely and healthily introduce exercise with ED recovery? Also about the effects of excercise when you do not have sufficient energy and nutrient intake. 


 It is tricky because:

1. Quite a lot of our family and friends are sporty, runners in particular so often conversations about activeness and related wellbeing come up. It's difficult to also emphasise, the benefits come along with a well balanced diet so may actually not be universally beneficial. 

2. As she left school early, she was never taught the basic biochem of food, nutrition, exercise fundamentals. I think that she lacks knowledge about how this whole system works. 

3. We would likely need to get professional advice privately, which she/I am currently not willing/able to afford. 


Any help with the questions above, recommended reading, general advice on how to approach this or any similar positive experience with similar situations would be very welcome.

1620,d3rumr,Request: I want to get better," 

My bulimia started when I was 14, now at 18 I wish I was ‘over it’. I’m not okay, very depressed and engaging in the cycle of bping worsens my mental state, which makes me b/p more. As a form of self harm/repent I don’t do things after I b/p, I don’t do my homework, I don’t tidy my room, I don’t wash myself or my clothes and recently I’ve realised that i can’t function in everyday life anymore without thinking “I want to die”. I hate that thought, because I don’t actually want to die, it’s just an intrusive thought that makes me more depressed.

A few months ago I told a close friend what was going on, she was understanding, listened to me and so on. She really helped me, but the thing about being depressed, is that I’ve stopped wanting to leave the house on the weekends, do activities with friends or even just go on a walk; I’ve stopped living. Because of me our friendship has weakened, leaving me feeling abandoned, even though it’s not like that.

A week ago I told my mother, one evening when I was feeling very unstable and turned my moment of weakness into a moment of strength. My mother’s words of wisdom were “at least it’s not anorexia” and “wait, you want to see someone about this?”

Her reaction deeply disappointed me, but she’s looking for specialised therapists for me, so I’ll receive help soon.

I told her I want to be open about my issue and want to tell my little sister about what I’m going through. Something I’ve not managed to do yet, because I’m scared.

In the meantime I’ve told another friend of mine who is very invested in my mental health, which has really helped me, but at the end of the day, she isn’t my therapist and I don’t want to turn our relationship into one where we only talk about my problems.

I know telling more people will help me get better, but I’m scared that if I tell my all my friends, it will become something akin to ‘common knowledge’ and I don’t know how to feel about that.

Currently I’m getting better by tracking my calories, which isn’t ideal, but if I don’t, then I lose my sense of structure and fall into a b/p cycle for a few days. I’m also focusing on improving in the gym, because sport is good for mental health. Because my main lowlights are on weekends when I’m alone, I’ve joined an organisation committee in my school and am not letting myself not do my homework as a strange repent for binging. I’m focusing on keeping my days consistent and structured, because otherwise I feel like I’m in a free fall, the carpet pulled out from under me.

I know that Reddit isn't a doctor/therapist but I could do with some input. I'm very confused as to whether or not I have a problem and whether or not this problem is am eating disorder or disordered eating. 

I've had trouble (I think) with food for a few years now but on and off, and this trouble seems to return more viciously but disguised as something else every time. Sometimes I have a lot of trouble with bingeing, sometimes I restrict, sometimes I purge through exercise. My mental symptoms seem to change a lot as well: sometimes I feel crazy guilt after eating, sometimes I panic, sometimes I feel calm but also very driven to get my calorie balance down to a comfortable range (e.g. by skipping a meal or exercising). It can be very competitive too: if I hear other people's stories I feel like mine isn't enough (?) and like I haven't earned any help. I'm also terrified that, if I go to a Dr and it turns out I really am just being dramatic, I'll feel so guilty and like I need to be a better ED patient (?). Idk, it's all a bit weird and all over the place.

Written out, it sounds very clear but I think the fact that it keeps changing and my symptoms aren't always present at the same time or at all makes me think it's not real. Every so often the reality of my actions hits home and I panic and want to talk to someone. But every time I psyche myself up for this it's like the symptoms lessen or disappear. I feel almost euphoric happiness all of a sudden and guilty for having faked it all and like I'd be stupid to stop now when there's no actual problem. It's like it's backing off only to seduce me back even harder in a few weeks down the line.

The thing is, it's never become really serious - I've never been diagnosed, never been hospitalised, only occasionally have I been underweight with it and only sometimes do people express their concern. I'd feel like a poser if I got a diagnosis. Recently, I've been restricting and I'm trying to recover at the moment but it's like I've forgotten how. I keep making the same choices and doing the same things but with thoughts in my mind telling me that I've kicked it. Is this genuinely me recovering or just an ED trying to convince me it's no issue?

Basically, there's a lot going on (some of which I haven't mentioned because this is already an essay) and I don't know what is rational and what isn't. Even now, reading back over this, I feel like I'd just be dismissed and that it's not real. I can't tell if I really am just being a drama queen or if that's a sneaky ED just trying to cling on. 

Thanks in advance for any help given!",1568392485,9/13/2019 11:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/d3rucr/request_very_confused/,1
1622,d938zv,Request: Need temporary advice to manage BED/BN (until specialist appointment),"Hello,

I'm feeling desperate for advice today. Long story short I've had disordered eating since I was a sophomore in high school and I am in my mid 20s now. I've had periods of just binging, purging also, restriction, a combination of the three, and there has been some years where my disordered eating was pretty mild. The past year binging has been bad, and my method of purging has been abusing laxatives, which makes me rather sad because I can see how its taking a toll on my health. 

I'm gaining weight and as you can imagine this upsetting for me. This has partially to do with my efforts of making sure I'm eating enough throughout the day to lessen the urge to binge at night-but I'm still binging with my new habit of breakfast and a ""normal"" sized lunch. 

I have no control and I hate it. Someone please help me find control. No one I disclose this to really sees the gravity of the issue in my eyes, possibly because I'm in an average size body. 

A few other relevant things is I have an appointment in a couple weeks with a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. I have my skepticism about this because I know I dont emotional eat, its 100% out of habit. I'm also a dietitian so I am an expert with nutrition, but this isnt an issue of nutrition, it's an issue of behavior. I also ordered the book brain over binge...but it's in the mail. 

Does anyone have any help for me to atleast get me through the day/next couple weeks?

1624,d90x1s,Request: “i wish i had your eating disorder”,"this is something that a couple of my friends have said to me. and it pisses me off to no end. 

ive dealt with almost every eating disorder since i was a pre-teen. it all began with me binge eating, which led to me gaining my weight and getting an extreme amount of self hatred and body dysmorphia. then that turned into bulimia. ive gone through phases of obsessively counting calories, purposely starving myself, and just generally having an awful relationship with food. ive gained and lost weight countless times, many times in a short period of time. and right now i guess i would be considered anorexic. so ive kind of been through it all. 

two of my friends are self diagnosed binge eaters. one of them i completely believe, she goes to therapy (pretty sure she’s diagnosed) and we’ve talked about our relationship with food before. the other one however seems to just generally eat too much because she likes food and occasionally uses the label. im not trying to say she doesn’t have any issues with food, it just seems like she throws around the label of an eating disorder very loosely. 

anyways, both of these friends have made comments before about “i wish i had that eating disorder” and “haha i got the wrong eating disorder” and especially “we get it. youre skinny”. and it really fucking sucks. like ive had years of obsessing over every bite of food that goes into my body. most of the time i cant even enjoy food. and they act like they’re jealous of it.

1633,d8c6o2,Request: Crazy hormonal symptoms," 

Hi all, I’m posting this really just for some support and reassurance that my situation will get better. I first got diagnosed with anorexia when I was 12, I’m now almost 21. I’ve been in and out of treatment throughout the years, it’s a constant battle but for the past while I have maintained a borderline healthy weight and had been doing okay! Back in July I got the nexplanon implant as I needed to come off the combined pill due to my migraines. I was fine for the first week, but from the second week I started experiencing a lot of symptoms including: total loss of appetite yet weight gain in spite of this, bloating, constipation, hair loss, depression and indescribable fatigue. I tried to let things settle for a while but they only got worse, and I got the implant out after only a month. However my symptoms did not improve, fast forward now to September and if anything they have gotten worse. I’ve gained over a stone despite eating a very low amount calories a day due to my lack of appetite. Since a lot of my symptoms are similar to hypothyroidism, Ive had a few blood tests - the first came back as subclinical hypothyroidism but when they tested again my thyroid hormones were normal. I keep telling myself that maybe this is all just due to a huge hormonal upset from the implant and that it’ll pass but it’s been 3 months now and it’s so so difficult. I feel like I can’t describe the mental distress that this weight gain is causing me. I’m truly miserable. The only good thing that has come from this is that I feel it has given me true perspective on my eating disorder and (probably for the first time since I was 12) I am fully willing and committed to maintaining a BMI in the healthy range once this is all over and I’m back to my normal self. Thank you to anyone who is still reading, this has turned into a very long post hahaha I just want this all to be over, if anyone has any advice/similar experience I would be so grateful.",1569269604,9/23/2019 15:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/d8c6o2/request_crazy_hormonal_symptoms/,9
1634,d6ss3d,Request: 11-14M Reflecting,"I’ve been recovered for about five years now, and as a teenage boy who was encouraged to move on and was ashamed of himself, I rarely think of it. I had anorexia from 11 to 14 and have always been interested in how I developed an ED. I came from a typical suburban upper-middle class family with two parents and a sibling. I was a smart, fairly introverted and composed boy who loved sports. As I developed anorexia, I began to lose weight at an age where boys typically gain 10+ pounds a year. This greatly diminished my athletic abilities at the time, and my growth was stunted as well. 

I began getting help at a pretty early stage, and kept my eating disorder to my family in those three years. I already was a “late bloomer” before I developed anorexia, so I’m not sure if my extreme delay in growth was entirely due to the eating disorder, or not. Between 11-14 I only grew a couple of inches and stayed, if not lost, weight. I  I hit a massive growth spurt at about 16, and grew 8 inches in a matter of 16 months while gaining a proportionate amount of weight. 

Some effects of my mental illness still linger on in my life. I have low self-confidence and often worry too much in social settings. 

I’m interested in learning more about how I could have possibly developed an eating disorder at this age (I understand there are biological factors). I’m also curious as to whether or not my delayed growth was due to the eating disorder or not. 

Primarily, the most interesting factor of this eating disorder to me is what it implies about myself. Are there any implications as to how this may effect a recovered teenage boy’s future? Possible tendencies? Characteristics? Personality?",1568974329,9/20/2019 5:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/d6ss3d/request_1114m_reflecting/,3

1642,dc82ol,"Request: Restricting by weight of food and drink, not calories","Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I need some help on a topic that has been troubling me for years but I've not had the confidence to seek help about it entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

Five years ago, my eating became disordered. What started as depriving myself of calories to lose a little bit of weight for an upcoming holiday eventually turned in to dealing with Anorexia Nervosa.

&amp;#x200B;

Within the following three years and a lot of counselling and cognitive behaviour therapy later, I gained back an acceptable amount of weight and landed within the healthy BMI range.

&amp;#x200B;

That was two years ago now. Since then, although my weight has remained near enough the same, it has been incredibly difficult to maintain it and doing so takes up a huge amount of my time, energy and mental capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, my eating is still disordered. However, it is disordered in a way that despite hours of searching across countless internet platforms and medical journals, nobody else has ever recorded undergoing. And that's why I am so scared.

&amp;#x200B;

It's going to sound crazy, but please hear me out and take me seriously. I have lived this way for two and a half years now, and need/would appreciate all of the advice I can get.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I control my weight is not through calorie intake and calorie counting, but by the mass of the food I consume.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 25 months, I have been limiting myself to a small total weight of food and drink per day. So every day, my total total intake of physical weight of food and drink combined equals that weight.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, I weigh X lbs on a morning on an empty stomach, naked and after using the toilet. At the end of the day, after eating and drinking, I weigh X lbs plus the weight of the food I allowed myself under the same conditions (naked and after using the bathroom). 

&amp;#x200B;

The calorie total does not matter to me. I could consume that weight of lettuce and water or that weight of fudge cake and cola. What matters is that I do not surpress the limit of physical food weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this makes sense up to now.

&amp;#x200B;

This is because when my body starves during the night the through my sleep cycle, those eight hours are spent actually physically breaking down and digesting the added weight of food/drink I have put in to my body, as well as absorbing the calories.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have noticed is that if I consume \*more\* than X lbs of food and drink per day, my body will still only weigh X pounds less the following morning after sleeping (and therefore starving) during the night.

This would make no difference if the food and drink were calorie dense or deficient. What matters is the physical mass, poundage and volume of what I'm consuming and not the calories it contains.

&amp;#x200B;

This concept is crazy I know, and I've never heard of anyone else living a life of disordered eating this way. I have tried to explain my ways of eating to a close family friend, my mother and my therapist, but they simply cannot comprehend where I am coming from despite years of me living this way. It's driving me insane and I am desperate for help.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to eat a normal diet and ultimately live a normal life. That is all I want. It's all I desperately long for. I want it so bad, a life that does not revolve around weighing myself up to 10 times throughout one given day to make sure I'm no more than X lbs heavier in mass due to the food and drink I have consumed. It's driving me insane to live this way.

&amp;#x200B;

Please, if anyone has any advice I would appreciate it. I'm scared to explain myself to the doctor, as I know what I'm trying to explain sounds beyond crazy and against the actual science of weight gain (which is otherwise totally dependent upon calories in vs calories out).

&amp;#x200B;

My weight was once balanced no matter the volume of food and drink consumed and was maintained by my calorie intake. I do not understand why this has changed with me, even despite undergoing Anorexia.

This is a mix of (potential ED?) and other things but I just can't handle this anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother, is a fantastic mother, but I am morbidly obese, and have been so since high school, and she doesn't know how to cook for 2 people. Only a full family. Ever since my dad died she has only had myself and her. She has a PLETHORA of health issues and barely eats anything. I can cook, but don't often as it makes me feel gross or I end up making dinner for us, and she doesn't eat. (Or i cook like her and make enough for a family of 3 or 4)

&amp;#x200B;

I have an issue(s) of eating nothing until I feel like passing out, bored eating, stress eating, binge eating, depressed/emotional eating, purging after eating, all of the eating issues. I used to and sometimes still do, view food as a reward when I do certain things. Other times I use food as what it is, just to keep me from passing out and staying somewhat alive. Other times I just want to puke thinking about food.

99% of the time, nothing sounds good food wise and I feel sick thinking about eating. When I can eat, often times its unhealthy because of my stomach issues and eating healthy makes my stomach/bowel issues flare up.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this brings me to the issue my mom and I have. Example, tonight..she made fried chicken, homemade mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. I grabbed one large piece of chicken, a bunch of sprouts and a fair amount of potatoes. I ate very little chicken , but everything else, and shes giving me hell for not eating all of my food. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told her, i need to stop eating when im full and she interrupted me mid sentence saying ""i know what youre about to say, you always say it"" and im upset and feel like i want to throw up everything and hurt myself (selfharm via the standard method y'all may be familiar with)

&amp;#x200B;

I straight up told her earlier, my health issues, mostly my weight, are stressing me out. I have an EMG on the 15th and i already know what they're gonna say. She says if it ends up involving surgery they wont operate cause im too fat. I cant lose weight. Ive tried. Every fucking way i can think of and it always comes back and then some. Also, you cant exercise like you want to when youre in too much pain to even walk.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her i legitimately will just kill myself if this continues because I cant handle it anymore. She tells me to shut the fuck up and i retort with she doesnt understand. She says she does she used to be obese. Im like WHOOP DEE FUCKING DOO! IM EVEN MORE SO IM GONNA DIE! Add that plus mental illness being untreated because i cant find something affordable and I have a full time job, no you DONT fucking understand and you're making it SO MUCH WORSE.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thats a long winded summary of whats happening and rn i just want to throw up. Im so sick to my stomach.

1646,dc3rsc,Request: Self harm to disordered eating," 

Hi all! I'm new here.

Between 13/14 and 22 years old I struggled with SH. The worst years were 17 to 20, where I was hospitalized multiple times and on lots of meds. I've been cut free since 2013, and even when I've thought of doing it I've not. Go me!

However, I don't think it's any coincidence that about six months after stopping with SH I discovered alcohol at 23. I'm not an alcoholic by any stretch, but I definitely drink more than is recommended.

I also started self soothing with food, and began baking as a major hobby. Whenever I feel crap I eat a sweet. It definitely stopped me from SH, buuuut since 2015 I've gained 20 pounds. (Some of that is muscle from training to black belt in martial arts, but a lot of it is excess fat). Now I'm stuck in an endless loop of eating junk and feeling guilty. I can't even look at myself in the mirror anymore because  I feel disgusted by myself.

It's dawned on me my therapy never tackled the underlying symptoms of my SH, just the symptoms. I obviously still have the emotional issues, but I've just swapped SH with disordered eating. Sometimes I imagine just slicing off all the fat rolls and putting them in the bin.

I would seek therapy, but public healthcare in my country is horrific, and I can't afford private health care: a counsellor is €100 an hour, and they don't normally specialize in this stuff.

Has anyone else had the same experience?",1569981850,10/1/2019 21:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dc3rsc/request_self_harm_to_disordered_eating/,1
1647,dc3pap,Request: Post request - my stubbornness is causing problems.,"I have always had problems with disordered eating, most recently at the start of 2018 after a relationship breakdown I stopped eating properly, buying a pack of 7 chicken wings from work every Monday and that was it for the week. This went on for roughly 8 months. 

I’ve been okay and eating sensibly since, and have put on weight. I’ve gone a bit heavier than I would like, so have started dieting again, trying to be sensible. 

My family and close friends are worried about this. I’m not, I feel like I’m in control of it and I’m not counting calories. But every time someone tells me I need to “eat properly” or “just have dessert/fries/whatever” I can feel myself buckling down internally. I refuse what they offer me, what they suggest. Assure them I’m fine. If they ever insist and make me have something, I purge it as if to prove a point. 

I can feel myself spiralling quite quickly because of being stubborn, and I don’t know how to deal with it. I don’t want to involve my GP unless I absolutely have to. I know everyone is just trying to help but the pressure is driving me mad. 

Any advice or suggestions are appreciated.",1569981515,10/1/2019 20:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dc3pap/request_post_request_my_stubbornness_is_causing/,1

I have been clinically diagnosed with OCD and Body Dysmorphia, but I am unsure if my eating habits are dangerous enough to be considered a clinical disorder. 

For the past three years of being in college I have established the routine of never eating throughout the day and then having a small dinner. I drink plenty of water and will occasionally have an apple for a midday snack but other than that I only eat a modest dinner. My diet consists mostly of carbs and there are days I don’t even eat one full meal. When I can last an entire day without eating I feel validated and as if I did something good. I have gotten so used to this that I rarely get hungry but I do have weak strength and get winded if I have to walk uphill.

1652,db9beg,Request: I think I might have an eating disorder. I could really use some outside perspective and advice," 

I've always been extremely insecure in my own body despite being at average/healthy weights for most of my life. However, it's not just my relationship with myself that I feel might be unhealthy, but my relationship with food as well.

I document every single thing I eat so I can know the exact calories I've consumed (I limit it strictly to a low level). I skip meals and lie about it. I hate eating in front of other people and if anyone makes any comments about the way I'm eating or how much I'm eating it makes me self conscious and I immediately want to stop eating and I won't eat anything else from that point on. It upsets me greatly when people push me to eat, even when it's out of concern. If I lose control and eat something I shouldn't or eat too much I will likely cry and be depressed about it for days and heavily restrict in those following days. I hide food (especially when it's a meal thats been left out for me) to pretend like I've eaten it and then dispose of it when I can.

No one knows I've been doing this. If my family knew they would be extremely angry and I'd be punished and forced into constantly over eatingin front of them until they're satisfied (they've done it before). I've thought of reaching out to my bf but I don't want him to be worried or disappointed in me.

I dont know what to do. I just want to keep losing weight until I'm happy but I can't seem to do it in a healthy way and this is making me miserable.",1569837925,9/30/2019 5:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/db9beg/request_i_think_i_might_have_an_eating_disorder_i/,1
1653,db99df,"Request: I need to be admitted to an inpatient clinic, but I have a full time job. How do I tell my employer?","I've finally accepted that I need professional, specialized help. I've been seeing a therapist for a while, and we both agree that entering an inpatient programme would be the best option for me.

Unfortunately, I'm in a pickle because it doesn't feel like the right time, due to my work. But realistically, it's never going to be the right time. I work in a very small team of 3 people - my boss, my supervisor, and myself. We are hopefully hiring 2 new interns in January. Because we are such a small team, we each have a mountain of responsibilities, and I know our business will struggle tremendously if I am gone for 1 - 3 months. For the rest of the year, we are very much swamped with client work, but things tend to be very quiet in the beginning of the year, so I'm thinking of waiting until next year to actually enter the programme.

My question is, how do I approach this issue with my boss in a professional manner. I love my work, and my boss is very understanding - perhaps almost fatherly. He does not know about my situation (my supervisor does), but I know it will hit him quite hard too, because we often joke about my eating habits in the office and I know he could feel guilty, in a way. 

Basically, I don't know how to tell my boss that I essentially need to go on leave for 1 to 3 months. I'm terrified that it will jeopardize my job, and I'm also unsure of how specific I need to be. Would saying I need leave for health reasons be enough? Or do I own up and tell him I'm bulimic and need professional help, and that would (hopefully) be taken more seriously?

If anyone else has had any experiences about giving up other commitments for entering a clinic, please share! I'm completely lost on this. Thanks.",1569837576,9/30/2019 4:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/db99df/request_i_need_to_be_admitted_to_an_inpatient/,6
1654,db99b7,Request: How do i talk to my parents about my eating disorder?,"Obligatory first post, typed on mobile. Posted on a throwaway on the off chance anybody i know uses reddit. i haven’t the best grammar and my autocaps isn’t on, so apologies in advance. 

Around christmas 2017, i began developing what i think is an eating disorder ( i never got it diagnosed and i don’t wanna be the kind of person who self diagnoses, but for the purpose of this post, i’ll call it an eating disorder). i would stop getting out of bed to eat over the christmas holidays, and as a result i would just go all day with only eating very small amounts, for days in a row. 

Initially, my motivation was not because of insecurity, or because i wanted to lose weight, it was simply laziness. however, after a while, and id gone back to school, i stopped having breakfast, usually left most if not all of my lunch, and barely touched my dinner. it was around this point where my motivations changed, and i was pleased when i noticed i was getting skinnier (although i wasn’t fat to begin with). any food i did eat was junk food and crap, meaning i had no energy. this took a real physical toll on me, to the point where i would feel so weak that i’d have to lean on chairs and tables when i was standing up, because i was scared i didn’t have the strength to stand by myself. i tried to convince myself i wasn’t hungry, when in reality i was starving, but didn’t want to admit to myself that i had a problem. i was seriously in denial.

this was made worse by the fact that i had gotten physically skinnier. i was already a pretty slim person naturally, so this meant that people noticed how thin i had gotten. i began to be picked on because of this. it was never too extreme, just a few comments from a few people, but it was enough to make my already weak self esteem plummet. i got to a really low point, but thankfully i had an amazing boyfriend and friends who helped me.

in the last couple months i am much better, i eat breakfast every morning, which is something i didn’t do beforehand. i eat all my lunch and dinner, and usually even another small meal before bed. however recently the bad, self destructive thoughts have been coming into my mind again. even though i know i haven’t changed much in appearance, i feel horrible anytime i look in the mirror. although i haven’t fallen back into my old eating habits yet, my confidence has seriously been hurt, and i’m worried that i will go back to how i was. i really want to get proper help before it gets really bad, but i have no idea how to talk to my parents about this. 

note: they are usually pretty open-minded when it comes to things like mental health, but i’ve never talked to them about anything like this before, and as i’m still eating normally, i’m worries that they’ll think i’m putting it on for attention. does anybody have any advice on how to talk to them ?

These side affects scare me and make me afraid that I'm gonna die in my sleep or something, I know that's probably irrational but I'm wondering how worried I should be.

I keep making excuses for myself by saying that I am fine, because I am not underweight. I am still a ""healthy weight"" by BMI standards but I have these symptoms which scare me.

If you already suffered anorexia once, does that mean the effects will be more severe if you relapse? I do plan to go to an ED therapist next week but I'm scared for myself.

I’m also scared I don’t look sick enough. I’ve always been relatively thin but I’m not underweight. Teetering on the edge of it but not quite there. I almost feel like I need to prove my disorder to him. 

This is all new to me. Basically nobody has ever known about my eating disorder in the 5 years it’s been going on, and when my parents found out when I lived at home nothing happened. Being thin is the ultimate goal for a woman’s appearance in my family.

I want to maybe try going back to the gym and building up my muscle, but I don't think I can make myself eat enough to have a caloric surplus so that I won't lose even more weight. But the idea of putting on more weight and not being this lean anymore terrifies me. I don't know if its worth it for me to try and just become happy where I am right now and work towards a healthier body later, try going to the gym and putting on more muscle, or attempting to gain more weight before I undertake physical activity.

I am 5'6"" and fluctuate in the few pounds on the border of normal and overweight BMI range. I am pretty muscular from Martial arts, but most of my weight comes from what I perceive to be ""excess fat"".

I've tried dieting so many times: I went through a phase of exercising for at least an hour daily and reduced my calories significantly. I did this for months on end, but only shifted a few pounds after calorie counting and controlling portions every minute of everyday. I logged even the 0% milk I put in my tea.

Am I just gonna have to accept that this is the body type I'm supposed to be? Am I always gonna be a bit ""chunky""? Should I stop punishing myself for being a bit bigger?

I spent my whole childhood being told by my Mum I needed to lose weight, but I was never clinically overweight, so I'm worried I'm just carrying my mum's judgment with me everywhere. HOWEVER, I am clinically overweight as an adult.

Am I overthinking this? Should I give myself a rest, or is losing weight something that would actually be good for my body? And if weight loss is what my body needs, why can't I lose it?

I’ve had exercise/restriction-induced amenorrhea for almost 8 months now, and got a nutritionist meal plan at the end of August after finally admitting my problem to my family. Prior to this I significantly restricted my diet in order to lose weight even though I hit the edge of the underweight bmi range. 

My meal plan gives me a moderately increased amount of calories to increase my weight slowly. In all honesty, after starting college again in september I didn’t meet this number consistently because I was stubborn (and still kind of am). 

This week, I went home and ate abundantly since my family cooked a lot for me, and my mom sent me a ton of snacks and food for college. Compared to the past month, I’ve found myself so much hungrier and ate a ton of snacks yesterday. I’m feeling horribly guilt even though I know food is my medicine and that I need to do better in terms of gaining weight.

I guess I just need someone to sympathize with in terms of food guilt/extreme hunger. I know this is all normal but I’m trapped between wanting to get better and stop worrying about my period and get back to running, but also not wanting to lose my figure that I’ve worked so hard on for the past year.

So obviously I don't want to count calories or deny myself any food groups, and with exercise I'd just eat back the calories I burned.

My father has been through a lot and my mother, who started all the past problems, had anorexia. I really hate purging and lately I've been getting pains at my sides. My dad got me meds for constipation which started me on laxatives as well. No one knows of my ED. I'm too afraid to tell anyone. My family is VERY strict, but I kind of feel like they where the ones who started it. I only wanted to lose weight at the start but they kept forcing me to eat, so I started purging. If they just left me alone I feel like I could fix my self. I know it's to late now...if they left me now, I would never eat. 

The days I get away from eating I get this feeling of power. I feel taller and leaner. Theres just this feeling when I'm comfortable in my clothes and being able to ignore the digging in my stomach. 

I really want to tell someone, but I have judgemental friends and I do not want to tell my dad. I can say that he has picked up on my obsession with weight.

1677,denx42,Request: I feel like a fake.,"My eating issues developed around a year or so ago, and it was at its worse around the midpoint of last year. I only sought help for it this year and was diagnosed with atypical anorexia but I feel like I'm a fake and I don't really have one anymore. 

I think the main reason why I feel like a fake is because I get anxious and feel like I have to lose weight before my next doctor's appointment. Thus, my motivation for losing weight is partially due to the fact that I feel like I have to ""proof"" that I have an ED because of a drop in my weight.

I don't really know what's a binge and what's normal eating anymore because I used to do heavy restricting and now I just eat whatever I want, whether I'm hungry or not, as long as I have an urge to. This usually results in large intakes of food that I consider a binge.

I know that restrictive eating can turn to binging very quickly and vice versa, but what if my idea of a binge is just how a normal person eats and I no longer have an ED? I feel like a fraud and I feel guilty when I see the doctor because I'm a patient whose condition seems less severe or even non-existent as compared to other patients.",1570474625,10/7/2019 13:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/denx42/request_i_feel_like_a_fake/,6

1692,dipcea,Request: Making exercise less triggering while still not fully recovered from bulimia,"  

I (F17) have had disordered eating since childhood, which at that time was my mothers fault. Later, (age 10) I was restricting, but as I moved to a different country (age 13-15) my restrictive habits have gotten much more extreme and I have reached my a very low BMI. I was constantly either restricting and over exercising or binging/purging and, again, overexercising. It came to the point where I would throw up almost everyday and exercised 2-3 times a day for about an hour per session. The school tried to make me get diagnosed and treated, but I didn’t want to recover from it, because although I looked tired and sick (especially from severe anemia), my cognitive function was not affected. After a few meetings with therapist my mother refused to bring me there, as it was too much effort and too expensive.

I never admitted to having any issues and denied it til the end, so I never got the diagnosis. In year 12-13 I have to go to gym sessions every week. Last year I went only a few times and it triggered my compulsive exercise lasting about a week each time. So, I would exercise at night for 2 hours and had trouble eating. I stopped attending the session and got a low grade because of it, but I felt justified, as I was in recovery.

I am still in recovery, but I thought it would be much easier on me this year and that I could participate. I found that the things that most triggers me is being observed when eating or exercising. I have an alternative to eating: not going to lunch and bringing my own food, which is much healthier and tastier. However, after numerous timetable changes I learned that I will not be able to have PE sessions with my friends and will have to do them with strangers instead. I already missed about 6 sessions since the beginning of school, I decided to go to the therapist for the first time to fix this and many other mental issues of mine, but the school is pressuring me into doing these sessions, mainly because last year I didn’t attend them, even though I have lots of time to do it. I have to go there next Tuesday and this week we have a sports day. I have to do it next week, but I don’t know how to not get triggered again. Thinking about it alone makes me want to starve and exercise to the point of getting to LW again, just out of anger at school, but also because my self-esteem is at its lowest ever right now.

I obviously have spoken to my doctor at length about it, and I have been making sure I see the same doctor consistently to make sure, she has the best idea of what is wrong with me and how to treat my issues. She has referred me off to a eating disorder clinic, but she isn’t quite sure if it considered an eating disorder because I’m not fasting because I’m trying to loose weight or anything - I just cannot even force myself to eat. 

I’m not asking for a diagnosis at all, because I know I can’t get that through a reddit post but I would love to hear people’s opinions and advice on what they think of me situation. 

Thanks in advance.",1571232555,10/16/2019 8:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dipc26/request_help_with_ed/,1
1694,dipbzk,Request: title: living with a friend with anorexia,"Tldr at the bottom.

I don't have an eating disorder, but I've become close with a girl who has anorexia. It might be a little too late in the situation for me to get advice, but I don't see how it can hurt.

First off, I'm thin. I eat when I'm hungry, and don't avoid it, other than the odd occasion when I feel too lazy or low to cook. Even then, I tend to fill up on snacks. I eat what I want, when I want. I've always been small, and my whole family is the same. My whole life I've been like this and I don't think I could change my body type if I wanted to.

However, it seems to be a real problem for my friend. We're 2nd year uni students and have just moved into a house together. She monitors what everyone in the house eats, and often says things like ""why should I stick to a diet plan when no one in the house eats enough?"" But she simply doesn't see everything everyone eats. She's not always there when I get food from the kitchen, so the amount she thinks I eat is probably half that of the reality.

She has multiple therapists and a dietitian that her parents are paying for. Anorexia is also not her only mental health problem, but this is where it's become a problem for me. A few weeks ago she absolutely lost it at me, and said some things that, for my own person reasons, really hit me hard and have been a struggle for me to wrap my head around. The main thing she said was ""I've had to go around and tell all my therapists I can't get better with my best friend (ie me) around. Do you know how hard that is for me?"" She then went on to talk about how unhealthy she thinks I am, and finished with ""if you care about me at all you'll go and see a doctor and get a full blood count done"".

I don't think this was acceptable at all, regardless of how it made me feel. Even if she hadn't managed to hit some of my most tender nerves during her rant (some other things she said really got to me as well but they aren't quite relevent to the post) no one should have to hear that from their friend. I know EDs aren't something I'm massively sensitive to, as I'm lucky with my biology and as such have never really thought about my size / weight or what I'm eating. What she said has got me thinking more about what I eat and when and honestly I don't really appreciate it. I've survived this long just listening to my body, I really don't think I'm in danger and I don't need someone with maladaptive thought processes on the subject telling me how I should be thinking.

Hopefully this is where you guys can come in. Is there something massive I'm missing here? All I've ever tried to do is help her, but to hear she's been telling anyone who matters that just my presence is detrimental to her recovery makes me not want to be around her at all. Is there anything positive I can do, a different perspective I can take, or should I just move house and take my ""ideal body type"" (as she told a mutual friend I have) out of the picture? I don't think either of us feel particularly comfortable anymore.

Tldr: I'm living with a girl with anorexia and she seems to believe my existence blocks her recovery. Is there anything I can do?",1571232545,10/16/2019 8:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dipbzk/request_title_living_with_a_friend_with_anorexia/,3

I was active in my disorder all through high school and recovered for the first time at 21. I got pregnant a few years later and it was really the first time I ate more than twice a day and I gained a lot of weight. I was more worried about staying in recovery and being a new mom so for years I put off weight loss as I afraid of triggering a relapse. After having my second child and seeing a psychiatrist I decided it was time to try healthy weight loss. It’s been great, I lost a lot of weight and was exercising regularly and feeling very happy. I’ve recently hit a plateau and have been staying at the same weight for a few weeks now and it seems to be triggering my old ways. If I feel too full I’ll purge. If I can I’ll try and avoid eating. When I do finally eat even healthy diet safe foods I’ll feel anxious and guilty and in the back of my mind I’ll be thinking of purging. I’m going to discuss it with my husband today and I’m anxious about it. He knows about my past problems and has been doing this healthy weight loss lifestyle with me (we both gained so much weight when I was pregnant with my first son). I guess I’m wanting to hear about others who’ve ever been in this situation. Is it possible to continue losing weight in a healthy way? I’m worried he will want me to see my psychiatrist or counselor and they’ll tell me to stop trying to lose weight and I’ll gain all I’ve lost back. For reference I was obese and am now overweight.

I am 20 F and have struggled with restricting and overeating since around the time I started middle school. Lately I was doing much better with my eating habits (eating healthier foods and eating a healthy amount) but within the past 2 weeks I have become utterly repulsed by food. I live with my family and even if I smell someone cooking something I get nauseous and grossed out. I tried to wash the dishes today but could not keep myself from gagging and I actually threw up twice trying to complete the chore. I lost a lot of weight last month just because I haven’t been eating much since most foods have looked/smelled repulsive lately and I have lost much of my appetite. I have only been okay with eating simple things like baby carrots, a peanut butter sandwich, or fruit. Any type of meat right now seems completely repulsive to me. I see a psychiatrist because I have bipolar disorder type 2, OCPD, PTSD, and generalized anxiety disorder. I am not currently on any medications so medication is not a factor. Talking with the psychiatrist he told me i exhibit “eating disorder behaviors” but I have only seen him 3 times so far so and he has not diagnosed me with an eating disorder.

Hi, I just wanted some advice on how to support my partner who is dealing with an ED and has for most of her life. I’m the only person she’s ever properly opened up to about it and how it’s affected her life, I want the absolute best for her and am aware that while I’ve myself have dealt with eating disorders, they’ve been quite different and through therapy I’ve gotten through them. My partner however sees it more as ‘it’s just how I am’ and while I know she wants to get better she doesn’t know how to go about it. I want to support her and be helpful, I know that me being the ‘food police’ isn’t going to help anything and constantly worrying about her is only going to make her feel worse so I thought if anyone has some advice on how I could support her as well as maintain a healthy relationship, it would be a group like this.

1699,dhiqrj,Request: rapid weight gain during recovery??,"I started recovery about two weeks ago and have somehow already gained enough weight to be at my pre-ED weight.

I thought I was ready for this. I did my research. I watched probably a hundred YouTube videos. I believed what everyone said about not holding back, eating whatever whenever, following all physical and mental hunger cues and not restricting in any way. I forced myself to trust my body. I was feeling pretty good about things. 

Then I messed up. I hadn't weighed myself at all. But I went to the Dr.'s  yesterday and they put my weight on my discharge sheet. And I couldn't help but see it. 

In two weeks, I'm somehow already back at my pre-ED weight, which is where I expected to land at the END of all this (+ maybe a few lbs more).

Where do I go from here? I'm just getting started. I was prepared for MONTHS of bloating and weight gain. But not at this pace. I did NOT expect to balloon overnight. I really thought it might be a couple lbs a week.

1702,dhg621,Request: Going back to treatment (PHP) for the third time - could use a pep talk.,"Hi. I’ve had anorexia, depression, anxiety, and severe OCD for 19 years. I’m 32 two days ago. I’m in PHP though they wanted me in residential. I have no friends or family in my location to help me with my cat and plants, so it’s not an option. Anyway. 

I have anorexia with food, but also with liquids. 

My OCD is severe in that I fear water, so I avoid it. It will make me fat. If it touches me I’m going to absorb it and become hydrated, which is my biggest fear. I’ve had kidney stones, chronic low potassium, constant heart palpitations, blah blah blah. 

This obviously gets addressed in treatment. In my past two programs I did okay. But this year I’m bad enough in my ED, and my OCD has never been this severe in my life. I’m absolutely paralyzed by it. I cried all day today about having to couch the couches that people were putting their shoes on. Why would you do that??? They expect me to touch it??

Anyway, I’m horrified. I feel like I did this on a whim and I’m regretting it. I’m obviously going to have to put on weight, and they’re obviously going to force me to hydrate. I can’t get out of it now. Fuck. 

Also, there’s enormous pressure. I had to ask my parents for financial help to go. My insurance covers me at 100%, but I can’t afford rent and my bills while I’m out. :( 

So if I don’t do well or just stay recovered, it’s like i wasted thousands of their dollars. So I’m so fucking worried that they’re going to be disappointed and angry if I ever relapse. It’s such a hard illness to get through, so I don’t know if they’ll recognize that. It’s so much pressure. :’(

Does anyone have any wisdom to impart, or maybe a pep talk? I’m panicking and I’m so scared.

1706,dgx7a9,Request: Coping with weight gain in recovery," 

I’m new to this sub so apologies if this has been posted time and time again.

I’ve been out of residential and transitional treatment for anorexia with bulimic tendencies for about 2 years now. And have made a ton of progress, definitely not fully recovered, but I was able to start living and supporting a real life again.

However, last week my dietician began asking me if my food intake was any different or unusual and I knew right away she was going to tell me my weight was trending upwards. Because 1) that’s always my constant fear and 2) some skirts had become a little tighter. To say it set me off is an understatement. Even at my sickest, I was never underweight so it’s hard for me to accept my anorexia in a “fat” body and any weight gain seems too much to me.

Since seeing her I haven’t been able to stop thinking about my food intake constantly. Every second it’s “what have I eaten today? Has it been too much? Can I eat this? Do I really need it?” Lets just say my ED voice is very present and my healthy voice is weakening.

So my question to you all is, if you’ve experienced “unnecessary” weight gain in recovery, how did you cope? I’ve come so far and worked so hard on accepting my new body. But I hate that this stupid disease still affects me so much. It’s so demoralizing and honestly just exhausting.

1710,dgx49x,Request: I’m not sure what to do," 

I look back at old pictures and cry

Over two years ago I (F/20) graduated from high school. That was the time before I had any type of eating disorder, ate properly, and was in a relatively happy relationship.

My relationship then took a turn for the worse, I was emotionally abused and sexually assaulted a year ago, and for a while I resorted to sex as the only source of comfort, but that’s another story for another time.

When I tried to give up having sexual relations recklessly, I suddenly found food to be my biggest comfort but also my biggest weakness. To this day I eat more than I should, am always hungry, and thus, have gained a considerable amount since two years ago.

I look back on the pictures from my graduation and cry, because of how recklessly I’ve eaten and how I’ve let myself succumb to food all the time.

I try to talk to my parents about it, but unfortunately, while they are supportive of me, they think I look fine and tell me to stop worrying about what I eat all the time. I’ve taken to counting calories all the time, exercising daily, and probably worst of all staring at myself in the mirror for too long and always calling myself overweight and stupid. And to make myself feel better about the stress these things cause me, I eat. I’m worried this is never going to stop.

I just feel really stuck right now. I’m not sure what to do. I have counselling scheduled for a month from now to take the first steps, but I’m not sure what to do until then.

&amp;#x200B;

For as long as I can remember I’ve had a weird relationship with food..

My step dad would not let me leave the table till I ate everything on my plate even food I hated.

As I hit teen years I didn’t need to eat much I could go a week without breakfast or lunch.

A few years later it developed into comfort eating, I’d eat when I was sad, when I was angry, When I was stressed.

However for the last year I can’t stop eating.. and I feel awful shame over it all.. I get really irritated when my husband tells me I can’t buy certain food or order take out. All day I just eat not large portions but I eat a lot during the day, I can’t stop myself.. I feel disgusting but it’s like I have 0 control..

Most recently though I’ve been sick, especially at night I’ll throw up ( not on purpose I’m an emetaphobic) And I think it’s because I eat so much especially at night ..

I’ve called the doctors and booked an appointment but I don’t know what’s wrong with me .. it’s 11:30am and I’ve eaten half a tub of celebrations, had breakfast and 3 packets of crisps.

To preface ;

* I’m not obese or anything I’m JUST overweight like by 1 stone
* This can happen with junk or health food I legit start with small bites then it’s like I lose control and my brain shuts me out and I eat and eat and eat
* I’ve tried binning unhealthy foods.. but I end up breaking down and just order food ..
* I can’t eat infront of people .. I can infront of my husband and close friends but I can’t infront of others.

This year my in laws are throwing Christmas dinner and we aren’t going because they do a sit and fill your plate yourselves type thing! And last year even though they eat a lot they find it necessary to comment on how much I eat Comments like “oh where do you store it all?” “Oh careful it will catch up later on!” They don’t mean it maliciously as they don’t know of my struggles!

I’m scared the doctors will just tell me I’m greedy or.. something

I don’t know what’s wrong with me I don’t know anyone else like this.. I hate myself and how disgusting I am and how I feel.. and what I’m doing to my body",1571882075,10/23/2019 20:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dm9lvm/request_i_think_i_have_a_problem_and_i_dont_know/,0

But I have since been in therapy and gone to my doctor, and if I want to lose weight, we do it the healthy way. Both areas were very supportive. My boyfriend is super supportive, because my ED almost cost us our relationship. But I don’t need to tell you that every single day is a continuous struggle. I constantly obsess over what I eat, if we’re going out I’ll look at the menu beforehand, I’m worried if I’m eating too much, and I’m always planning my meals in my head. It’s like I can never catch a break. I don’t want this to seem like I’m pro ED, because I’m not, I just want help in order to stop obsessing over food.

1723,dm9k8r,Request: How do I get out of this mindset before it gets worse?,"Hi, I’m a 20-year-old female of a healthy weight right now who has been on a weight loss journey since December last year. So far I’ve been successful, having shed about 25% of my size and I’m down at the last few vanity pounds and trying to work on my fitness at the moment. 

I have been counting calories and intermittently fasting since the start, and that means I skip breakfast and only eat lunch and dinner. It has been a lot of discipline, but in the last three weeks I have transitioned to eating only one meal a day, which I estimate to be around xxxx kcal and I fast till the next afternoon after each meal. 

The idea of eating dinner or anything out of my eating window has started to give me anxiety, and I don’t let myself have any snacks, mainly because there isn’t anything much I like to eat that’s accessible as I am overseas for school right now. This three weeks coincide with me starting a gym membership for the first time in my life, and I have been going at least twice to four times a week, for a minimum of one class (usually two) plus yyy kcal of cardio each time. 

Am I exhibiting signs of an eating disorder? Today I broke my fast for the first time in a good few months, and I ate a fairly normal amount for the entire day, with about 1/4 of it in the night in the form of fruits, nuts and ice cream. I’m not beating myself up about it, but I don’t want to fall into a cycle of overeating and underrating, especially because lately I’ve been feeling that I need to go to bed hungry, otherwise I’ve eaten too much for the day and tomorrow I’m going to have to eat less. I’ve finally started to like the reflection in the mirror,  so I definitely don’t want to jeopardise my progress, after spending so much effort losing weight. 

I know I’m going to have to transition into maintenance sooner or later, but the idea of eating two meals a day now scare me, and I’m already on the verge of throwing away the ice cream in the fridge because I don’t particularly enjoy the taste of it, and I don’t like wasting calories on things I don’t enjoy. Everyone’s been congratulating me on my weight loss and telling me to keep it up, and I don’t know how to deal with these new feelings regarding food and my body. I still feel fat, and I pinch my stomach and thighs all the time and find myself disappointed at the fat that still surrounds them. 

What can I do to help myself? I would really appreciate some tips and advice that I can apply right away, and I also have a history of depression that might be affecting my mood at this moment in time. It’s hard to pretend that I’m fine with everything and to deal with these conflicting feelings, and I feel like I’ve failed when I put something unhealthy into my mouth. I don’t think I’ve lost control yet, and I am definitely not looking to be underweight or to starve myself.

1724,dm9jo9,Request: falling back into my disorder?,"i don't really want to get too into detail but i've been struggling a lot lately. i've been battling depression, anxiety and ptsd for years and i'm finally getting better with self harming within the past few months. i'm still doing it but not as often. I've begun to restrict my diet again. in the past it was always an issue. I'd starve myself for days, then eventually binge one day, and starve myself again. I started noticing when i was maybe 9, being like 'oh shit i might have an eating disorder'. i've had a rough childhood, lots of trauma. its caused a lot. but i never really realized and i never really cared. I just knew i hated the way i looked. i was never really big, looking back on it now. i just knew i was bigger than i wanted to be. i've always been a stick - it's just in my genetics. but as i got older, hitting puberty and all - i started to notice my hips, my thighs expanding, and of course the change of sizes in clothing. and for anybody, this would just be normal. of course people grow and bodies change. but it was really hard for me. especially with my past and how i was treated. I've never been comfortable or confident with my body. but about two years ago i started eating regularly and i felt fine about it because i began going to the gym. i felt a lot better about myself. but after a few months of that, a lot was going on and i couldn't go to the gym anymore. i was eating regularly still for about a month. and then i just started feeling so disgusted with myself. and i snapped, again. this went on (on and off) for the rest of that year. 

so, for the past year i've been doing fairly good. i was eating regularly for a while, with a little bit of ups and downs, but about two months ago i was sent to a facility due to my depression - and there i was forced to eat. it was hard at first but eventually i looked forward to meals. i've been home now for about a month and a half, at first i was eating regularly and barley even worrying about weight or calories. however, the past two weeks my mind has been fucking with me. i've been in an outpatient facility until i can go back to school. (which i'll be going back Tuesday) but i guess i'm just concerned. i said i was going to eat healthy and try to cut calories. and i was. i was counting and eating my exact amount i should be eating. but these past three days i haven't let myself eat anything over *** calories. i was hungry at first, but now i'm feeling kind of immune to the feeling - like i was in the past. i kind of like the feeling now. and it scares me. because i don't want to go back to my old ways but at the same time i could lose some weight. i just get so upset looking in the mirror and not seeing my hip bones stick out as much as they used to, and my thighs bigger than normal. at least it all feels that way. it feels like the mirror is too small for me, if that makes sense. i've gained four pounds during the hospital and i plan to lose 10. 

I don't know what kind of advice i'm hoping to receive. all i know is i'm fucking scared. I know i really want to lose weight and i'm already beginning to obsess over it. but i think i can stick to my low calorie diet. I'm just scared that i'll go back to nearly nothing because what i'm doing now is almost close to that already. and i know i'm the only person who can control what i do and what i eat, but i also know that part of me wants to go back to that. also it feels like it's kind of an alternative to self harming. i know this isn't healthy at all and i know i'm a wreck. but please if anybody has tips or advice, just let me know. i'm really struggling and i can't really talk to any loved ones about this without them freaking out and it damaging me more. thank you :)",1571881760,10/23/2019 20:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dm9jo9/request_falling_back_into_my_disorder/,1

My girlfriend and I are both in our late teens and from what she has told me she had a pretty severe ED that she only started really recovering from around 2 years ago. She seems fine with most foods and eating in general but only does so in small portions or she'll just feel queasy, which I assume is fine. She's just slightly underweight for her height - she is also really small height-wise if that helps.

She still lives with her parents who are not the best and make jokes about it, which she says often makes her eat less or not at all. I'm terrified of her slipping back into it again and I'm fully there for support, I don't talk about it with her too often unless she brings it up, and I never ask for specifics. Is there anything I can do to help her more? Also any general info/advice is very much appreciated.

1727,dljxov,Request: My ongoing recovery story," 

&amp;#x200B;

My childhood wasn’t the greatest. I was basically raised by my dad when I was a baby and by my aunt when I was a toddler because my mom was a teacher and was gone quite a lot.

My dad didn’t talk to me or interact with me. He fed me and put me down for naps, but I remember clearly one day he had put me in my crib because he was upset that I had colored on the wall and punched the hall wall in front of me by accident; he’s never really looked before hitting something. And when I was about thirteen I saw him destroy our garage for something my brother did. I hid in my room the rest of the day and didn’t eat. But that’s not what started it. Only where it started to get worse.

When I was six, two years after my mom and dad divorced, I had a brother at my dads and a sister at my moms. I felt replaced and confused. I knew my step mom and dad since four, they got married to each other when I was around that age. But I didn’t understand why I didn’t get as much time with my parents as they did. I didn’t understand why my siblings in the house I lived with had a dad around 24/7 and I didn’t.

Things were way different in the house I visited rather than the house I lived in. My step mom treated me like a doll and I didn’t know what I was feeling but I know that I felt weird and not happy. I was never girly and she took that away from me. She took who I was away. She forced me to eat everything on my plate, and they were wrong portions to give a child. And even after I threw up packaged lunch meat, she made me eat packaged lunch meat later on. I gagged on condiments but they kept ending up on the sandwiches I would tear apart because I hated sandwiches. I got hit, yelled at, and grounded just for not eating and “making excuses”.

When kids complain something hurts, they can’t swallow, they are itchy, or there tongue is tingly - it usually means they are allergic to something. I got rashes and hives when I ate certain fruits when I was young but my stepmom kept giving them to me and would take caution with her child.

My dad tried doing something but she wouldn’t let him. Eventually he had enough and I remember them fighting one night, putting us to bed, and then sometime in the middle of the night after Christmas day - my dad took me away from there with him.

When we were a little older, my dad met someone else but I knew he was seeing multiple girls before finding this one. I broke a necklace that a girl gave my dad to give to me. I didn’t want anyone else. I just wanted me and my dad. I didn’t eat much during this time. He was always better to me than my brother but I still was blinded some because of him.

My second stepmom was better about food but still made us eat everything on our plates. Eventually we got older and she stopped doing that as much but would still ask us to eat something that wasn’t on our plates.

When I was a nanny I fell into anorexia and tried being Vegan. At one point all I ate was apples and developed orthorexia. Once I lost my period I started incorporating foods back into my diet. I went through binge eating and then bulimia. Soon I was on a Keto diet and started to feel amazing. Eventually I went back home and my diet changed again. I went back to eating apples and avoided everything. I had panic attacks trying foods again, but, yet again, eventually I asked for help and now I have been listening to my body and eating the right things for me. I eat the correct portions, and eat what doesn’t make me sick.

It can take a while to find a way of eating that works for you, especially with experience of eating disorders and being forced to eat certain amounts of things put certain things and when you don’t have the means to do so or doctors - the people that are supposed to help - don’t give you correct information. Some of the things I have, I’ve heard that not many doctors or clinics can really help on. I mean, I’m doing everything a doctor would do to me anyway. I mostly go for eyes, ears, checkups, and emergencies.

Anyway. Through my journey I’ve realized I can only eat fish, chicken, veggies, fruits and anything not associated with gluten, nuts, sugar, red meat, corn, oil, and dairy. My digestive system is healthy and happier, I’m healthy and happy and I enjoy food again.

I have a history of diabetes so I’m most likely pre type 1 diabetes. I have low blood sugar - which was also a sign for my anemia (which I did get tested for a long time ago as well as the gluten/celiacs thing by a certified nutritionist and chakra healer). I have history of depression, anxiety, ADHD/ADD (known since little), diabetes, thyroid, Lupus, losing your memory/brain fog, AIP, sciatica, and such.

I found out I have Candida, SIBO, IBS, GERD/acid reflux, and I also have a few food allergies; pineapple, strawberries (better when frozen and organic), kiwi, arugula, cilantro, bananas, and corn.

I follow a few different lifestyle “rules” along side being pescatarian which works better for me than vegan ever did though I try to still eat vegan/raw vegan every now and then. I eat out maybe once a month now and on occasion, like birthdays. It’s still a little hard to reach full recovery with still living at home but I’m making do for seven more months.

I’m not fully recovered by my history of eating disorders as I still struggle time to time but I just wanted to share my story and say that it is hard to live with, but with the right resources and fixes - you will be okay and someday be able to enjoy food again. I believe in all of you.

Some background info: I've been small all my life. I'm studying my last year at uni, and i've been very stressed out, to a point where skipping lunches is a regular thing for me. So, this is where it begins to get weird. I dont feel hunger, until maybe late evening, and as a result I dont eat much (maybe 1-1,5 meals a day depending).

I'm medium/short height (im a female, not sure if that matters to the equation) and I'm underweight. My partner keeps telling me that I'm becoming skin and bones basically, but I really dont see it. 

About a week ago I fainted, and ever since I keep getting headaches even though I drink a lot of water and sleep enough.

I've written it off as me just being stressed, and thats why my body is reacting this way, but could it be a possibility that I have an eating disorder?

I know it probably sounds strange with me asking since I said I eat very little, but I really dont understand it as I dont feel the hunger or see myself as skinny. I do notice i've lost some weight, but I dont think im that skinny.

Thank you for your time, I barely know anything about eating disorders and I'm just generally confused...

I've also started regularly getting low fevers in the evenings. I have absolutely no idea what to make of this. I dont know if it's related at all, or if maybe this is all just a stress thing.

I've always had suspicions  about my eating habits for a long time but I always pushed it away,  convincing myself that it was normal and that I was just overreacting.  but now im not so sure anymore.  My parents are constantly pushing me to eat more, they always tell me  that I'm not eating enough and that I'm not eating healthy. I will skip  meals frequently. If I have to go swimming or go to a party where im  going to be wearing something tight I will refuse to eat anything all  day so I can look as skinny as possible. I used to be a ballet dancer  and I would skip meals all the time to look skinny in leotards or for  performances. I've tried to eat healthy before, I'd force myself to eat  three meals a day with no snacking inbetween, but after a day or two I'd  give up and binge on junk food. I'd just feel absolutely terrible about  myself afterwards. When I quit dancing a couple months ago I was  terrified about gaining weight, I skipped meals more frequently but  always in the end I'd give in, buy loads of junk food and lock myself in  my room to binge. Everytime I look at myself in the mirror I nitpick  everything. I'm not consistently weighing myself or obsessed about how  much I weigh, its all physical for me. The worst state that I had ever  been in was in middle school. I would take a jar of peanut butter to  school and have spoonfuls of that to tide me over for breakfast and  lunch. Now, that I'm in college It's gotten a little better but I still  sink back into my old habits.  I'm just tired of feeling bad all the time.

I think about food so much I just want it, and then I try to throw it out, or sabotage it by making it gross. then I find myself hours later taking it out of the trash and trying to eat it and hating myself so much after. Sometimes I’m not even hungry. I hate myself for failing so much. I’ve thrown away full bags of chips and then went to dig them out to eat them. Sometimes I feel like I *have* to eat.

I’m starting to realize this is a problem. Deeper than food, deeper than my ability to stick to a plan. I always told myself I just wasn’t strict enough.

1735,dl750g,Request: Could I have an eating disorder?,"I know I really need to ask a doctors opinion, but that’s not very easy for me to do. Here’s a rundown of the situation:

I’ve had bad eating habits my whole life. I was raised to gorge myself. When I was about 11 or 12, I decided to diet, and that quickly spiraled into me eating maybe half a PB&amp;J a day, with lots of dance and working out. My middle school bf highly encouraged this behavior. 

I got too hungry and tried to forget about how stressed eating made me. I was good for a while, but then when I was 14, I went through this again. More aggressively this time. I’d have some celery and diet soda everyday. I’d give myself 1/4 to 3/4 a cup of cereal with no milk if I felt dizzy. This time I had to work to get out of it. I ended up okay. 

It happened again about a year ago. I had become grossly overweight and started dieting in a healthy way. It took two months and I started eating poorly again. I lost a lot of weightin a month. Any week where I lost less than 3 or 4 lbs felt like a disaster. After a lot of work and a little bit of counseling I was fine. 

I’ve been fantasizing about it again. Thinking, “If only I weren’t so fat. If only I could look like ____.” Eating has gone from something I can enjoy, to a chore and now a fear. My tipping point was dinner today I had a breakdown over carbs. Carbs?? A piece of a baguette. I don’t want to get worse. 

1. I need help on how to curb these tendencies. 
-I really can’t afford a Drs visit rn, I want to avoid any health expenses unless completely necessary. 

2.  Can this really be an eating disorder if I’ve never been underweight and if I’ve been able to get myself out of it before?

1743,dk1soc,Request: Scared," 

Hi, I’m not sure how to word all of this but I’m just going to write it as it comes. I don’t know exactly what I’m looking for either, mostly just to know I’m not making it up in my head?

I’ve always been overweight, since I was an early teen. Food was my comfort blanket, my escape in a way. I always over ate, and I gained a lot of weight very quickly between ages 14-18 I’d say. (I’m not sure if age goes against the numbers rule, please remove if they do!) My relationship with food has been unhealthy for as long as I can remember. I dieted a lot, anything from slimming groups, shakes, meal replacements, fat blocker or carb blocker tablets, the alphabet diet, etc. I tried anything. But I always fell back into what I now would identify as binging habits. Eating so much I felt unwell, hiding the evidence, feeling incredibly guilty, gaining more weight.

This pattern carried on until about 6 months ago. I don’t know how it started and I don’t remember anything triggering it. But I stopped eating breakfast first. Then I started challenging myself to sit with the feeling of hungry. This spiralled, and now I either don’t eat for days, or I eat so much I throw up (not intentionally). This past week has been the worst. I’m not sitting here thinking, I don’t wanna eat, I’m not going to eat. I just don’t. I feel hungry and I drink water and distract myself and tell myself I’ll cook later, I just can’t be bothered. But I never think “no I’m not going to eat.” Then, if I do eat, it’ll be half a meal. Just chicken nuggets and nothing else. A child’s portion. A packet of crisps. A few squares of chocolate. And in my head I’m thinking, I’m just cutting my portions down, I need to do that. Or I’ll cook a huge meal and eat until I throw up and then cry about it.

The thing that made how unhealthy this is click, was going for a check up at the doctors and I got weighed. (Haven’t weighed myself in 4ish months). I’ve lost the most amount of weight, I’ve ever lost in any of the time I’ve tried to diet. And I was so happy I cried on the way home. That’s when it clicked, I think. Because then I didn’t want to change, I decided to keep doing whatever I was doing mostly subconsciously, consciously. I opened up about it to my friend who has a diagnosed ED and she told me to speak to my doctor but I’m scared. I’m still overweight, by a lot for my height and I don’t think I’ll be taken seriously. How can I have an eating disorder, but still be grossly overweight? But I’m also scared for where this will end up, I already struggle with several mental health issues and I don’t want to end up in a dark place.

Will my doctor believe me? Does anyone else have any similar experiences? Am I being dramatic? Does this even qualify as an eating disorder? I don’t know what to do, or if I should even do anything, and that’s why I decided to reach out to this group.",1571479709,10/19/2019 5:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dk1soc/request_scared/,6

1. Are you forced to eat the full meals provided? And, if you don’t, what happens?
2. How do they measure progress? If you continue to lose weight, but are starting to feel better mentally, is that considered progress?

1746,dk1qn2,Request: Seeking advice and simply wanting to tell someone,"I (21F) have struggled with a handful of mental illnesses for most of my life. 6 years ago I was admitted to an inpatient facility, mainly for depression and because my parents panicked when they found out I was self harming. At the time, I was also severely underweight and struggling with anorexia. Now that I look back, I realize nobody ever addressed my eating disorder or tried to help me with the mental aspect of it. They were only focused on my depression and self harm. It kind of makes me sad that nobody seemed to address something that was so obvious. 

I have since continued to struggle with body image issues but have lately been in the deepest place since then. I can’t even tell if I should call it a relapse or not. The mental aspect of my disorder is definitely present and I am thinking about my food intake and body image constantly. I’m counting calories again and hating myself when I eat something “bad.” However, my weight loss this time is completely different from my first experience. I haven’t been able to drop any weight despite restricting calories and it’s starting to make the mental battle in my mind a thousand time worse. I’ve also been self medicating my depression with cannabis after bad med experiences. I guess in a way it’s kind of good because it’s forcing me to eat after restricting all day. Although it’s making me feel particularly frustrated and angry with myself. 

I feel like i’m reaching a point where I don’t even want to tell anybody because I don’t want to get better. I know deep down I am heading down a dangerous path again, but it feels like nothing in my capability wants me to change. It’s like I’m clinging to the control to cope with my other disorders in this heavy period of life right.

I was/am severely bulimic for 5 years or so, and anorexic before that, and I only stopped purging /fasting/restricting since I became pregnant (for my baby's sake). I realised recently that even though I stopped purging/restricting/fasting, my mentality is still exactly the same and I am plagued by disordered thoughts, it's driving me crazy, and I feel like as soon as I'm not pregnant anymore I'll go straight back to the bulimia. So recently I started reading many books about Intuitive Eating and I really want to try to recover, for mine and my baby's sake.
The only problem is, I live in Japan and although I have a healthy bmi, the nurses here have put me on a strict guideline that I'm not allowed to gain more than 10kg throughout my whole pregancy (I've already gained 3kg) and have told me that I need to restrict salt, sugar, and processed food. I've also seen in various places that I should not eat ""junk""/processed food, sugary food etc while pregnant, for the sake of my baby. (I haven't told them about my eating disorder history) and if I don't be incredibly careful of what I eat, I may develop pre eclampsia / gestational diabetes etc... 
I've heard that in recovery, I should eat whatever I want, I shouldn't restrict anything, I should try not to feel guilty when eating, and this is important in recovering from my eating disorder. 
But I don't feel like I can when I have these rules from the nurses hanging over my head, also I can't help but feel incredibly guilty if I ever eat anything processed, because I've heard that it could harm my baby, which I'm terrified of doing.
So I'm at the point where I feel like I almost have no choice but to keep restricting the types of food I eat and maybe this isn't the right time to recover? I feel really stuck.

We have been together for a little less then a year and it has become clear that she is moving in a bad direction towards a potential full relapse. She has gotten treatment before at a time when she was extremely sick. Now she is engaging in more and more behaviors and has told me that she does not intend to get better until she gets to where she was again. 

I am honestly scared and doing everything I can to try to help her make the right decision and hopefully convince her that now is a good time. She doesn’t think she needs it yet because she’s not as sick as she once has gotten. She has been offered financial support to seek treatment but doesn’t want to accept it. I know I can’t force her to do anything, but I am scared of losing her and hate seeing her in pain like this. She’ll go days without anything, drinks caffeine to stay awake, and takes Ativan to sleep. She thinks it’s a perfect recipe to reach her goals and doesn’t care about the consequences. Whenever I think she is going to make progress she only does it for a few days until it’s unbearable and she continues the bad behaviors. She’s even told me that the only way to make it stop is to either fight it and get treatment or let it take her. She’s accepted the fact that it might kill her and doesn’t feel strong enough to fight it. She has a team already but doesn’t want to reach out because she feels like she’s not there yet. I don’t know what to do. I feel hopeless in my attempts to convince her that she can get better and doesn’t have to let this control her. She knows the risks but thinks she’s healthy and thinks she knows exactly how to balance on the line between her ideal self and doing real damage to her organs or body.

I know it would be beneficial to see a therapist, but I guess I’m feeling really tired of constantly going to appointments and talking about my feelings. But I am still recovery oriented and I have no desire to go back to my eating disorder.

However, I feel like I am in a weird place right now. I am a college student and my schedule is pretty intense between school and work and it is so difficult to get all of my meals in as I’d like to. I lost a few pounds after leaving treatment but nothing too crazy, though I am not at the weight that my treatment team set for me. I never actually made it to that weight when in treatment despite being on a high meal plan. So, I just feel weird. I don’t feel like I am engaging in my eating disorder, but I know my meals should be better and I want them to be better. It just feels so hard to consistently accomplish my meal goals with everything else going on in life. Not to mention I am on stimulant meds for ADHD which decrease my appetite, but I don’t feel like that’s really a barrier when it comes to eating. I can eat when I’m not hungry without any issue. 

I don’t really want advice on how to meet my meal goals with a busy schedule, I have plenty of advice as far as that goes. Just, has any one else experienced something similar with recovery? I feel like I’m not doing it right because I’m not the weight I should be and I’m not consistently eating every meal. In inpatient, they always said that because we have an eating disorder, it’s not okay for us to miss a meal whereas “normal” people can miss breakfast and it’s not a big deal. And I’m always questioning myself. I don’t feel like I’m restricting intentionally… it feels more situational, but in the back of my head I’m always thinking that I’m doing this wrong and I’m letting the eating disorder win because that is what treatment taught me. I have a positive relationship with food and my body (though I wish I could gain more weight, but having a fast metabolism means eating way more than I have time or money for). I’m the same weight I was pre-eating disorder and I feel like this is exactly how I would be about food if I never had an eating disorder to begin with. But maybe I’m just trying to justify bad behaviors? I don’t know. It was easy to choose recovery because the eating disorder was ruining my life. But now? I don’t feel like I have bad intentions or motivations like I used to. So how do I change? Do I even need to change really? 

Sorry if this is confusing and kind of a mess. I don’t really now how to express what I’m feeling.",1572405039,10/29/2019 22:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dp137z/request_posttreatment_eating_disorder_recovery/,2
1758,dp12of,Request: Please help,"Hi all. New to this sub, so apologies for rule breaking and on mobile etc.

Friend (24f) of mine (31f) has been in a treatment center before for severe anorexia and over exercising. She is in her early 20’s and relapsed severely. She’s severely underweight now. Her doctor stopped seeing her because she refuses to follow the program, lies to seem on track, etc. 

My wedding is in three weeks and she says she just wants to be there and then she will get help. I am afraid she won’t make it. Her stomach isn’t working, her body functions are slowing down or stopping, and I am so afraid she will either die before, during, or after my wedding. 

I am struggling because as much as i want her to be there, I want SO MUCH MORE for her to get help and be healthy. I have been really honest with her about wanting her to go to treatment NOW. Some other friends suggested un-inviting her to my wedding so she understands she needs to get help.

I think if I did that I would try to say as much as I want you there, I would rather have you go get healthy and focus on yourself rather than celebrating me, and my goal is for her to come out of treatment and be able to celebrate with my then husband and I together. So basically make a special event just for her.

My questions are obviously a lot.

1. Is this a good idea? I would rather have her mad at me than dead.

2. Are there any other tips? She is pretty adamant that she can self manage but this has never been self managed. 

3. Am I being insensitive? Should I just be wholeheartedly supporting her no matter what?? 


Thank you in advance. I honestly just want the best for her and I’m legitimately scared every day that she won’t wake up.",1572404967,10/29/2019 22:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dp12of/request_please_help/,13

1760,donk89,Request: Request?,"Idk if I’m honestly confused or just in denial?

I’ve read through the FAQs and a whole bunch of research articles online tonight and took the EAT-26 quiz... basically I don’t know if I actually have an eating disorder and don’t know/am in denial of it or if it’s actually just an abnormal eating pattern from physical symptoms? 
Most websites said something like “if you’re wondering if you have an ED, you probably have an ED” I don’t think I really buy that, but I also kept scoring in the “high risk” category.

I’m a 23 year old Male and I’ve had GI problems in the past (and probably present) that caused me a lot of discomfort after eating. I don’t eat at work or in the morning, if I do eat it is usually dinner-time and it’s often a sugary dessert like a milkshake. Dairy is really bad for my digestion so I kind of figure if I’m going to do it, might as well have something that I really like and that will evacuate my body as soon as possible. It’s gotten to the point where I only eat a few days a week and I’m not sure if it’s really because my stomach is upset or because I’m psychologically causing it?
I know obviously my eating pattern isn’t considered “normal”, but I’m not sure if it is really ED rooted or just not healthy. I feel like absolute shit after I do eat, but that could just be normal because what I ate was objectively bad for you. I know I didnt always eat this way, and there have been times in my life where I ate at least 2 balanced meals a day, I don’t even know when or why I stopped I guess. I live on my own so no one really notices and I’ve realized I’m more and more avoidant of sit-down meals out or staying over family/friends houses or eating in front of anybody really. My co-workers have occasionally noticed that I don’t take lunch and I just instinctively lie and say I eat a big breakfast each morning. I’ve been trying to analyze my intentions behind this and it is true that I want to maintain a certain physique, but I figure everyone does to some extent. It’s more like I just feel better with an empty stomach. I feel like I’m awake and alert and on top of my shit and my stomach doesn’t feel like it is actively murdering me. I feel like I am making excuses and covering it up because I don’t want anyone to think anything of it and I really really don’t want anyone to intervene in my habits. But I also feel like there isn’t anything wrong with me and I am just trying to prevent people from prying. To me it all feels very private and just thinking about that makes me feel anxious. 
Having actually written out that last part I do kind of see how this could be disordered eating I guess I haven’t ever lined up my feelings about food before.

1763,donhvc,Request: just want to thank the community and introduce myself,"Iv been lurking between a few of these reddit forums for eating disorders lately.

I was going to post anonymously because I didnt particularly want to be tied to this, but I'm trying to get to a point where own what's going in with myself.

It wasnt until recently that I admitted to myself that I had a problem.  One that's been with me for years.  For the longest time I blamed being sick or that I was reacting to food badly but I got to the point where I was sick of making excuses.

After losing a lot of weight I became obsessed with that one or two extra pounds and for years went through purging forcefully to the point where I'd eat anything unhealthy and my body would react.

I didn't want to accept that I had a problem, because how could a big dude have an eating disorder?  But I came to find out through and other forums that others had the same issue and it really helped me take a first step in admitting I have a problem.  

It got so bad that I started to gain weight because it destroyed my metabolism. So much that I stopped eating for extended periods of time, made it worse, and the cycle just perpetuated itself.  I would literally have a bowl of cereal and go running until my body couldnt move for the sake of justifying food, and then still end throwing up because I hated how I felt and looked.

Everything just kept mounting up, up until I stopped doing costumes entirely because I couldnt look at myself in photos.  My depression and unhealthy relationship from food got worse and worse.  

So here i am, taking the first step and admitting out loud that i have an issue, and thanking all those.who have posted with similar issues in helping me move forward from here.  

Time to get healthy for the first time in a long time, and not just my food but my mind.

1766,do6sy7,Request: im confused and sad and i just want advice i guess," 

i’m genuinely so confused and depressed. i don’t have an eating disorder but i’ve been struggling with my weight for as long as i can remember and its recently getting worryingly worse.

the first time i really thought about my weight was when i was probably about five and i was in the car and i looked and my thighs and i was not living for it, i wasn’t fat but i really felt like it; but because i was a kid i just kind of shoved it to the back of my mind and did shit normally - it didn’t effect me but i was aware of it if u know what i mean.

the idea of body weight really started to consume my thoughts when i got into secondary school though (age 11). i was okay(ish) with my own body, but the thought kind of lingered, you know?

but at this time me and my sister (2 years older) shared a room. let me preface the next thought by saying something; I AM AWARED HOW SHITTY THIS SEEMS BUT I WAS A KID AND BITCHES BE RUTHLESS SO LET ME LIVE I STILL FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME. because me and my sister shared a room and only had one mirror which was on my side it was pretty regular for her to try on outfits and shit in the mirror and i would be able to see, but i would look at her and just think to myself, ‘wow shes so fat,’ and ‘her tummy isn’t flat,’ and i used to be like ‘i hope i never look like that.’ kicker is she wasn’t, and still isn’t, fat. like yeah shes a little chubby but like its fine.

flash forward to like the summer holidays after year 8 (ages 13), karma was really a bitch and i was SO insecure about my weight. to the point where i wouldn’t eat all day, and then only eat dinner so my mum wouldn’t get suspicious. thing is i knew i wasn’t fat but i felt like it if that makes sense, i had a flat tummy and a weirdly small waist (which i was chill with), but my THIGHS, i shit you not they stressed me out so much. i did pretty intense dance classes (including ballet), and if you have ever seen or done ballet you know that takes mad muscle in your legs. so naturally, my legs were pretty chunky, and i was not having it. i remember my mum and sister used to call me lesbian legs and shit like that and it really took a toll on my confidence (not that theres anything wrong with the gays, they’re alright), it was just hurt that they were okay with having a laugh at my expense.

around the christmas break of year 9 (age 14) was where shit kinda hit that fan, for a while i had been wanting to quit dance, i really enjoyed it and made loads of good friends there, but leaving had always been in the back of my mind because i was sick of the muscle-y legs. but i needed an excuse. so when the main teacher there left, i seized the opportunity and after a while of nagging my reluctant dad, i quit. I QUIT A PASSION I LOVED BECAUSE I DIDNT LIKE HAVING MUSCLE-Y FUCKING LEGS, FOR GODS FUCKING SAKE WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME.

and in addition to this, around the same time my mum and her ex boyfriend (who, may i add, i think has given me some mindset problems; like i’ve never gotten on with my mum because of him, he teared down my confidence, make me scared to share my emotions and feelings, and made me feel isolated from everyone else. when i told my mum this - respectfully, cause it was a touchy subject - she would scream at me which kinda made me more shy of sharing my thoughts and feelings, which is probably why i’m discussing my body image issues on reddit when i have literally told no one about this). wow i went off on a tangent, but anyways, my mum and her ex had a messy break up back in september and it kinda dragged out and to make a long story short, at this time i would get in from school; feel depressed because pf hormones i guess; be hungry as shit; my mum would say she could her voices shouting over the road from our house (where he ex lived oops)(also: this made everyone think she was crazy because who cant hear even the loudest of shouting when there is a busy main road in between the houses); she would shout at me for not being able to hear the voices; i would sit in my room alone and feel guilty and unable to share my thoughts; then my sister would get home from her boyfriends at 10pm and shout at me for not helping our mum even though MY SISTER DIDN’T KNOW HALF OF THE SITUATION BECAUSE SHE WAS NEVER HOME, AND SHE WOULDN’T LISTEN TO ME WHEN I TRIED TO COMMUNICATE HOW TERRIFYING IT IS TO A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WHEN AN AUTHORITATIVE FIGURE IS SHOUTING AT YOU FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR VOICES.

to summarise, i was in a bad situation and i think i might of been depressed lol.

but the point of that tangent, i moved in with my dad because my mum wasn’t stable at the time.

now this may all seem irrelevant but this is probably the most important part, because at my dads he was lowkey concerned about my eating but like wouldn’t straight up say it. like he accepted i wouldn’t eat breakfast because i said it made me feel sick. but his girlfriend (who was probably more concerned that him because i assume she gets what its like to be a teenage girl and wanting to lose weight to feel like we fit in), she would buy me food to eat after school (healthy food, but still food) and i always ate it because i have no self control and felt bad and didn’t want to disappoint them i guess.

because my metabolism (i’m not a doctor i’m just making educated guesses at this point) wasn’t used to much food at all i put on some weight on my legs which pretty much brought me back to square one. the muscle that was no longer in use had now turned into fat and i was putting on weight. so now my legs weren’t even just big they were also JIGGLY FOR CHRISTS SAKE.

mind you i still wasn’t even particularly fat, like i had a flat stomach, tiny waist, but big legs. i wasn’t fat, and i knew it, but i FELT fat.

my living arrangement and weight gain stayed the same until about may, by then i was visiting my mum on fridays to saturdays and she was becoming more stable. and my dad was getting an extension (which if you have ever had one you will know they’re a nightmare). so i had to go and stay with my mum for a while. by now my body was used to much more food that previously, i was eating two solid meals per day, but would also like binge eat a lot during the day. i tried to purge, but found out i have very little of a gag reflex when i’m in control, like i would literally sit bu the toilet with my fingers pretty damn far down my throats pressing hard on the back of my tongue and nothing was happening, i was pretty fucking devastated say the least.

but nonetheless i moved back into my mums house, planning to cut down on the food big time. but i couldn’t, and it was literally so heart breaking and frustrating to me.

if you couldn’t tell food and weight was all i could think about now, and i knew it was bad.

i would constantly tell myself, ‘okay next week only one meal like old times,’ and when i couldn’t control myself it would be, ‘okay no food at all next week,’ and i couldn’t do that remotely. i felt so useless, which made me feel so depressed and isolated. i think this is when i began to realise this was becoming a problem. i would begin to eat a food item and halfway through i wouldn’t be able to eat it anymore because it made me feel disgusting.

another incident i would like to bring up is one time in the car when my mum offered me a biscuit, i declined, and she said with the most disgust in her voice, ‘why are you starving yourself,’ i cried about that like a week later, it hurt that she wasn’t at all understanding, like mental health isn’t something we talk about unless its hers. she proper fishes for sympathy all the time but when i try and help or offer support she shouts at me saying that i wouldn’t understand cause i’m a kid. that kinda sucked.

another quick incident, last month, for the first time in literally my whole life i wanted to talk about my mental health to my mum, i seriously thought (and still kinda think) i’m depressed, and i want to feel better. so i told her about what i was feeling and my thoughts on the subject, and bitch, let me tell you, the most invalidating thing i have ever experienced was (and still is) being told, ‘you’re not depressed, its just hormones,’ and yes. this may be true, but you don’t say that, i put myself in a vulnerable position (which was a big arse step) only to get dismissed.

the unhealthy body image continued till year 10 (age 15, now) in this past month things have gotten worryingly worse, last week i literally went on the biggest food binge ever, i mean PROPER BINGE, everyday for a week i ate until it hurt, physically hurt my stomach. and i think this because i grew 1 inch taller in a week (mad ik) but it made me feel so shitty. not only do i now have big jiggly legs, my stomach isn’t flat anymore, like it isn’t huge but it makes a big difference because i have pretty small hips so i kinda just lost my waistline and i look like a cereal box. it makes me feel so disgusting. most of all i’ve just had a week break for half term, so i’m scares that when i go back people are going to notice that i’ve put on weight.

i think i want to cut down on food, like one meal a day, like i used to, and then slowly cut down more. idk i’m going to see how it goes, because as of now i’m more concerned about my stomach than my legs, but still, i want to lose weight.

thanks for reading this long arse post, i just really need advice, or maybe just someone to say they understand, i just don’t want to feel alone i guess.",1572257340,10/28/2019 5:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/do6sy7/request_im_confused_and_sad_and_i_just_want/,2
1767,do6s09,Request: Is my heart rate related to anorexia," 

I have lot a lot of weight this year and have went from overweight to a couple lbs above being underweight. I work out 5-6 days a week, religiously count calories, constantly worry about what I am eating, religiously weigh myself and track my weight... I have a hard time eating in front of people or eating in public, I am constantly told I am too skinny, people tell me they are concerned... Yet I still feel a need to lose weight. I just want to lose a couple more lbs. I don't feel ""small"", I certainly don't think I look skinny. I seriously still am thick and I don't like it.

I am seeing a cardiologist for a preexisting condition, but I don't know if my eating habits are making things worse. I have done 7 cardiac tests in the past 2 weeks because I pass out frequently (but I have had this going on for years, well prior to any weight loss). But he has some concerns because my blood pressure is low (85/55) and my resting heart rate at my last appt was 44. He told me to cut back on my running/cardio to see if my heart rate will increase some. That was about a month ago.

I have since cut back on my cardio, but replaced it with weight lifting. Yesterday at my last cardiac test my resting heart rate was 41.

My doctor is aware I have lost weight. If he felt like these symptoms were partly due to my weight loss he would most likely say that, right? I am not diagnosed with an eating disorder and I am not confident I have an issue that needs medically addressed so I don't want to bring it up unless he does.

I'm still learning English.

I'd began restricting myself in food more and more from the time when i was in my late 14s. I thought I was doing everything right because I also started watching videos about food-myths, health and how food affect our bodies. And I logically was obsessed with food and was thinking of it all the time. I'm 15 right now and about a half of year ago I firstly overeat with feeling of lack of control over my actions. It wasn't a really big meal and I steel felt I had a little control over it. It was a half of cake (maybe about 1000 calories).
Then I've been starving myself for the rest of the day to make up for it. After about a week I've binged again an that time I started a cycle of binging-starving. But my binges are a bit different from others I heard stories about. I tried to track my calories even though I knew that number in my counting app was wrong because it doesn't allow you to count if you set your age under 18. Usually I track when I've just ate a big amount of cookies or other junk with no label on it so i can't normally track. And in order to not gain weight after those binges I ate very little or didn't eat at all. It was the way I turned underweight in about a year. I recognized that I might have an ED because of anxiety, obsessive thoughts and fear of gaining weight. I learned about EDs and other stuff as well. I decided to recover and began reading ""Brain over binge"" and listen to ""Brain over binge podcast"". I feel more control over the food and my thoughts but there are steel 1-3 days a week when I binge. I'm also trying to not restrict my self after the binges and I've also quit counting calories, but I can't stop constantly searching about food nutrition facts and watching nutrition labels.

I have been struggling and they don't understand that I truly am in a transitioning period (a personal term I use for ""in recovery""), eating more and being healthier. But after last nights argument, I realized again how hard it is for anyone on the outside get a glimpse of what is happening to you internally, either now, or why you have gone down this path again. Family members often see us the most, and feel the need to help because of the bond we have of being in a unit. But after my blow out last night I had to just remind myself that my parents love me and they care, they care A LOT. And its not only that, its a loving and passionate care that they have been able to control for most of my life. If you have ever felt loved and passion you know it isn't the easiest thing to control, especially when their is pain involved. 
Im not saying you have to succumb, or listen and accept what other people tell you. Just maybe realize they maybe scared and what you to be ok. They see, and know you are in pain and they realize they cant control, or don't know how to help so they just do the best the can. 
Take care of yourselves. Love yourselves and appreciate who and what you have in life, because often its what makes life worth living.

1775,dnbm6h,Request: Research,"Hi, I'm not sure how this works so forgive me if this isn't the right way to go about this post- 

I am currently conducting my dissertation eating disorders - more specifically, transdiagnostic process (perfectionsism, rigidity, dichotomous thinking) as predictors of eating disorders behaviour in subclinical populations (with emotion regulation as a moderator). I am looking for participants to undertake my online study. It is entirely questionnaire-based and comprises of the following psychometrics: 
Eating Disorder Behaviour: Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q).
ASD Traits: Autism Quotient (AQ-10)
Transdiagnostic Processes
Rigidity: Dichotomous Thinking Eating Disorder Scale (DTED-S)
Perfectionism: Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale short form (MPS-S)
Emotion Regulation: Emotional Regulation Inventory (ERI)
Disorder Specific Symptomology
OCD Traits: Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R)
Depression and Trait Anxiety: Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS)
Social Anxiety: Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS)
Self Esteem: Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES) 
As I am looking for a subclinical (not meeting all the criteria for diagnosis) with definite ED traits/behaviours, I thought this would be a great place to look for participants!
My study clearly states that no scores can be given individually, that any results from the study can not be used for diagnosis and that there are online resources if anyone feels they need them; my email address (as well as my supervisors) is clearly stated if anyone has any issues result from participation in the study.

This research is very important to me (hopefully the basis of my thesis) as I am very keen on early intervention and hope to show that early identification of those scoring highly on transdiagnostic processes and issues with emotion regulation are therefore more vulnerable to ED behaviour; hopefully research like this can then go onto to inform treatment options, as well as further research into the transdiagnostic process themselves! 

the link to my research is here: https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0B6bifIG2q9CtaR it would be so amazing if you guys could post it (or I was allowed to post, as I said im really not sure how it works)!

1776,dnbm4l,Request: I hate my body again,"The summer before my freshman year I developed an eating disorder. I think it started before that, but that’s when I distinctly remember not eating for extended periods of time. Most days I would only eat very small portions of dinner, and since my parents worked all day I didn’t have to worry about getting caught during the day. At the time I was overweight, but I didn’t care too much about it. I wasn’t eating because I was depressed, not because I hated myself. 

The summer before my sophomore year I decided I wanted to get healthy, and at this point I had a faint notion that I might have an E.D, but ignored it. I started working out and dieting severely, far below the calorie goal I needed to be at for my age, but I didn’t care. I lost weight pretty quickly and gained muscle, and people were encouraging me because they didn’t know the extent of my dieting issues. By Christmas of that year, however, I noticed that I was having increasingly worsening health issues, I was exhausted and nauseous all the time, and later I would find out that I was severely deficient in many vitamins and nutrients. 

Flash forward to this summer, and I weighed well within a normal range for my height, was only working out a few times a week instead of every night, eating a sufficient amount of calories and slowly weening off calorie charting. However when school started again, my eating schedule was thrown off, so I had to compensate by eating more in the evenings. 

At first, this worked out fine for me. I didn’t gain or lose any weight and I felt healthy, but some of the thoughts I’d had the year before started to creep back in. At the tome I was busy enough to where I could distract myself from them, but slowly over the past few months my confidence has dropped to the point where I hate seeing a mirror. I’m taking a metabolism boosting drink. Some days I eat very little and some days I eat just under what’s normal for my age and height. Ive started body checking again, I pull my fat around and I pinch myself. I hate my body again, despite not having gained or lost any weight. 

I don’t want to live like this again. I can’t put my parents through that, I can’t put my body through that, but I don’t know how to get these thoughts to stop, because every few days I have a good day, where I eat a normal amount and I’m confident in myself, but then the next day I look in the mirror and see only the worst in myself and decide I can’t eat as much to make up for it. 

I don’t know what to do, and I’m ashamed to tell anyone. I think if i start going to the gym regularly again it might help my confidence enough to where I’ll be able to eat normally, but I’m scared I’ll overdo it.",1572081877,10/26/2019 4:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dnbm4l/request_i_hate_my_body_again/,0
1777,dnbm2j,Request: Is recovery actually better? New concerns about body size,"Recovery

The good: After having AN symptoms for several years and not being able to become healthy on my own, I got treatment over the summer to help me and get me to a healthy weight. The program got me to a good weight and allowed me to meet other people like me in the same situation. After the program I stopped obsessively worrying how much I ate and when I ate and whether I was healthy or not. That was something I really wanted, to have the headspace available to think about things more important and enjoyable than eating and food.

The bad: Now, however, I have been very upset about my body size. When I had a lot of restricting I didn't worry about body size very much, but now I constantly do. I have big stretch marks from getting up to weight. I question what my weight is supposed to be because the treatment facility and my outpatient dietician didn't agree on what my ""ideal weight"" is supposed to be. Because my AN was throughout most of high school I don't think I've ever been the right size for my height and what I am now is so much different from what I am used to my body looking like. Due to my concerns about my body size I become sad a lot, hating the way I look. Now rather than worrying about food all the time I just want to cry every night. Is this recovery? Is this sadness better than my AN symptoms were? I'm worried I'll slip back into AN because I'd rather constantly be worried and on edge than sad.

A few notes: I've recently gone to college and do not have a therapist anymore. My insurance is crap for mental health and the only reason they covered the recovery program is because it was deemed ""medical"". I am currently looking to see if my college offers any better insurance or resources. I have also been really good about eating all my meals when here at school, but I'm now questioning if it is worth it because of my body size issues.",1572081867,10/26/2019 4:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dnbm2j/request_is_recovery_actually_better_new_concerns/,6
1778,dnbln4,Request: No one takes me seriously,"I have been dealing with a lot lately. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD and OCD on top of having schizoaffective disorder for the past five years. I have been rapidly losing weight since the summer. In middle school I restricted and counted calories but I was able to pull myself out with the help of therapy. Now that I am living on my own and dealing with so much, my obsession with food has become debilitating.

I have always been overweight so everyone sees my weight loss as cause for celebration instead of concern. I’m frustrated because even when I try to ask for help from healthcare/mental health professionals they ask why I’m so concerned. It jumbles things up in my head and then causes my psychotic symptoms to come into play - maybe I AM too concerned for no reason.

But then I almost pass out or cry because I have to eat in front of another person and I know it is an issue. When I say the weight loss is rapid, it truly is. 

I just feel very lost. Any advice or even positive thoughts are appreciated.",1572081795,10/26/2019 4:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dnbln4/request_no_one_takes_me_seriously/,2

I’m terrified that I’ll become complacent and “let myself go” if I recover; that if I accept my body as it is, I’ll just keep eating and eating and I won’t care because *~*~*~*my body is nourished uwu*~*~*~*

I’ve had a warped relationship with food my entire life. My mother was always hyperfocused on appearance, and the worst thing a person could be was fat. 

I think an approximate estimate of when my ED most tangibly manifested itself was when I was 10 and turned down birthday cake at a party because I was “on a diet.” Nearly 14 years later, I’m still struggling.

Sometimes at my lowest, I go on subreddits that I know will trigger me and give me reason to continue my unhealthy behaviors by enforcing my fears of becoming obese if I recover.

I think I do want to get better somewhere deep down.  I can’t afford to get a nutritionist, and I haven’t seen my therapist in over 3 months because my family’s health insurance is running out.

I finished the partial program today and i'm feeling SO much more hopeful about everything. while being there, i've had an amazing therapist and he's truly has had such a positive impact on my life. i feel like now i finally have a destination i've yet to arrive to, and i also feel like i'm in the right direction. i feel like now, i have the strength and hope to get there. today i had a family meeting and we talked a lot about my eating habits and how my mom thinks i might slowly be getting back into that pattern. but i made a promise to the both of them that i'm going to eat regularly and i'm going to stop obsessing over the excess amount of skin on my body. i'm going to stop counting calories like crazy. something that really helped me (which i always thought was absolute bullshit) is he explained to me that basically with everything i'm dealing with (depression, anxiety, ptsd) i will never be able to recover if i'm not eating right. apparently it makes your anxiety 100x worse (which explains a lot) and obviously it all drains you so much and to be honest that's something i don't miss at all about my eating disorder. i'm already tired enough as is. i'm already insecure. and i know that letting myself get back into that pattern, no matter how much i want pounds to drop as quick as possible - it's not worth it. it's the disorder talking. it's the disorder telling me i need to see those pounds shred. but me? i'm capable of this. 

today i ate a slice of pizza, a poptart, somewhat of a bagel, and two cookies. i'm really fucking proud of myself. i went from eating a piece of a pepper or clementine everyday to all of these foods i've so desperately wanted but told myself they'd make me sick. and if anybody is reading this right now, please just know you have so much going for you. watching yourself starve is only going to make you obsess more and become unhappier. making yourself throw up becomes an addiction and you feel so guilty and embarrassed after each time. binging makes you feel horrible afterwards but feels so good in the moment. but none of this is a cure to your problems. i know you feel like you don't want to get better. i'm not going to lie, i pinched my stomach after each meal today and ran to the bathroom and cried after i ate the pizza. it's so hard. but i've been on this journey for so long. on and off, on and off. and i'm hoping this is my last time. and i'm hoping this has helped someone in some sort of way. cause you are so worthy and so much more than what you see in the mirror. i promise. please just eat those chicken nuggets that smell so good but you're always so terrified to eat, or challenge yourself to smaller meals a few times a week without throwing up, or eat all the good stuff throughout the day, instead of all at once. you're going to struggle at first, believe me. but eventually, you have to break this pattern. it's not healthy. it's not supposed to be you and the disorder against everyone trying to help you. it should be you against the disorder. and i promise you - you're going to fucking win.",1572081775,10/26/2019 4:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dnblin/request_update_falling_back_into_my_disorder/,2

Hello, I hope this is allowed here. I am currently (20F) and have struggled with an ED since I was 13. I was initially diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa Restrictive Subtype but last year began abusing laxatives and diuretics so I am diagnosed as 'Purging Subtype.' I went through a six month period of severe B/P behaviors while at my lowest weight ever. Basically, I would fast all week, than plan a massive binge, than make myself purge all night. And repeated every. single. week. I was so miserable and so food obsessed. I would cook ridiculous meals like a buffet and eat until I would nearly vomit, I was torturing myself. In July, I began making some recovery efforts. Returned to my therapist, had to get stomach surgery from the damage my purging had done, and began attempting to eat more regularly. First just a solid, non restricted meal once a day, than twice, and now three times per day. My mother has been incredibly triggering and grows more angry with me at any efforts I take to further my independence. My grades and gpa have greatly improved, and as a foodie at heart, i am not only able to cook meals but portion them and eat. I have become much better at not asking for reassurance and instead assuring myself that i need to eat. My parents work a lot so I log my food via photography which i send to my best friend or therapist for support, and i even make efforts to bring snacks such as some muffins i bake, or a smoothie to school. I have deleted my calorie counters but i am not really able to eat at restaurants yet, as i dont feel mentally ready. 

My mother seems to miss my former B/P behaviors. I went through a really intense period of binging 10000+ cals per day, to the point where in july i needed hospitalization and as i mentioned earlier, a surgery due to severe bowel impaction. Sometimes, she implies that she misses these behaviors. I used to compare what I ate to her and refused to eat alone or while she worked, meaning i would wait to have dinner with her at 9 pm, usually fainting in the process or having a B/P session. She often puts down what I eat, as her and I have different likes/dislikes. I need wheat bread for my GI issues, and i tend to eat a lot of dark meat chicken which she claims is ""fattening"" which is just so triggering. I am usually hungry at much different times of day than her, like she wont eat til 1 pm where as I make breakfast at 8 am as i feel i really need a schedule. This evening for dinner we were ready to sit and eat and she said she was also going to have a bit of smoked salmon with her meal (we made lasagna). I told her i wasn't really in the mood for that and id pass. she said i NEEDED to have some. I said, ""i dont want any though. i dont make you eat foods you dont want to eat."" for example, she eats fish for dinner a few nights a week which im allergic to. i eat oats with peanut butter all the time which shes allergic to. she then told me she misses the old days when id make elaborate platters and host big dinners with the neighbors. i said ""those were binging and purging sessions. id wake up at 4 am, go for a run, than center my entire day around binging and purging. it was so painful. i dont miss any of that. i was going through a lot of pain."" apparently she sees those meals as lovely family time even though she saw how bad itd get. id throw up at the table. i was feeling tortured in my own mind. she also makes fun of my body. i wore a sports bra today and she said i looked disgusting and skeletal. i said ""im practicing body confidence. it was really hard to put this on. i was trying to feel more confident in myself instead of covering my body since its changed."" im not at my lowest weight anymore and trying to accept change. i really dont know what to do. i have mt friends and therapist in my corner encouraging me, but she is so toxic to my recovery. can anyone give me some advice?",1571997926,10/25/2019 5:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dmva69/request_mom_doesnt_acknowledge_my_recovery/,11

I am 19F and for the longest time have always hated my body and I prefer to stay below xxx pounds in weight (a weight at the low end of the normal BMI range). Whenever I go above this weight I will basically starve myself to drop back down to below said weight. 

Currently, after a very STRONG and long depressive episode, which I was heavily binge eating, I have now gotten to the point of where I’ve been starving myself, filling up fluids (mainly coffee), taking laxatives and forcing myself to throw up.

I’ve become disgusted with my body and have only been wearing baggy clothing I hide my figure because I’m not liking it. 

I’ve always been picky when it comes to food because I have more taste buds than the average human and just about everything makes me sick. For instance, as a child, my mother would have to attain banana smoothies to get the seeds out because I wouldn’t drink them if they were in their. I don’t typically eat meats cause they taste gross and are the most common for making me sick and nauseated.

I’ve just been committed to getting down to xxx pounds in any form possible which right now includes me drinking nothing but water, coffee, and tea, as well as taking laxatives and appetite suppressants. I’m obsessed with weighing myself and get pretty angry and sad whenever I see that I’m a large number away from xxx pounds

I should mention this is what I do whenever I go above xxx and usually when I’m in that range, my diet is still pretty limited (I eat like 1 meal a day).

I have sought professional treatment but their only recommendation is medication or hospitalization followed by medication. I start every day with “good intentions” and fail every time. Sometimes I have a few purge free days but as soon as I eat something that triggers me, or doesn’t sit well, the struggle to not throw it up is real. I do not allow myself to keep food which results in binges out of hunger and violent purging, sometimes 20x per day. It is horrible. Many times I also binge just purely for the comfort of eating which I also am struggling with. It is expensive and is ruining my life. 

I am active and “fit” but obsessed with every pound or day of bloating. I am exhausted and sad and anxious every day because of this problem and don’t know how to help myself.

1790,dsenc2,Request: Seeking support,"I became a lot less body conscious during my senior year of high school and I started to like my body. I was an average weight for my height, probably sitting smack in the middle of the weight range that is considered healthy for my height.

In my junior year of college I went to the doctor and they weighed me. It was the first time I’d been weighed in as long as I could remember. It was also the first time I’d seen myself drop below the xxx (a weight I was happy with). That night I joked that I was torn between wanting to keep it up, or wanting to eat an entire pizza. I guess I unintentionally “kept it up” because I continued to drop. That was the beginning of my winter semester of 2018 — January/Feb 2018.

Flash forward to my fall semester 2019, August/Septemberish, the first year I would be off of a dining hall meal plan and making my own food again. I was living further from campus but still intended to walk to class. My roommate brought a scale with her for the year. We’d roomed together for the year previously and I knew she had always been a health nut just in that she preferred to eat healthier foods. She’d snack on things like peanut butter toast or veggies of some sort as opposed to chips. But the year previous that didn’t phase me.

I continued to see the numbers drop on the scale when I started to weigh myself. I was cooking for myself again so I was making healthier foods and I was also walking roughly 25 minutes to and from campus every day (and around campus). I wanted to be as healthy as my roommate, or healthier. I wanted to be skinnier than her. It was all pretty effortless, my continuing to lose weight. My goal, that I made “for funsies” I guess was to drop below what I weighed during my freshman year of high school when I finally quit gymnastics after nine years. I managed to do that before winter even came.

Flash forward to April, I had dropped, and for the most part maintained, my below-freshman year-weight. And then I broke up with my then boyfriend of two years. I lost more weight during the first week after the breakup because I had no appetite. It was an amicable breakup with one of my best friends (we were friends even before we dated for two years) and so it was terribly sad to say goodbye. After that, I made it my goal to stay below my breakup weight. For the most part, I have.

It was never to the point where I’d restrict and feel totally anxious until June, and that was a slow and steady development. In June, I would still eat out and I would, every now and then, enjoy days where I just guiltlessly ate like shit. Now, I find it difficult to do either. In August, I found out that only a month and a half after my ex and I broke up, he was already in a new relationship. I was absolutely heartbroken and the comparisons I started making to a hypothetical girl are what eventually drove me to where I’m at now. I thought “does she have a better body? Is she prettier? What does she look like?” I wanted to be thinner than ever before so that if I ever saw my ex again (somewhat unlikely if not a planned event b/c we did distance) he’d say “damn, she glowed up.”

I started going for runs more frequently. I wouldn’t entirely restrict but I would somewhat. Now, November 4th, I feel bad for having eaten more calories than my BMR. For reference, I work retail full time — I’m on my feet 8 hours a day AND I go for a run (sometimes, schedule permitting) either before or after work. Whether I run one or two miles depends on how bad I feel about what I ate during the day. Anyway, case in point, I should be eating AT LEAST my BMR’s calorie intake because I am by no means sedentary. And I feel so bad if I do that.

I want fast food. Like, just a four piece chicken nugget or something. I want tortilla chips with salsa. I want to buy a pack of Oreos. I have begun to feel embarrassed even going grocery shopping because I won’t buy foods over a certain calorie content which really restricts a lot of what I could buy. So there I am, standing in the grocery store, meandering about (sometimes aimlessly) flipping the packaging over and checking the calorie count per serving, often times putting the item back and walking further to see if I can find something with less calories.

This is such a lonely experience on top of depression and bipolar II disorder that is especially bad this year when I am a recent college grad, working full time retail with my “worthless social science degree” while all of my friends are still students, my ex is with a new girl (and the breakup was still less than a year ago as it is) and I practically don’t even know any of my housemates. I recently got my wisdom teeth out and I thought “I’ll use ‘only soft foods’ as another opportunity to lose more weight.”

I don’t even know why I’m posting this — I think it’s because at this point I’m so sad and lonely and I just want to say this to someone. I also just want some food and I can’t even bring myself to eat. At this point, I can’t think of anything that actually sounds good. The idea of endless chicken nuggets sounds excellent, but the knowledge that I would indeed feel full afterwards sounds horrible. I don’t know what feeling full feels like anymore. Only bloated. And my constant bloating from my constant undereating makes the cycle worse.

My therapist and doctor have asked if I want to see a nutritionist and I told them both that I’m not ready to explain this to my parents. That is true - I’m not. But I’m also not ready to stop this for myself. I’m not ready to see my stomach and body go back to what it looked like at this time last year, or the year before that. I just wish I could go back to when this wasn’t even a thought. I want to go back to a time where I could eat pizza, like three or four slices, while drinking a beer without even paying mind to it. I want to do all that and know also that I’m still, like, appealing to men and have some sort of sex appeal",1573037323,11/6/2019 4:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dsenc2/request_seeking_support/,4

1793,dsekwq,Request: What is normal eating supposed to be like?,"I’m recovering from eating issues (at first it was anorexia and then weird diet restrictions, wayyy over exercising for years, and the past few it’s been purging but no binging and I stopped working out a lot in June) and I literally don’t know what normal eating is supposed to be like.

I have an appointment with a dietitian in a few weeks and in a couple months I’m going to do outpatient treatment so I will get guidance soon but until then I don’t know what I should be shooting for.

Googling what to eat recovery is confusing. 3 meals a day? AND snacks? Snacks plural? I’m used to making myself wait until dinner time to eat and then purging half of it. Maybe a light lunch occasionally. I’m trying to eat 3 meals and it is really hard. I don’t feel hungry yet for breakfast or lunch, and then I feel so much guilt for eating those meals when I don’t feel hungry yet. I start feeling really hungry around 2:30pm and my stomach goes nuts all growly and hungry and then if I wait an hour I don’t feel hungry anymore. 

What is normal eating supposed to look like? I feel like it should be something like “eat when you’re hungry” whenever that is, but my hunger cues are all out of wack. 

So should it be structured? Based on specific times of day? Because if that’s the case, it’s one more thing for me to over obsess on and I fall in the negative panic attack depression cycle for being off the schedule. 

And how do I know how much to eat? Is my metabolism a great deal slower from damage? Or just a little bit?

If anybody wants to weigh in on advice, explanations, tips, random facts, personal opinions, conspiracy theories, recipes, macro guides, or knock knock jokes, please feel free. I’d really appreciate it.

1794,drxhon,Request: Anybody else experienced PTSD caused BY an eating disorder?," 

This weekend marked 1 year into anorexia recovery for me.

About 5 or 6 months into my recovery I started experiencing PTSD symptoms, which I am now treating the ptsd with exposure therapy and emdr.

I feel traumatised by my time with anorexia, it includes flashbacks and body memories of the scariest times during restriction during my recovery and I was scared for a while that even though I physically recovered I'd be reliving the experience forever and ever.

So I wondered, has anyone else experienced anything similar? Is it normal for an ED to trigger ptsd in someone? I really thought that i would just have to heal from the ED itself.

Whenever I Google stuff I can only find things about how PTSD causes ED and not the other way round so I'd love some insight, and if anyone can relate

My mother has struggled with bulimia since she was in her 20s, meaning that for my entire life my mother has been bulimic. I love my mother and at times when she was doing well she was a wonderful mother. But her disorder was mostly challenging throughout my development and has negatively impacted my relationship with her and the dynamic in our otherwise loving family. In a nutshell, it has been incredibly difficult being her daughter.

For the last ten years or so I’ve searched high and low for a support system, outside of my family, who understands my experiences.

1813,dqz93v,Request: Struggle with binging and undermining progress in gym," 

TLDR; I struggle with binging and am undermining my progress in the gym (though I enjoy exercise for exercise’s sake, haha).

hi everyone, this is my first post, dunno if anyone will even read it but here goes!

I’ve struggled with my weight since childhood and with binging and other disordered behavior (hiding food, eating in secret, spending way too much money on binge food, etc; I dabbled with purging, too, but I’m not bulimic, it was only a few attempts) since I was a teen.

in the summer of 2018, I got to my lowest adult weight - Still overweight for my 5’3’’ but not obese. I felt like I had my eating under control, I still indulged once in a while but I actually had some structure in my meals (if not a meal plan). (As opposed to binge days where I just eat what I find or buy whatever I want)

Since then, I’ve had to have two long hospital stays - of course with very little exercise (plus shitty hospital food which I compensated for by buying candy); as well as some mental health issues, which I tried to “heal” by comfort eating. Then starting uni again has been stressful, which lead to me if not outright binging, definitely overeating more than ever. ALL THIS MEANS that I gained weight since my lowest, and am now close to my HIGHEST adult weight (obese) 😞

THE GOOD NEWS. I am going to the gym pretty often and I signed up for the weightlifting club. Apart from lifting (still a wee beginner though!) in the gym I run or walk in an incline on the treadmill. I really enjoy lifting, and my teammates are very nice and happy to help. But I feel like I’m undermining my progress if I eat shitty food full of carbs and little protein. It’s like I’m doing the hard work in the gym for nothing. Rationally, I know all of this. But I feel like I’m on autopilot - I’ve been binging/overeating for a month almost every day, and I feel like I’m stuck.

I'm at a normal weight for my height (middle of BMI range), and to be honest I have been using exercise as a tool for my recovery from anorexia, so I honestly have no idea what 'real' eating looks like for a person like me.
All I do know is I'm ravenous all the time.  Now that I'm trying to dial back on exercise (still working out daily, but just 1 session, and working on shortening it), I fear that my food consumption (or rather hunger) is accelerating, and my fear is putting back on all the weight from when I was younger and this whole spiral started.
I know I have to change, I'm always exhausted, irritable, and  have little patience for my wife (and children), but at the same time I can't calm the voice in my head that urges me to go run off the extra snack I had in the day.

1819,dq1wty,Request: I have a complicated relationship with food and don’t know how to navigate it. (24 F),"For context, my parents always fed me, I always had lots to eat growing up, and would say I was raised to have a good relationship with food.

As I’ve gotten older (24 now), I go in phases in my eating. There are 2 ways my eating habits shift:

1) I hoard food. When I’m at other peoples houses eating, I panic when making a plate that I’m not going to have enough to eat and pile my plate as full as possible because I can’t stand the thought of not being full. But I’m also very embarrassed to load a full plate because I don’t want people to know what I’m doing. It’s like I almost have an anxiety attack at the thought of possibly not having enough to eat, even if there is a reasonable amount of food to grab from. This mainly happens with unhealthy foods, heavy carbs, fast food, etc.

This also comes out in times of stress or sadness. I will resort to making/ ordering extreme amount of food, and will binge it all in one sitting. The food is never thrown up, but it feels like I use it as a form of punishment/ comfort. 

2) I skip meals/ diet secretly. I will mainly skip breakfast and lunch because no one is around to see me miss it. Or I will skip all forms of carbs and almost exclusively eat fruits and vegetables.  By doing this I feel thinner therefore feel more attractive.

These 2 habits have ramped up in the last year and I’m not sure how to maintain a steady diet. It’s either one extreme or the other and I can’t specifically figure out what causes either of these swings. Is any of this an eating disorder? Or am I just poorly managing my stress? I’m not even sure what to call what I’m doing.

Thank you if you took the time to read all of this.",1572600748,11/1/2019 4:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dq1wty/request_i_have_a_complicated_relationship_with/,0

Ive taken various medications over the years for adhd and anxiety that supress my appetite which didnt help. My mom warned my dr that I dont eat much before going on the medications so my dr is constantly threatening to take me off if i lose too much weight between visits. Just a few months ago I lost 6 pounds within a week due to not eating.

The reason I'm posting this now is because multiple times a week I go until dinnertime without eating, then feel sick. Ill get weird painful stomach aches and im scared ill get a stomach ulcer!! When this happens its actually hard to eat despite knowing how hungry and malnourished i am.. is there anything i can do to make myself hungry? If anyone has any insight or tips i would really appreciate it♡",1572600738,11/1/2019 4:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dq1wru/request_do_i_have_an_eating_disorder/,6

I recently experienced a relapse in my ED (mainly AN symptoms) and my heart rate is fluctuating all over the  place. At rest it hovers between 69-73 bpm but any time I stand up I jump to 90-100 bpm. I got a fitbit HR a  few months ago after having psychogenic seizures from PTSD, which triggered my OCD and ED resurfacing. That’s how I can monitor my bpm so closely. 

I have been experiencing a lot of lightheadedness and some chest pain when my heart rate spikes.

1831,dvq2zd,Request: My family has a history of eating disorders and I’m worried about developing one.,"I know I’m probably overreacting, but my mum had an eating disorder that nearly killed her which started very similarly to what’s happening to me at the moment, and other family members have also suffered with other disorders. First, I should probably explain a bit about myself I guess:

I’ve never really been happy with my appearance, but it’s never been something that’s bothered me. I’ve been gaining weight for years, as I’ve never had any interest in losing it, but earlier this year I began starting to lose weight slowly as I am overweight and was worried about my health. My family have been worried about it for years, but they’ve always been careful to not try to pressure me into trying to lose weight after my mother gave herself an eating disorder back in the 1980’s.

I started aiming to be a small amount under the recommended calorie intake, nothing serious, and it was working, I was slowly losing weight. And I was fine. But then in September, I started struggling a lot with my mental health, (anxiety, all the symptoms of depression, that sort of thing.) and it only feels like it’s mostly better now, nearly 2 months after it started. But that’s not important.

What is important is that during that period of 2 months, I suddenly started to care about what other people thought about me. For the first time, my weight mattered for more than just long term health implications. So I cut all snacks out of my diet. And I was happier, at first. Although my mental health was through the floor, I felt a bit better since I knew that if I lost weight I wouldn’t hate my appearance much.

But then it started getting worse. I was still slowly losing weight, but it felt like it wasn’t fast enough. I was ugly, it was bad for my health, I should lose it faster. One day, I didn’t each lunch. This wasn’t just because I wanted to lose weight, part of it was that I just couldn’t see any point in bothering to eat.

But then something surprised me. There was like this voice, except it wasn’t a voice, it was a thought in my mind, but it felt like a voice as I wasn’t choosing to think it. It was telling me that what I was doing was good. And I should do it more. I was a little confused, this was new, I’d never had anything like it before. But the next day, I listened to it and didn’t have any lunch.

And it was like the voice got louder, the thought got stronger. “This is good.”, I thought, and continued doing it. But then after a while, the thought changed, it wasn’t just telling me I should skip lunch, it was telling me I shouldn’t eat breakfast either. I started coming up for excuses as to how I could avoid it, even though my family would notice if I didn’t eat it.

But then I thought, no, this is how eating disorders start, and ignored it. But the thought was still there, telling me what I should be doing. I started eating smaller meals, but still having breakfast and dinner. One day, I felt really ill during my dinner, so I only ate a little bit of it, despite having no lunch. And then I went to bed, and woke up the next morning. But I woke up late, so I had an excuse not to eat breakfast. So I didn’t. And then I didn’t eat anything until lunchtime, and that was only because my family were with me.

The scary part is though, it felt like what I was doing was good. I was painfully hungry, my stomach hurt and ached, but it felt good. I felt like I was doing the right thing, and I should keep going. It wasn’t just because I wanted to avoid being unhealthy, I had to keep losing weight. It felt like I had to keep going.

But I stopped myself. I realised what I was doing was stupid. That’s how my mother ended up in hospital. Since then, it’s been about a week. My mental health has improved a lot, but that thought/voice thing is still there, it’s quieter, but still there. It’s still telling me that I shouldn’t be eating, after each meal it tells me I’m doing a bad thing and that I should stop. I don’t like it.

The really scary part is that it still sounds like it’s giving me good advice. I am overweight, and I should try to lose it. I want to listen to it. But I’m just worried that this is going to turn into something worse if I leave it, just like it surprised my mum when she went from going swimming once a week to hundreds of pushups each day.

I don’t know what I should do. Is this the start of eating disorder? Am I doing the right thing by ignoring it? I just don’t know. If it wasn’t for my family’s history, I wouldn’t be bothering posting this... but if I am starting to develop something I want to stop it before it becomes any worse.",1573642121,11/13/2019 4:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dvq2zd/request_my_family_has_a_history_of_eating/,1

Hi [r/EatingDisorders](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/),

I am a Master’s student at Georgia Tech conducting research with Dr. Munmun De Choudhury in the Social Dynamics and Wellbeing Lab.

We would like to know how you reflect on your eating disorder, the treatment you are receiving, and your interactions with people who support you in your recovery. As part of our study, we aim to develop tools that can aid individuals in their eating disorder treatment by understanding how they reflect on their condition. Your recovery story is very beneficial to accurately and effectively develop these tools that can help thousands.

We aim to conduct interviews that would last approximately 30 to 60 minutes remotely and online. You must have a current DSM-5 defined diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, have been receiving treatment for at least 6 months, are active on social media, and are at least 15 years old.

If you would like to participate in this study, please email [edreflectionproject@gmail.com](mailto:edreflectionproject@gmail.com). You will be compensated up to $20 in an Amazon gift card for your participation.

If you have any questions about our work, please feel free to contact me, and I would be happy to provide you with more information.

1836,dv8g2j,Request: Concerned about my friend," 

hi everyone, i am growing increasingly concerned for my friend (M20) and i’m wondering if he could possibly have an eating disorder. he’s extremely extremely underweight, to the point where his bmi would consider him emancipated. he has always been skinny but he just keeps losing weight and he only eats about once a day. the food he does eat is usually super sugary and fatty, he just doesn’t eat a lot of it. he has stated before that when he feels hungry, he just ignores the feeling, and when he does eat he gets full after just a couple of bites.

i guess i’m wondering if it’s possible for someone as skinny as him to just be naturally that thin or if he could potentially have an eating disorder. i’m honestly surprised his doctors have never mentioned anything about it (as far as i know) because it could cause a lot of health problems and i’m so worried for him.

we were in a romantic relationship together for over a year and we were open about everything (including my own ednos) but this is the one thing i was always scared to ask him about because i didn’t want to hurt his feelings. we’re still really close friends and i know it’s none of my business but i’m just curious if he does have an eating disorder how i could help him. thank you",1573556271,11/12/2019 4:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dv8g2j/request_concerned_about_my_friend/,5

1838,dv8fdr,Request: How can I help a close friend with an ED?,"Hello everyone,

A little bit of background: A very close friend of mine suffers from anorexia. Over the past year her ED had really worsened to the point where she was taken to a hospital. Over that time, she did become steadily better and even gained a little bit of weight back! However, over the past month she has begun to relapse, unfortunately, with slightly different habits. She eats more normally and consistently now due to her recent treatment (although she still eats very little compared to others), but the food she does eat she will purge relatively soon after. To make things slightly more complicated, she’s recently moved halfway across the world to finish her degree, so we no longer regularly see each other. 

On a good note, she recognizes that she’s relapsing and has made the necessary appointments to meet with a new doctor and psychotherapist. I love her very much and want to support her as much as I can.

So my question: How can I help my friend from a distance and be supportive without necessarily becoming overbearing or triggering etc.? Are there any good specific materials/books I could read or watch? What are the best ways to ask how she’s doing without seeming intrusive? If she is not doing well, what are some healthy ways I can motivate her to eat and not purge? Basically, I’m very worried about her and want to help!

I would consider myself very inexperienced with ED and have never experienced one myself nor the likes of it. So, I’m pretty clueless on how to really approach the subject well in regards to what’s triggering and what’s not, especially at a long distance. Basically, what are some fundamental things I should know to really help someone with a relapsing ED?

1846,duknk8,Request: Relapse after the stomach flu,"I recently had a really bad bout of the stomach flu which has made my stomach extremely sensitive to any kind of food I put in it. Frequent vomiting is now an issue I face. It’s caused me to lose a substantial amount of weight. Before this, I was gaining weight back, eating better and recovering. Now, my stomach has shrunk so I’m hardly able to eat and I’m still navigating what my stomach will reject and what it’ll accept. 
It’s been about two weeks since I had the stomach flu, but I’m still vomiting regularly. I just checked my weight and it is significantly lower than my cut-off weight, which is the weight my boyfriend said he’d hospitalize me at.

He also told me once that people who weigh this little “look disgusting” and I’m afraid he’s not going to be attracted to me after he finds out how little I weigh.

I have no idea what to do here. I can’t see an eating disorder specialist because the only one who takes my insurance around here has deferred me repeatedly. 

Does anyone have any advice for me in this situation?

1847,duknhp,Request: Extremely hungry and afraid that any possible meal plan is going to be too restrictive.,"I am struggling through a restrictive ED relapse which has been going on for several months. I am underweight, albeit not that much, and I am suffering both physical and psychological symptoms. Cold all the time, unable to concentrate, obsessive and ritualistic, fatigued, etc. You know the usual stuff.

The single worst symptom though is extreme hunger. I have been this hungry only during the very worst phases of the eating disorder. The hunger is absolutely wild and uncontrollable and often keeps me awake at night. The thoughts about food are so loud that I want to cry. Sometimes I can't tolerate them anymore so I snap and binge, and during these binges the only limit is my stomach capacity - I can easily eat thousands of kcal in a single sitting and never feel satisfied. Ever. I am not exaggerating.

In a few days I will be seeing a new dietitian (as well as a new therapist) and I guess he/she will probably prescribe me a meal plan. My concern, though, is that a meal plan is just not going to be enough.

See, right now I only make one meal a day and try to make it as large as possible. I am not going to share the exact caloric amount - it's not extremely low and, while still being less than what a normal person eat during a day, it's still enough to survive and not lose anymore weight. And I am already FORCING myself to eat that amount, having to deal with the horrible guilt that comes afterwards. This arrangement is the best way I have found to get some satisfaction.

By the way, this meal not only includes protein but also a decent amount of fat. It's been very very hard to bring back some fat into it because I kept telling myself ""why do you have to choose the full-fat option when you could have the low-fat one, eat more of it and save calories?"", but over time I've come to grow more comfortable over it. I know I need to eat fat, so I try to force myself to do it even though I don't want to.

I guess a meal plan will include ""normal"" meals. Yet normal meals feel insultingly small to me. I wouldn't even see them as a snack. Anything smaller than huge is completely useless, it would just make me feel worse because not only I would have my fears validated (""see, you have to restrict, the very dietitian tells you that with this meal plan!"") and wouldn't get even the tiny satisfaction I get now from my large evening meal, but I also wouldn't have the safe blanket of being under a certain caloric amount. Basically it would be a shitshow from a psychological and physiological standpoint.

Plus, it's like anytime I eat outside that evening meal the floodgates open and I get even MORE hungry. My brain starts screaming ""omg there's food. Let's get ALL of it RIGHT NOW."" and so a. Either I get even more scared of eating during the day or b. I binge.

Yet I realize that I need some help, and can't just persist in these behaviours. I also am aware that some of this hunger is due to the fact that the eating disorder has completely destroyed my hunger cues. But the last time I've tried to speak to my dietitian(s) about this extreme hunger I've mostly been met with poor empathy, if not contempt, or at best with a simple ""having normal consistent meals will make that go away"". Yeah, it might happen in the long run, but what do I do in the meantime? How can I stick to the meal plan, which is going to be restrictive for what I want right now, and not go crazy and/or ending up binging in the meantime?

1857,du406l,Request: Really need support.,"Hello. I was a healthy, but relatively high weight 3-4 months ago. I just came back from vacation and was at my highest weight. Then, I saw a video of someone trying out a diet and documenting their results and it really motivated me. I wanted to lose weight so bad ! And I did, I rarely had breakfast, small lunch or just fruit and maybe soup for dinner. I was getting results and I loved it ! I felt much more beautiful and confident. I didn't even yo-yo much for whatever reason. I counted calories and didn't eat enough..  I weighed myself pretty much every day. Luckily, (according to BMI,) I was never underweight. However, I'm a teenage girl and suspect that malnutrition has been sabotaging my growth. I'm pretty short and while that could also be my genes, I feel like my body really isn't getting enough vitamins etc. I feel so bad when I have breakfast because it feels like a waste of calories and I sometimes chew on food that's high in calories only to spit it back out again. (I've never made myself throw up!) Besides being so scared that I'll always have an unhealthy relationship with food, my friends are worried about me. I know that I look thin, but not unhealthy (meagre?). And it's not just a delusion, people who I share a locker room with have confirmed that. I'm just terrified that others will think I look too skinny and unhealthy under the oversized clothes I wear and think of me as unlovable and ugly when I'm just thin... It feels like I did something wrong for having body image issues. But it's not my fault, is it? I'm the one suffering here.. And my mom even noticed it, she's stunned. She was really happy about my weightloss. I know that you guys can't diagnose me with an eating disorder or anything, but how bad is my situation right now?

1863,dtdx8p,Request: I [23F] feel ashamed when my gf [22F] eats candy around me,"Hello all,

I have disordered eating that's not one specific kind of thing (restriction, binging, types of foods, etc). Recently with Halloween, we had a lot of candy in the house. I've also been depressed. I binged a lot and felt ashamed. I'd do it mostly when my partner was out but due to misophonia I'd then also have some when she was cronching candy to keep the noise of her eating from bothering me.

The other day I mentioned that I felt like I'd been eating a lot more candy than her and I asked her if I should stop and leave her the rest (hindsight: not a good Q) in fairness. She paused for a minute and then awkwardly said yes. Since then, whenever she eats candy I've been feeling really bad and ashamed about myself, about binging, and I've needed to leave the room, usually going into my bedroom to cry and lay in bed for a few hours. I don't think she's put 2 and 2 together because I've just generally been depressed. I think part of why I'm feeling bad is because I can see the bowl of candy and know how much is left and it just makes me realize how much I binged in just a few days, and it will last her weeks.

How can I talk to my girlfriend about the reaction I'm having to her eating the candy around me? I think I already make her feel bad about eating around me with my misophonia (though chewing gum helps, I have IBS so it can trigger that) and I don't want her to somehow feel like she's doing something wrong. I don't want her to develop a bad relationship with food because of trying to accommodate my misophonia and disordered eating or feeling bad because of the effect it has on me... But I also feel like I should talk to her about this because there's got to be some solution that won't make her feel bad but won't trigger me either.

TL;DR my gf eating her share of the leftover candy reminds me of my binge and eating my entire share already, I feel ashamed, and idk how to talk to her about this really specific trigger without making her feel like she's done something wrong",1573211213,11/8/2019 5:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dtdx8p/request_i_23f_feel_ashamed_when_my_gf_22f_eats/,0

1869,dtdw4m,Request: request: How to deal with a friends ED impacting your own growth &amp; ways to help?,"So I have a best friend who has an eating disorder an I found out about half a year ago. It really saddens me but is equaling very frustrating for me as I’ve never truly experienced an ED so I get confused on what to do &amp; I want to help but it’s so complex.

I myself have had &amp; still do fight many mental problems so I’ve always been understanding &amp; relate to similar struggles. But I have only had slight symptoms of an ED before, I think. When at my worst times of depression an darkness I’ve lost a lot of weight and refused to eat an it was rough but It improved with time (it was a breakup that caused it) . I also have had worse body image issues myself but have made a lot of progress and recovery mentally this year. My self love has sort of blossomed on its path to healing an lately I’ve just been determined &amp; doing a lot better then ever, accepting things and growing. still fighting hard &amp; hurting and have lots more to work on ofc...

..But anyways her situation is so much different and far more serious. Some months back she had to be admitted to a hospital because her weight got that low. And I’m so afraid for her ever since. I’ve done a lot of research the past few months because I was afraid of my word choice &amp; triggering her etc. I wanna be a safe spot for her, I don’t wanna make it harder for her. I’m known to be too intense and passionately opinionated sometimes so that’s why I’m even more worried of doing something wrong that could damage her. Im sensitive but equally brutal. It’s why I also have a hard time with friends in general. 

So far I’ve just been emotionally supporting her, telling her I’m there if she wants to talk or needs anything. I haven’t really commented on the weight itself &amp; about eating, obviously prob wouldn’t be a good idea. I’ve been positive &amp; telling her how I like her soul &amp; subtly trying to help her with self love etc. I compliment her a lot and always remind her why I love her. Making her laugh &amp; just talking about other things &amp; stuff like that. I think that’s my best option so far for her to know she’s not alone..

But I’m not a therapist you know? There’s only so much I can do. And I don’t wanna make her go backwards &amp; accidentally hurt her. I hate to watch her go downhill but only she is truly in control of whether she wants to get better. I can help to an extent but if she isn’t ready what can I do but watch her suffer?? It hurts to see my friend this way an I’m the type of person who always feels there’s more than can be done. In this case it’s like I’m in a cage with no control. 

She has a boyfriend who supports &amp; loves her everyday, &amp; she has some other friends who do the same &amp; that reassures me more. But she tells me she’s mostly vegetarian kinda up &amp; down on it. &amp; I respect her diet. But deep down I feel like it’s even worse for her ED, eating such limited foods &amp; being at such a low weight. Obv I won’t comment or stop her but that’s another worry on my long list of worries I guess.

She sends me pics &amp; videos sometimes of her craving chocolate &amp; sweets etc &amp; she will send me pics of tasty food she’s eating sometimes which makes me happier sort of. But there’s something so confusing even more to me. I don’t know what’s normal or not with this disorder like I’m still learning..

Literally every morning I’ll get some type of self hate text or some kind of joke of her saying like “I can’t weight to lose 20 more pounds today” or “I wish I looked like this” &amp; sends me a pic of this disturbingly small photoshopped girls. Like she follows all these unrealistic models who clearly have EDs as well. I’m not super informed on the topic but I think I read that some people look at pro-ED stuff in a way they think helps them? 

It’s scary as her friend to see that but I guess her mindset is just in some broken patterns?? I feel not educated enough but in a way im veryyy exhausted too. I have put so much time into learning but her negativity is slowing down my own progress. Like for example just every single time she sends me memes or we’re having a conversation she’ll randomly say like “I’m gonna lose so much weight today” or like “I am so ugly lol” &amp; even when I post body pics of myself on snap or whatever, she’ll  comment and get all sad saying “ I need to not eat today.” And that makes me really sad ...I feel guilty when I try to be proud of myself because she just keeps making those self loathing jokes. SO MUCH. I keep telling her as carefully as I can how making the self damaging jokes stops healing and makes it hurt more. 

She’s aware of the problem &amp; in her mind wants to fix it but I haven’t seen her take any action into doing so?? Like no joke every single day when I wake up to the negativity I will send her paragraph after paragraph or voice texts on why I like how she looks &amp; why I care about her. I tell her she deserves to heal and be caring to herself. 

But part of me feels that she wants the attention more than growth itself. Hearing her put herself down day &amp; night is putting my own mind in a backwards mindset. I’m slowly starting to say these things to myself again because she says it THAT much. Which is so bad for me because I’ve battled self hate for years. I can’t have that kind of energy around...but I still care for her..I just need to take my own happiness into consideration as well. 

&amp; when I say everyday I mean every single god damn day. I try so hard to be there &amp; bring her up but she won’t even try to stop being less negative in the SLIGHTEST. I give her little ideas everyday like being grateful &amp; mindful &amp; having self care days &amp; saying kind words to your mind. She never listens, an I never force her. I always come about it in an open way &amp; that it’ll all her choice. 

It got to a point where I told her it’s impacting me &amp; that I need her to at least please not send the self hate snaps to me every morning. I suggested like sending it with something different &amp; more positive or talking about other stuff. But she won’t stop at all. I have been extremely patient &amp; helpful but I’m just getting really mad at this point. I don’t show it but it gets infuriating because I ask her to please not send me the self attacking jokes so much &amp; she doesn’t even consider what I say. She just does it over &amp; over &amp; over. &amp; it’s entraining back into my mind, it’s like everyday I have to undo the energy she casted onto me to get back to where I was. 

The weirder part is that when I don’t compliment her &amp; send her those paragraphs, she gets like lowkey upset? Like she will send more &amp; more until I acknowledge it &amp; everything. Recently I’ve just been changing the topic when she says it &amp; trying to completely distract her but my efforts are useless it feels like. 

My heart gets really firey &amp; aggressive when I can’t come to solutions so I’m in fear for what I’m gonna say soon lol. I have a giant heart but I get pretty heartless &amp; sick of helping when they won’t even try or make ANY effort :( it’s like she wants to stay in that sick cycle because if she doesn’t people won’t give her that attention?! I’m so lost tbh. I don’t even know. It’s gotten my mind building this bad frustration towards her. When they won’t even cooperate in the slightest but force me to hear their endless negativity, it’s enraging. 

I love her but she’s draining my energy and killing my vibe really reallllly bad. At this rate I’m gonna completely spiral into my past self. Am I wrong to feel this resentment deep down for her now? my brain just wants to tell her to shut up and decide to change or she will be stuck there forever. I won’t say that but ugh...I feel guilty but I just can’t freakin take it. I can’t support someone who wants to stay where they are...

Should I distance from her until she’s ready to heal more? I will help her everyday for infinity if I have to but I don’t wanna lose myself along the way and I feel as if I am .... :(

1874,dtduqu,Request: help?,"



Hi guys, I haven't posted here before but I need someone's help :) I am preparing to have my teeth repaired from many years of purging, as I had quit a long time ago when I started my family. Unfortunately for me I started gaining weight after that, and obviously my fiance fell out of love because she wasn't attracted to me anymore (I'm definitely never letting that happen ever again in my lifetime) and I guess she felt stuck with me because we had kids. Well in 2017 she took them away from me and moved across the country to live with someone else and I started again, partially to cut weight because I had obviously become too gross to be around but also as a form of self destruction. I tend to get that way when my life destructs.

Anyway that's the backstory so you can understand that this is real and I have a real reason for needing help. I am working on a better body right now because I am tired of being all alone, and have an appointment to get my back teeth fixed as all 4 of the farthest back ones are damaged from the acid (I was bulimic for many years throughout high school and my first marriage before I met my ex and had kids) and I have to lose weight fast but I can't purge anymore due to getting my teeth fixed. I need a support community for other forms of quick weight loss and figured this would be a good place to come asking. I know at least a few of you will be able to direct me to what I need, any sub or even communities elsewhere on the internet are okay just so long as I have people to talk to who understand my path and to pressure me into not fucking up. PM me if you don't feel comfortable posting a particular site or sub here. Thanks. I am beyond desperate to get my old body back, each second in this skin feels disgusting and humiliating.",1573210791,11/8/2019 4:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dtduqu/request_help/,1

1876,dz0dhm,Request: Who should I ask for help?,"Hi. 

I'm a 30-year old woman. I have a problem with binge eating, and I need help. I've been on various diets and counted calories in the past, but I think that's making the frequency and severity of binges worse (helped initially, but the behaviors came back with a vengeance and now I can't seem to stop). I want to seek professional help to develop a better relationship with food, especially because I have an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and hypothyroidism due to polycystic ovary syndrome and family history. Unfortunately there are some complicating factors - my husband (who has good intentions, so please don't attack him) hounds me about counting calories constantly and he doesn't even know about my binging. His constant nagging about my eating habits has caused me a lot of stress, resentment, and guilt. I also know that the binging is likely based on childhood issues. 

I'm not sure who to ask for help - a counselor, or a dietitian. Unfortunately my insurance doesn't cover any eating disorder specialists that work with diet AND therapy, and an intensive outpatient or inpatient treatment facility isn't possible due to my work schedule and home responsibilities. I am also worried about telling my husband about wanting to seek help, because I think he sees it as a personal failing (and sees my struggle with weight as a lack of discipline), and will just tell me I need to count calories because ""it worked before"". I want to fix these bahaviors before I develop a serious health issue such as diabetes or my mobility is affected. Weight loss isn't my primary goal, I am actually happy with my body - just concerned about my health in the future. Does anyone have experience struggling with binge eating, and if you sought professional help, what kind of specialist did you see?

1877,dykzzt,Request: I don’t know how to explain things to my boyfriend,"First off, I’m sorry for the long post. 

Me and him have been together for a little over a year. I have a tattoo that has the NEDA symbol on it and I’ve explained it once but essentially just said “NEDA heart” and he didn’t question it so I didn’t say the acronym and it’s been over a year since then. 

But I feel like a dirty liar not saying anything. I just don’t know how to bring it up and I don’t know how to explain it. I’ll say this ED was “active” (I was participating in disordered eating behaviors) for about 10 years of my life. I’ve been passive or in recovery for about 2 years where I have thoughts but I’m not acting on them. So as you see and you know having an ED has been a huge part of my life and influenced a lot of the decisions I made which got me where I am today.

I guess part of the reason I’m antsy about telling him right now is 2 things:

1. Last week he mentioned a celebrity pic one of his friends shared on FB and friend said something along the lines of thick girls are hot ( I cringed writing this). My boyfriend said he thought this celebrity wasn’t particularly attractive to him and also said she was too skinny anyway. So I went “you don’t like thinner girls.” And said “not like that.” So I’m not sure if he just told me I’m fat or if he thinks I’m unattractive. I didn’t say anything after and the subject changed. But I can’t stop thinking about it.

2. Thanksgiving. 

I’m sure this holiday is probably complicated for most of the users here. My family doesn’t really acknowledge that I’ve had an ED, but that’s something to unpack another time. I want to have dinner with my family because I feel more comfortable eating in front of them, and additionally one of the elderly members of my family is having a heart issue. His parents have never met me either so there’s also that. He’s invited me to his thanksgiving, but I don’t want to go because of the above reasons. Plus I know if I go I’ll be so nervous I won’t eat anything and feel so rude for not eating anything but really, really, really badly don’t want to eat in front of them.

I know he really wants me to meet his parents because he’s very close to them so I feel like such a disappointment for turning down his mom’s invitation when the truth behind is “sorry I can’t go, I’m too terrified to eat in front of your family”

I’ve only really been able to explain my ED to my old counselor since her literal job is to listen to my feelings to council me and in writing or drawing.

Another few things about how I don’t know how to approach is I’ve talked about having anxiety and going to counseling and he’s answered “it seems like a lot of girls I know have anxiety.” And also about how he was starving on our first date and I was hungry too but he knew I would barely eat because “girls never eat in front of guy.” Even those two things have made me shutdown telling him about having an ED because they’re a lot deeper than what he thinks. 

I just feel bad not saying anything and getting upset because how could he even know? I don’t know how to open up about it and be honest without having him look at me differently and worry about me and having him know the horrible mess of things I’ve done to myself.

1878,dy1iy6,Request: How to speak to my boyfriend about my ED,"I have only spoken to a few people about my ED, but it's difficult to get those who don't struggle with an ED to understand your perspective and attitudes towards food.
I have spoken to my boyfriend about my ED and am currently in the middle of receiving treatment, however it still sucks. He always tries to be as supportive as he can be, and I appreciate that, but I cannot help but feel bad for him having to deal with me and my issues, is that normal?
I've been with him for about a year, so my ED is still a recently new thing for him to get his head around which makes sense. But I'm so conscious of scaring him away with the honest reality of what I'm dealing with. He's spoken about previous relationships and having to deal with mental health issues and has always expressed an understanding and patience attitude in the respect that it's out of my control. I'm just worried because I know your SO's mental health is impacted by your own and I cant bring myself to express the reality of how down it makes me feel because I'm never usually an unhappy person. 
I don't want him to feel as though I need constant support or for him to deal and provide a solution for me because it just doesn't work like that. But sometimes, you need someone there but I don't know how to relay that to him without giving off the wrong impression.
Another thing that bugs me is, he also spoke about his ex suffering from severe depression and although understanding and caring towards the situation always mentioned how exhausting and frustrating it can be to help someone with their mental health, which again I get because in no way shape or form is it a simple concept.

1884,dx5zpd,Request: I've been stuck in quasi-recovery for literally 2 years," 

\[TW - I'm not sure if it might be a trigger to some. I talk about my past, recovering but never fully recovering. Current habits. Do not read if you are on the road to recovery!\]

Long story short. I had A/N (B/P subtype) for many years. Too many years. You already know the whole story - getting down to a dangerous weight, dragged to inpatient, blablabla. That cycle repeated sooo many times... Until one day, two years ago, it eventually.. stopped. I was getting better.

Which brings me to today - I honestly don't identify with having an ED anymore. I do not count calories, weigh myself, nor am I even trying to lose weight. Nobody around me thinks I have any problems anymore. I can force myself to eat ""heavy"" meals on special occasions like holidays etc without too much guilt. I have very few ED habits left. Sounds fine, right?

But I am not really 100% ""there"" yet. I feel ok, but I don't feel this freedom around food that maybe normal people are supposed to feel? I feel I have a skewed sense of what normalcy in eating looks like, and I can't understand hunger cues very well. Sometimes I think I ignore hunger not for the sake of restricting, but more of because it is what feels normal to me. I mostly stick to foods I am comfortable with, not because I want to lose weight, but because (once again) it is just what feels normal to me and I don't want to freak myself out. I feel like I have developed some almost.. food anxiety that is not classified as ED anymore? Like I just want to eat the amount and type of foods I am comfortable with (not a restriction amount). This has nothing to do with losing/maintaining weight, but rather what just makes me feel comfortable and 'ok' (if that makes sense at all). I don't think about my body image at all when I do this.

Oh, I mentioned that I was A/N (b/p). Well, I still do b/p once every few months. I consider it to be ""recovered"" as I used to b/p every single day (sometimes twice), so I don't consider having a ""stress b/p"" once every 3-5 months or so to be particularly debilitating to my life. Yet I know this can't be what full recovery entails... unless it is?

This has been going on for.... 2 years. Honestly, I feel fine, so I'm not particularly motivated to change my behaviour (compared to when I was in the depths of ED and depressed &amp; miserable). Yet I know it is very weird to behave like this forever... It is almost like some weird in-between stage of A/N and normalcy. Maybe this is just how I'm meant to live? I'm not exactly unhappy but I don't feel fully free.

An additional note, I am weight restored but barely. I am still slim and my weight has not changed since I first ""recovered"". Doctor said I could stand to gain a little more weight but it's not medically necessary. Maintaining my weight is not my main motivation of my food behaviour at all.

Sorry for the long read - TL;DR: Many years of struggling w A/N (B/P subtype). Recovered two years ago but still not at 100%. Mostly stick to safe foods and comfortable amounts. I don't identify with ED anymore as am not trying to lose/maintain weight and don't care about body image - it's more of an anxiety thing. I don't feel unhappy.

1885,dx5ynl,Request: Seeking relationship advice," 

Hey!

I have recently had a relapse with restrictive eating which was triggered by IF ( I have had ED’s since 13)

I told my boyfriend and initially he was supportive but also didn’t understand and kept saying that I didn’t need to lose weight. It has affected us because I have become more aware and self conscious of my body and don’t like him touching my stomach or inner thighs (also made sex difficult sometimes)

He has made it known that it is an unattractive thing to be shy and self conscious and that when we first met I didn’t act like this. It is making me feel unattractive and like he would rather be with a sane confident person

I am getting easily triggered by him because he is exercising a fair bit and also IF , he has also made some triggering comments. My body and food are constantly on my mind which is making it tricky to think of anything else sometimes even when I want to.

The other day we had a small argument because he described me in a certain way, which I believed to be fat and he is frustrated because he feels like he has to watch his words and he doesn’t want to. He doesn’t get eating disorders and has quite a blunt unsympathetic approach to the whole thing.

1887,dx5pqd,Request: Not sure if I’m relapsing,"( f24) long story short I used to have an eating disorder I was diagnosed anorexic my junior year of college really bad I had to go to outpatient treatment my disorder consisted of OCD tendencies repeating what I ate in my head after I ate something , I was a club cross country runner at my college so I was also an athlete working out and running all the time and not eating enough. Not eating in front of people always looking at food pictures on my phone and becoming anti social. 

Fast forward to now it’s been since 2017 that I was forced to get help but this year I have been weighing my food and counting macros I really thought I had a handle on it until recently. I  am taking accutane and I started going into a depressive episode whether it was accutane induced that’s possible but it’s still happening to me. I am a marathon runner now but i feel way to huge for the times I want. 

They say every X pounds is Y seconds of your mile time and I really want a Boston qualifier time this next year. It started with eating cleaner but I wasn’t seeing results and my runs seemed slow for me still so I dropped my calories I’m maybe eating significantly less 1 or 2 meals a day if I can get them down. I genuinely don’t know if I should be worried I’m still eating I’ll always eat breakfast but I might have a smoothie for nutrients and run fuel then pick at my dinner which is usually chicken. I went to the doctor for my depression weighed me it wasn’t what I wanted. 

My appetite for food is less and less to the point where it makes me sick to eat and I just can’t even touch food only a little bit. I really need to drop weight for my speed at the same time I am not sure I can eat normally right now and it kind of just hit me recently being much worse than just counting macros. The weekend scares me and the holidays scare me I don’t want to lose progress. I also just got on an anti depressant but I also take adderal for add but before you say adderal makes me not eat that’s not the case I need it and it’s never been this bad in that sense.

1888,dx5ocy,"Request: Obsessed with gym, getting lean and muscular - but small","I’m not talking big muscular. I’m talking lean, shapely, with some visible, attractive muscle definition (and a higher TDEE). I used to be anorexic, now weight restored, I’m into fitness a big time but I’m continuously stuck in the binge/purge cycle. My diet is all over the place, which is why it’s almost impossible for me to actually make any progress and gain any muscle. I’m constantly trying to restrict AND at the same time get a lot of protein in, which is already hard enough. And because my workouts are intense and very exhausting (but completely reasonable for a well-fed person), my appetite is through the roof. I always end up binging and then purging (mostly overexercising) and restricting - and it’s a vicious cycle. I’m getting nowhere with my fitness goals because I’m too scared to maintain or purposefully bulk (to build muscle) but I also fail miserably at restricting.

Is anyone in a similar situation? How do you handle the conflict of trying to be fit and very lean and having an ED on to of it?",1573903072,11/16/2019 5:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dx5ocy/request_obsessed_with_gym_getting_lean_and/,11

1890,dx5o8p,Request: Personal: unable to feel full,"Hi everyone,

New here, but I’m currently 21 and I was previously suffering from eating disorder(s) (won’t dive into it extremely). From 14-16 was the worst of my issues, then I seemed to recover, and had a few slip ups in between. 

However, last year I got very heavily into exercising and dieting. I started to track my macros and that kinda sparked bad habits again. I got too obsessive and eventually broke down because it was wearing me thin. I was always hungry, tired, and drained, so I stopped counting and went back to eating intuitively. I also drastically increased my calories. 

Although I am eating more and I’m no longer counting what I eat, I am still literally so hungry that it is insatiable. I am 5’3, small frame, I should not require half as much food as I eat but I literally can eat PLATES upon PLATES of food in one sitting, and then 45 minutes later be hungry again. It is LITERALLY like my stomach has no end, like I don’t know what full is anymore. I tried to eat until I was full once recently, and it literally involved shoving my face with food.

I haven’t known what full feels like in so long it’s ridiculous. I didn’t have this problem previously, and it’s getting annoying, because I’ll go out to eat and then have to eat again 45 minutes later. And I’m not eating extremely small portions anymore - I’m eating normal sized portions. Any advice? How do I make this go away? I’m back at a weight my body sits comfortably at so I don’t know why my hunger hasn’t subsided.",1573903052,11/16/2019 5:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dx5o8p/request_personal_unable_to_feel_full/,13

Id love some advice. I started recovery from atypical bulimia + anorexia a few weeks ago and managed to take steps to a point where my physical wellbeing is not endangered. I eat enough, somewhat healthy and do not use extreme behaviours.
However, the thoughts havent gone away. I still feel horribly overweight (even though it is in normal range) and I can tell that I still have all sorts of wrong thoughts (for example being happy about being dizzy or cold).
So while I dont have a lot of problems eating normally, I am sure my ED is still lurking and I am afraid it might cause me to relapse.
I know that there is probably no definite answer and that I am just a stranger on the internet, but I would love advice on whether you think I should do an inpatient program or not. My therapist recommended it but I am not sure if I am 'sick enough' or if I actually need it.
If anyone has personal experience with something along these lines and would be willing to open up, I would be forever grateful.

(Because lets be honest, recovery is terrifying to me right now.)",1573902940,11/16/2019 5:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dx5nqt/request_inpatient_treatment/,2
1896,dx5ney,"Request: Looking for easy to swallow healthy foods, and maybe some further input..?","I read the post about the person questioning if they have anorexia or not. I relate heavily, as I also eat like a meal and a half a day plus healthy snacks, and have thought little of it til now. I don't think I'm underweight right now, but I have been before. Like, 2 yrs ago there was reason for concern, but I am currently a healthier weight. 

The problem is that when I was a kid, I was diagnosed as hypoglycemic. I was malnourished due to neglect and poverty. So even though I don't consider myself severely underweight, not eating properly is beginning to get very concerning. I will wake up disoriented, dizzy, sometimes nauseated and with a mild to severe headache. Sometimes this happens at other times as well, but mostly when I wake up. I get dizzy spells during the day, bad shakes, and heart palpitations, which only get significantly worse if I perform physical activities. I carried a large ladder from the front to back yard the other day, and my heart rate was over 120 bpm and I felt like I was about to pass out. This is only 2-3 hours after a meal. Also, fatigued virtually all the time, though sometimes I can feel more mentally awake if I'm focused on something, and tend to forget about my ailments til I'm done. 

I have a number of different mental disorders now due to trauma/abuse/etc, but all things considered, I think of myself as relatively strong willed, and when I encounter an issue in my mind or body, I make great efforts to overcome and grow from it, if at all possible. So yes, crippling anxiety is definitely a huge factor in this. But it isn't always pressing me when I can't eat.

And now, the fun part that is leading me to post on this sub. Sometimes I can eat well, sometimes I cannot. Sometimes good food will smell and/or taste completely bland, leaving only the aftertaste behind, or I'll get one final bite into my mouth, only to have to wretch it back up into the trash as if it were cough medicine or a nasty tasting shot of liquor. Even if I enjoy it. Sometimes anxiety and depression are factors that can prevent me from eating, but that is not always the case. I am also not worried about my weight, I am happy with my weight range. I don't feel like a model, but I don't feel particularly unattractive either. So it's difficult for me to track down the source to this issue. 

My main concern is that I am not getting the nutrients that I need, despite my efforts to buy more healthy and sustainable foods to try to make up for my inability to eat sometimes. Liquid meals help A LOT, and I've noticed that if it starts tasting nasty, I can choke down a few bites if I go ""MMMMM!"" while doing it, to confuse my brain signals and distract my throat with the vibrations. 

I wish I knew what to eat more of to make me feel less awful all the time. I heard hypoglycemia can turn into diabetes pretty quickly, and I can't tell sometimes if I'm having a small heart attack or my sugar is too low or if it's too high. 

Sometimes eating more carbs helps, sometimes it makes me feel worse. I tried this green smoothie powder today, and was able to ingest about half a serving of it. It wasn't bad, but tasted like ground children's vitamin chewables. I usually like to keep a bottle of Kefir around to aid in protein levels and act as a probiotic. It's the easiest thing for me to drink/eat cuz it tastes like buttermilk and for some reason that works for me. But lately, that's been making me feel very sick. Not the flavor or smell, but how I physically feel afterwards.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome and appreciated, though if you're going to be one of those guys to immediately tell me to seek therapy, I'll still stamp your ""supportive friend"" card for ya, but I ask that you please also add a little personalized something to your comment to make me feel like you at least put some thought into it of your own.

1897,e2eb9t,"Request: help: post-bulimia recovery, pcos-concerned orthorexia and binging","

I've had disordered eating since I was 17 and I am now 26. 

It's been two years since I've had intense purging associated w binges. 

For a year, I was so ashamed of my purging that I became extremely restrictive. This is when family noticed and pulled me out of school to get help. The depression and chaos brought me back to intense cycles of binging and purging, and brought on shame that I had avoided for about a year while restricting. 

I have since 'recovered' , thanks to a daily dose of 60mg of Prozac and some support I had at the time. 

Here I am in a new state with little support, a PCOs diagnosis, applying to medical school, feeling on the verge of breaking all of my progress.

My ""lean-pcos"" diagnosis, hirsutism, and acne introduced me to the world of Paleo, clean eating, studies of how grains, insulin, etc trigger hormonal responses that will cause inflammation and out of whack hormones. 

I am terrified about how food may affect me, my hormones, how I look, yet when I do eat I find myself having a hard time stopping. Nearing binging. Feeling bad afterwords and angry and gross. 

Although I have these orthorexic thoughts , I often find myself making excuses in the moment, or saying ""eff it"" and eating crap. 

I went off my Prozac bc my libido was so low and I haven't been feeling ""depressed"" lately, also it causes bad dry mouth. Maybe I need to go back on it.

Can anyone relate to lingering ED thoughts, behaviors, obsessions, or rationalizing? Obsession with food?

1908,e1w945,Request: I Think About Food Constantly,"Hi. So this is my (20F) first post to this thread so sorry if I’m doing any of this wrong. 

But I’ve had a really bad relationship with food for a long time, and I’ll try and keep this short- the thing is my dad used to really meanly comment on my eating habits my whole life. Always telling me I was eating too much (I was a chubby kid, but active) and I needed to diet or I was going to end up like my obese aunt. So by the time I’d gotten to high school I’d developed pretty severe depression (more to it than just this but that’s another story) and started restricting myself from eating, exercising on the treadmill instead of going to the cafeteria for lunch, skipping meals with friends, and constantly keeping my daily calorie count below a certain number. I’ve never seen a therapist or ever really talked to anyone about it, but after graduating I’d been eating more (no more calorie counting, but I’m still very aware of how much calories I’m consuming) and in the past two and a half years I’ve put on more weight and I’ve been obsessed with how I look. And the days when the depression is at its worst are the days I don’t eat, but all I do is think about food.

If I’m not eating, I’m thinking about eating or making food, all I want to do is eat. But I hate myself for eating, I feel guilty, like I’m betraying myself, like I’m doing something wrong.

1910,e1ejf8,Request: Bedroom Breakfast,"

Hi all! My first post here. I’ve been in recovery from ARFID/orthorexia for 3 years and feel super stable where I’m at now. I still see a dietician and a therapist biweekly but my relationship with food is fantastic. Still I remain constantly vigilant, I refuse to slip backwards. I’m trying right now to brainstorm ideas for breakfasts I can keep in my bedroom. This has always been a struggle for me but some mornings I just don’t want to walk down two flights of stairs to eat and I put it off until it’s too late. I have a mini fridge in my room but it’s broke and only freezes lol. I’ve though of getting a toaster and keeping some waffles or toaster strudel in there. Maybe some pop tarts? I didn’t want to add another appliance to my room but if I want a warm breakfast up here on rainy days it might be the way to go. Do any of you keep food in your room for times when you can’t face the outside world? If so what do you or would you recommend?

I'm underweight, but I would love to gain weight, I just can't because I have no appetite and mostly eat only once a day. This really messes with my head and it has made me depressed and suicidal time and time again during the past 3 years.

1916,e0xgip,Request: Not sure if this a weird pattern of eating,"I’ve always had a weird relationship with my self image. This summer I worked out everyday and by the end of it my family and friends were commenting on my ‘six pack’ and that I had lost a lot of weight and was I okay - I still think I looked really overweight. 

Now I’m at uni and I felt so bloated after my first exam - I didn’t eat so much, but I couldn’t really exercise besides walking to campus, and ate biscuits (which I didn’t do before). 

I started eating cleaner, they fixed our fridge in halls so I cooked lots of healthy meals and went to the gym for the first time in five or six weeks. I did half of my normal routine. I felt great at the gym but came home and had blurry vision, and then difficulty speaking. My parents looked after me and I was better towards the end of the night. My blood pressure was measured and it seemed normal. 

My parents had a friend over for a takeaway that same night, and I relented and took part in the curry meal (I was very hungry and hadn’t really eaten yet). This morning I got up to have the rest of the meal and found that the naan bread was gone - one of my parents had accidentally thrown it away while clearing up. I usually clear up but they told me to sit back down because of earlier that evening. 

I felt so upset over this naan bread, not because of my parent because it was an easy mistake to make, but because it feels like a sign that I shouldn’t have been eating it in the first place, that I also shouldn’t have been having any of the rice or veggies or chicken. I had a benecol instead.

I really just want to sit down and enjoy food but I’m always conscious of how much it ‘costs’. I’ll sometimes fantasise about how good a meal is going to taste and then be upset by how I managed to eat it all, or by how quickly I’ve eaten it (sometimes relatively slow to others) and that I should have been more responsible and spread it out so I could enjoy it more. 

Can anybody give me some insight into what’s going on? If it’s any help I tend to get these symptoms at this time of year, and they disappear when it gets hotter again. Some people in my personal life have commented it sounds wrong which I agree with, but I don’t think it’s an eating disorder.",1574595401,11/24/2019 5:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/e0xgip/request_not_sure_if_this_a_weird_pattern_of_eating/,2

Title: Does anyone else experience periods of addiction to certain foods? 

I’ve been treated for a EDNOS (Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) and have been in a 30 day program at an ED facility once before (7 years ago). I have gradually fallen off the promising recovery wagon since my stay seven years ago in a facility. I don’t know why I can’t commit anything, it’s always been an issue for me. Maybe part of not taking care of myself stems from self-esteem; I sometimes equate worthiness with eating healthy foods. I was diagnosed with EDNOS because I tend to binge and restrict (not nearly to the point of anorexia, it more has to do with being able to comfortably eat alone and control things), have weird eating patterns, and exhibit some ritualistic behavior with food, emotionally eat, and so forth. 

I’m thinking my phases of being addicted to certain food is part of my ED. Right now, I’m practically addicted to Panda Express (same order every time and sweet &amp; sour sauce is an essential staple of this meal for me); I fluctuate between that and a certain meal from McDonald’s. In the past it’s been a specific meal at KFC, McDonald’s, Arby’s, etc. I shouldn’t even be spending money on food, I’m honestly too poor. When this happens I have to rotate the restaurants I go to so that I don’t encounter the same employees almost every day. This costs time and gas. But. I. do. it. anyway. I get so angry at myself for wasting money and eating poorly. I’m basically obese and have been become increasingly angry towards myself about my body. 

Has this ever been a problem for people experiencing an ED?  What helped you manage it?",1574419560,11/22/2019 4:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dzzcrh/request_post_request_does_anyone_else_experience/,2

I grew up with severe depression most of my teen years (now 30). Hearing the struggles she went through, I found it both therapeutic for me, and a seemingly great way to connect. Sharing my experience, I think, helped her feel less alone, and ""normal"" in the sense that it's a medical condition to be treated, and not something wrong about *her*.

Where I struggled, was that she has a lot of pain and anxiety when it comes to confronting ""the wasted years"". I went through that myself, but I'm struggling to frame it in a healthy light.

Food was always problematic to me... Usually the way I am feeling reflects on what and how much I eat and it can go both ways (eating much or nothing at all). Last time I had problems with eating was a few years ago, I was emotionally and mentally unstable and went through a process of not eating at all (or eating very little per day) for a few months and it evolved to also sometimes puking whatever I ate. It was not the first time I had problems with but it was perhaps the most intense and the longest (it lasted for over 8 months I think)... I eventually managed to get out of this by myself and started eating normally again... But I basically never told anyone about it, and I never seeked help.
I have over the years never went back to this habits though it has been hard and I had my struggles with food.... Now I'm going through a bad moment in my life again and going through an emotional breakdown... Because of it I completely lost my appetite and don't feel like eating at all...

1924,dzzbis,Request: Do I have a problem . Why do I hate myself,"Hello everyone 

I was always a slim healthy child but when I was around 13/14 I put on weight . It didn’t bother me one bit I was happy . To sum it up I moved schools and country’s an I guess I just stopped sports  as much as I did before I moved so I gained some weight .

I got teased by kids at school and my close friends who at the time were smaller than me . It didn’t bother me I didn’t answer them back an I just moved on with my life . 

But when I was 14/15 I suddenly just felt big so I started running as a hobby . Tbh I enjoyed it , it wasn’t for losing weight at first . I used to run every day about 2/3 KM at night after diner. It was my mental therapy it made me feel good . 

I did this for a few months and I used to get angry when I missed a run . It became a addiction my escape . 

Following this  started getting compliments from girls at school “ you lost weight omg! “ you look great . My mom even noticed an said oh look your growing up and filling out! 

Tbh I didn’t think much of these things being said but it did make me feel good . 

By this time I was still running every night and eating pretty normal . 

I moved again the next school year ( dad’s job) to another country an I really really didn’t like it . I used to go to the gym every day to run for about a hour to let stress out . 

I eventually joined a running competition but I didn’t do very well . I had no energy in the race am I came pretty last my parents weren’t happy . I was very slim but no muscle 

So then I didn’t really eat much food didn’t speak to me I didn’t crave it when sad I just worked out more . 

So I moved again within three months ahahah summery of my youth . 

In this new school an country I was happy I stopped working out as much am just lived I was very slim but I got a lot of attention from guy so I was happy with how I looked . 

After these years I started modeling at 17 I got scouted and I loved it . I got told I had the body an the face an the height . I did it for fun never took it seriously .

I stayed about the same body wise until  I went to collage . 
I put on weight in collage I couldn’t keep up with how much I put on my breast are huge and I feel fat . Fat . 
I feel so shit about myself o compare myself to every girl . 
I don’t eat shit in the day but at night I can’t stop eating . I crave food it’s always on my mind . 

So I joined a gym a few days ago to feel better about myself but I have no motivation to run . I used to run for a hour now I can’t last two minutes . I’m really struggling . I feel huge and my boyfriend has made some comments lately about my eating habits which havnt helped “ Hanna you don’t have to stuff your face the food isn’t going anywhere” I just can’t stop myself .

It hurt he didn’t mean it in a bad way but it hit hard . 

But yeah I need advice I feel awful about my body an I’m not model body material right now even tho I wanted to start again. 

I’m losing my mind . 

Also idk if this is being dramatic but a lot of people have said these comments to me an it really stuck with me 

“You have the face but yeah not the body your curvy “ my mom 

“You have the face!!!!”

“Your so slim but such big boobs!”

It just hurts even my mom she said to me “ your face is plain without makeup “

Am I too sensitive for getting upset at these issues ?  Do I have a problem ?

1931,dzhgeo,Request: Am I doing the right thing? I don’t know if what’s happening is normal...,"I made a post last week, where I mentioned I was worried I was developing an ED. As I got a reply saying that I was most likely right, I started trying to stop it getting worse. I thought it’d go away if I just ignored the thoughts and forced myself to eat normally but it’s not going how I thought it would.

At first adjust to eating normally was really hard, I was able to convince myself to start eating breakfasts again quite easily, but it was lunch that was a real issue since I’d been denying myself them for nearly 3 weeks now. I remember on the first day that I made myself have 3 meals, I was in a constant state of anxiety throughout the whole day, I was only able to make myself eat half my breakfast, and then at lunch I couldn’t do it and had to make something much smaller than I originally intended. I even nearly had a panic attack about a pear drop a friend gave me.

After that though, things started getting a bit easier, and now I can eat much more normally without forcing myself so much, but I’m still getting huge amounts of guilt after eating even just a normal sized meal, and I often feel physically sick after some meals, even though they aren’t really bigger than anything I used to eat before this started. I’m always really anxious about making myself eat, and I can’t think about food outside of when I eat my meals or I start feeling sick with worry.

A 4 days ago though, this really weird thing happened. My appetite just completely disappeared. Totally. I don’t feel any desire to eat or anything anymore. I can still tell when I should be hungry as I can feel when my stomach is empty, but it’s not like normal; if I didn’t make myself eat, I wouldn’t want to. Now I have to make sure I eat 3 times a day deliberately since I just have no desire to eat.

I’m also finding that as I’ve been trying to make myself eat normally, the ED’s voice seems to be getting quieter, and I’m hearing it less. But as this is happening, my depression has been getting worse, and that’s making me feel worse than I ever did while I was letting myself develop the ED.

I spend so much time just lying in bed feeling... nothing. I don’t have any motivation, I don’t feel happy, I don’t feel sad... I just want to sleep. Whenever I’m like that, I keep feeling these new thoughts, telling me I should go back to the way I was acting before, and listen to the ED’s voice again. When I was doing that, I always felt so in control, it made me happy as I felt like I was doing the right thing, even know I know I wasn’t. So why do I keep wanting to go back to it!? I don’t know. It’s so strange...

Is this normal? Am I doing the right thing by forcing myself to eat normally? Why do I keep feeling like I’m doing everything wrong and I should just let myself listen the voice again?

Then on the other hand I feel fat, but I still want to eat when I’m not hungry. I don’t understand this. I used to eat normally, then I stopped eating and was anorexic for a bit. Then I got better and ate normally. Now I can’t stop eating. What is wrong with me.

1934,dzhfwf,Request: Doctors won’t give my bulimic little sister the help she needs because she is not ‘under weight’,"Hi all,

My little sister is 15 and she’s a healthy weight,
she isn’t big at all but she is just a normal weight in the eyes of professionals. She lost a massive amount of weight over the past 5 months, I’m not sure how much exactly but the doctors didn’t see that so they have decided to not take much notice in it.

She has admitted to me she is bulimic, after noticing little things like her sipping water constantly between meals, going to the bathroom after every meal, running taps whenever she went to the ‘toilet’. Eventually I went to speak to her and she broke down and had to open up to me.
After a while she finally agreed to get help, so we went to the gp who’s first comment was “well you’re obviously not underweight” ??? Who says that to a young girl who is there for that exact reason? Anyway, she just told us to watch her eating and told her to eat 3 meals a day and to return if we saw any drastic weight loss.

Obviously this only made things worse and she saw no point in getting help, she felt worse than before because even the doctor had pointed out her weight. 
After a few weeks of research we got a referral to speak to somebody at CAHMS (child and adolescent mental health services). The initial appointment went well and she scheduled her an appointment with an ED specialist to weigh her and talk through her eating habits etc... 
AND AGAIN, before he weighed her, before he even spoke to her his initial comment was “you’re noticeably not underweight”.

WHY? Is this a normal thing? I don’t understand how health professionals, even those who specialise in the illness can be so insensitive.

Does anybody have any suggestions on where we can actually get help and not accentuate the problem? Worried as although she is not yet an unhealthy weight, the affects bulimia has on your body aside from the weight loss are extremely serious. She has complained of cramps in her chest a few times over the past month and I’m worried it’s going to turn into something worse than it already is.

It’s not often somebody actually builds courage to ask for help and they just aren’t taking it seriously.

Thank you!!!!",1574332459,11/21/2019 4:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dzhfwf/request_doctors_wont_give_my_bulimic_little/,14
1935,e68gjs,Request: Eating anxiety ?,"Just wanted to see if anyone else experiences this. 
I(23F) struggled with cycles of restricting/exercising/bulimia in highschool and I more less now just struggle with an occasional relapse that I can pull myself out of. I have a lot of anxiety in general, again I struggle way less than I use to however my partner really analyzes the things I do. I’ve never had such an attentive partner and it makes me realize some irrational things that have been normal to me or I brush off. 

For instance, when questioned what I’ve eaten that day no matter what the context (wanted to see if I wanted to go out to eat, if we just wanted to snack ect) I get defensive and brush it off like don’t worry about what the hell ive eaten. Even when it was asked just to gauge our plans. Like I have shame associated with the fact that I’ve even eaten food. 

I didn’t think it effect me that much but we were at work and he asked me what I wanted to eat later when he came over, immediately I panicked. And tried brushing it off like “you’re stressing me out and I’m just having anxiety, so not really hungry, can’t really think of food, nothing sound good”. When in fact those are lies, I was totally going to eat dinner and I’ve had normal meals. I just panic at the thought of eating with someone ?

My last example of recent incidences is, my roommate and I made holiday type sugar cookies and fudge, so when I was fine I made a goodie bag for work since her and I couldn’t possibly eat it all. I brought it to work, put it in the fridge, but then couldn’t bring myself to tell my coworker, who is also the same guy (insert evil laugh of poor life choices) that I brought what I brought if he wanted it. I know he saw it in the fridge. But the words seemed impossible to say. I ended up not being able to tell him at all, then playing it off like I forgot all about it and texted him about it that night. 

I’ve tried researching disordered eating since I don’t fit any category for an ED anymore, do I just have anxiety about food and how people perceive me? Sometimes these things don’t matter and I can do all the above and go to restaurants, cook for friends, talk about what I’ve ate. Other times they are impossible obstacles. I’ve never been to counseling, and I’m currently in the military so it isn’t really an option.

I need some help. Its hard talking about it ao please be nice.

I am a little overweight. Between curvy and plain obese. So my mum decided i need to lose weight and is bribing me to lose weight.
I have been struggling to do it, her attitude towards my extra weight has made me extra insecure. I already had body isssues before based on an abusive relationship. This was just the last drop.

I started purging, restricting and working out. The purging is relatively controlled, only dinners and on days i dont work out. This is since i have a close friend group that helps me not spiral. 

Now for school i need to study abroad for a full semester. I am afraid if im away from my friends i will spiral and start purging after every actual meal i eat( one or two a day) and even on days i work out. To get rid of my fat quicker. 
I really want to stay here in my city. The school wants documentation from a therapist that i actually have an ED. My school doesnt offer therapists for issues this heavy. 

I can afford one therapist in my town and she said it was my choice to feel fat and schould just stop feeling fat. No tools on how or guidlines. The rest i cant afford and my mum doesnt want to help pay for it.

What can i do? I dont want to spiral, which will happen if im away from my current enviroment. But school needs this documentation.

I am starting an Intensive Outpatient Treatment program for a diagnosed eating disorder. The referral was at the request of my Primary doctor and clinical health psychologist. I’m fine with going and I look forward to it. My main issues come from a lack of interest in food and an intense fear of getting sick from eating. However, my psychologist thinks I punish myself from a history of childhood trauma, but I don’t agree. Has anyone else dealt with this? Do you ever feel like your psychologist tries to plant ideas in your brain on why you’ve developed the habits and fears that you have? I feel alone here. She diagnosed me with anorexia nervosia and somatoform disorder. I used to want to eat, just not really into it anymore and I am underweight and my labs are concerning. I know it’s something I need to address and will at the IOP, but I feel like she’s trying to plant fears in my brain so I can connect them with childhood traumas.

1940,e5fit8,Request: Coming to grips with my eating disorder,"

So I know I have an eating disorder, but it's so hard for me to accept and believe it (sorry if that's an oxymoron). 

I've been fat shamed all my life, particularly my mom. She often restricted what I could eat (like not eating pork because it would make me fat) and also glaring at me with disgust whenever I ate. Made it impossible for me to eat alone in public for a long time without fearing that people were thinking that I was fat. When I went to college, I obsessively began trying to lose weight so that I could avoid the 'Freshman 15' and preempt any comments regarding gaining weight. I started working out twice a day and restricting my calorie intake. Sophomore year, I started binging and then gaining weight, and then started purging whenever I felt ultra disgusted with what I ate. Also took laxatives as well. (Don't purge anymore though). At this point I was checked into an ED clinic at school, who I then ghosted because I felt like seeing them was counter productive to my goal of losing weight. Stopped purging the summer between Junior and Senior year. Senior year, I started going back to the methods I used Freshman year and ate only protein bars and shakes everyday while working out all the time. Lost a lot of weight doing this. Now I'm in my 5th year (graduated, then realized I was still lost so I extended to another year), deeply depressed and not eating, in part due to medication and also from a fear of gaining weight. 

Sorry if this is rambling, but even given all of this a lot of times I feel like I don't have a problem. To me I never starved myself completely and was no bone skinny, so I don't actually have a ""real"" eating disorder. I purged maybe once or twice a month, so since I wasn't doing it every day it wasn't a real problem. Even now when I know I only eat one meal a day and that my Psychiatrist thinks it's a problem, I still don't believe it. It then becomes hard to really make an effort to heal, since I don't fully believe I have a problem. 

Any help with acceptance and healing? Sorry if this doesn't make sense. It's very hard for me to believe anything about myself if it isn't heavily reaffirmed (i.e. hard to not believe I'm fat since it was constantly told to me growing up)

1943,e58auh,Request: Family and eating disorders,"

This is kinda hard for me to talk about. Let’s just say that lately I’ve realised that eating disorders definitely run in the family, even if I don’t understand the cause. My aunt and cousin suffer from orthorexia, they’re literally obsessed, but of course they don’t recognize it as an ED. I do, they really have a problem. My parents and other relatives have always been obsessed with weight and diets and, last but not least, my cousin (18F) suffered from severe anorexia, she’s now recovered, and then there’s me. This leads to a major issue that actually makes me suffer. I’m now 20 years old but I’ve been struggling with eating since I was 13; I think I’ve never developed a real eating disorder since the beginning of 2019: I haven’t eaten properly for months,  I often fast, and lately I’m either restricting or bingeing and purging. But what makes me suffer is that nobody in my family knows what’s going on with me, and I’m not willing to tell them since I don’t want to make my cousin suffer or make her think it’s linked to her somehow, or worse, I don’t want her to relapse... I always act like I’m totally fine and I eat normally in front of them but I actually have an eating disorder and having to hide it somehow, knowing that it’s an issue of the family, I don’t know... just makes me suffer... how do you think I should act?",1575332210,12/2/2019 18:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/e58auh/request_family_and_eating_disorders/,1

I’ve tried making meal plans for myself, and I’m about 1 1/2 years into recovery, and I’m genuinely surprised how far I’ve come 😂😂 

In general, I’m getting enough food- I guess that’s not really the issue. I’ve been challenging tons of fear foods and food rules, but I’ve been becoming more lenient? For example, one of the weird food rules I’m yet to give up is “if I eat breakfast, I can’t eat lunch, vice versa”. Whenever triggering situations happen, I fall into the cycle of “Oh I can make an exception this one time, and I’ll get back on track tomorrow”. 

Another thing I struggle with is worrying a lot about meals being “balanced”. It’s not enough to stop me from eating, per se, but it’s enough to keep me up at night. Even though I have no reason to be, I’m always worried that I’m “switching sides” from my ED, whatever the hell that means. I don’t know if that makes sense. It doesn’t help that my parents constantly comment on how many fats/carbs/artificial sugars/honestly-anything-at-this-point there are in my food.

I’m not sure if it’s relevant, but my current therapist doesn’t specialize in EDs, but in general she’s amazing with tackling all of the factors/triggers leading to it. But that means the food part is on me, which kinda sucks. In general I’d say i’m at a stable place in recovery, and I’m pretty committed to getting better.

Some context! I am not diagnosed with an ED, but for the past ~2 years I've been told by the therapist I used to see that I exhibit disordered eating patterns. I am still stuck in the cycle of restriction, bingeing (either actually or chew/spit), then compensating by overexercising, or just feeling guilty and depressed. I look healthy on the outside, but I'm now seeing symptoms that tell me I'm not healthy internally. So, I want to do something about this and stop obsessing over food 24/7 (which is freaking annoying)!!

I found a bunch of IG accounts advertising for ""intuitive eating"" so I've been trying to follow their tips, first by stopping restriction. I think this was a mistake: e.g. I told myself I would ""eat intuitively"" this morning, then proceeded to put down a whole cake. I feel like crap. And I know I'm going to overeat later today too. So I plan on strictly dieting for the rest of the week. This doesn't sound very intuitive, does it? But I can't make myself think any other way. 

In summary, I don't think I'm taking the right approach, but the mindset of an intuitive eater is my goal.

He wasn't hugely overweight to start with, probably only 30 pounds or so, but he has been losing weight very quickly. I always knew he hated his body but I didn't expect him to get so wrapped up in weight loss. 

When i was a teen (I'm 22 now) I had anorexia which turned into bulimia. I never got very skinny so it wasn't too noticeable to people around me, but it has messed me up mentally for a long time. I am uncomfortable with my body, I have a healthy bmi but I weigh more than i would like. He knows I used to have an eating disorder, but he doesn't know i still struggle with the thoughts. 

My boyfriend's diet has him restricting to very few calories daily just like I used to do, and he plans out his tiny meals and cuts food into little pieces. He says that he actually ""doesn't need to eat"" because he is fat so his body lives off that. He started a new thing where he doesn't eat at all on weekends because he isn't doing work so doesn't need to eat apparently. He cut out so much food and now basically just eats chicken and broccoli. He weighs himself like 3 times a day and he is doing really well. I'm happy for him but jealous too, if I'm honest with myself. 

There is so much more but basically, he just talks about calories and diets and body fat percentage all the time and it's making me feel extreme anxiety. 

Does he think I'm fat and gross if I eat when he doesn't? Does he hate the fact that I'm not super skinny? Is he secretly disgusted by my high body fat? I have asked him all these things and he says of course not, but it's hard to believe. 

I don't think he has an eating disorder himself, I'm probably just reading too much into his behaviour and relating to it, but I am constantly triggered.  I imagine it will be worse when he gets skinnier than me which seems like it will happen. 

I don't want him to stop his diet if it's making him happy and I know my feelings are unfair on him, but I just get this sick feeling in my stomach when he talks about how few calories he ate that day or how much weight he lost that week.

i’m 19 years old and a petite female. i’ve always been pretty small and skinny other than the muscle i had from high school sports which i have now lost.

recently, like the past maybe month and a half, i have just been so not hungry and very uninterested in eating. the thought of food or the smell of it usually makes me nauseous, and watching people eat makes me feel sick.

i do struggle with some low self-esteem and have always wanted my body to look different, slimmer longer and more toned in the right places, but i don’t know what’s going on.

i wouldn’t say that i am ALWAYS avoiding eating, but sometimes i do and sometimes i just am not hungry. i’ve been eating either a small snack a day (usually at night) or half a meal, or nothing. this has in turn made me lose some weight, i’ve been very weak, having dizzy spells, i’m usually shaky and clammy, and my sex drive is pretty abnormally low.

i’m nervous that this is the start of an eating disorder because i feel so out of control. but everything i’m reading online is making me question if i’m just making this up.

any advice or input would be extremely helpful. :) thanks",1575253173,12/1/2019 20:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/e4s1xw/request_nervous_that_this_is_the_start_of_an/,5

We don't weigh myself (I'm actually ashamed of my low-weight)

We don't purge

We don't over-exercise

We don't have body-image issues

We love food and eating, just fear the sensations of fullness after if we eat ""too much.""

1955,e3layx,Request: Tinder date revealed she starts treatment for an ED. I want to see her again.. should I?,"I had a first date a couple of days ago, with someone who told me she's about to be moving to my neighbourhood *for the winter* (she currently lives in a suburb of the large-ish city I live in). I asked her what was bringing her temporarily and she disclosed that she's starting treatment for an eating disorder. The date otherwise went (I felt) extremely well, and it sounds like we are both interested in meeting up again soon, but I'm wondering if it's healthy for her to pursue anything right now? Currently I'm planning to ask her the following questions:

- Do the facilitators of her treatment program recommend dating while she's going through the program?
- How can I (otherwise) support her while she's going through the program?

But also, I'm concerned about how her relationship with me could affect her recovery. Like, if we date for 8 weeks and it doesn't work out, could it exacerbate potential body dysmorphia issues (if her disorder is one which stems from those)?

I'm nervous, because I otherwise felt like a hit me over the head, butterflies in my stomach type of connection, based on other things we have in common, but I don't want to pursue something with her right now if it could impede her recovery.",1575063178,11/29/2019 15:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/e3layx/request_tinder_date_revealed_she_starts_treatment/,14

What were your experiences in there? How long were you in there for? What costs were there for you? Do they accept insurance? What about low income (ACA) insurance? Did they allow you access to internet?

Did you have an overall good experience there? Did you have your own room, or was it shared roommates? Was it a place solely for eating disorders, or were people with other psychiatric problems there as well (depression, bipolar, etc)?

If you have been in a mental institution as well, how similar to that was it? How far away did you have to travel for the inpatient care? How did you get home if you don't have a car? Where you able to use your phone/tablet?

What happened when/if you needed to pay rent, but were unable to drop the money off at the office or give your roommate's the money? Did they allow you to leave to go withdraw that money from the bank?

What if you have no interest in going to a group talking session? What sort of things do they look for to be released from inpatient therapy?

1958,e3dgxw,Request: Post Request: Holiday baking for a friend with an ED,"

My (20F) friend (20F) told me that recently her ED has gone into a bit of a relapse and she's having a tough go of it. She is planning on going to some specialist appointments in December, it's hard waiting for it especially with our school exams and projects that are already making this time of year difficult. I want to support her as much as I can and I plan on trying me best to help her with anything she needs, but I'm not really sure what to do.

Here is my main question: every year I do holiday baking for the important people in my life as a sort of Christmas gift. I was planning on sending a large box of desserts to her and her roommates (who I am also good friends with), but now I am worried that it will make her feel awkward or worsen the effects of her ED as this time of year is already bad enough. Is there a way where I could still give my friends this gift but not make her feel worse? Or would it just be better to scrap the whole idea and get the house something else instead?

1961,e91wik,Request: Seeking advice on helping my younger sister with her practical exam in becoming a CNA,"Hi, all.

I am helping my younger sister with her practical exam in becoming a CNA. This requires her to perform some tests on me as a nurse would in a doctor's office. However, she asked me how much I weighed so that she can get a good idea for when she weighs me (just in case that is one of the tasks she has to perform, the tasks are given at random). My family doesn't know this, but I had an eating disorder (untreated) and the topic of weight really triggers me. I don't want my sister to know how much I weigh, nor do I want her teacher to know either. (I once went to the doctor and the nurse announced my weight out loud to the entire office). I know that a patient can refuse to have the weight taken by the nurse, but this is a different case as this is her test to become a certified nurse assistant, and I don't want to decline and then have her fail her test, however, I am uncomfortable with this. I don't want my sister to know about my previous disorder, it's very triggering.

Tomorrow, I have to go with her to her school for a ""practice"" exam, I am deathly afraid of being asked my weight. Should I quietly go up to her teacher and explain the situation or decline to that test if she is given that test when the actual test day comes?

I also should add, I am the only person in my family who can go for her, otherwise she would fail.",1576036782,12/10/2019 21:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/e91wik/request_seeking_advice_on_helping_my_younger/,1

A different but slightly related thing is that I have sensory issues with most foods so the only foods I typically eat are things I shouldn’t eat tons of on a regular basis. I’m also usually very broke. All these things combined just make me end up not eating to save food, simply because I don’t feel like it, I’m busy, it wouldn’t be healthy for me to eat such a thing twice/three times a day, or a variety of other things. I don’t see myself as fat, I don’t have the typical body issues that they say people with EDs have. I looked at the FAQ and one of the threads I looked at mostly had comments saying if you don’t have that kind of thinking it’s not an ED.

  
Is my disordered eating just that or an ED? Does it actually matter? I can’t see any therapists so anything i would do to improve wouldn’t come from one.

1965,e8p2k6,Request: No eating disorder truly fit my description when I researched but idk what to do," 

I’ve always been a pretty picky eater, but I’ve always eaten when I’m hungry and I’ve never purposefully restricted my eating or tried to diet or anything. I used to have a negative body image when I was 14-16 but looking back I know I wasn’t “fat” and now I definitely don’t think that. Growing up I ate a lot of the same foods due to financial circumstances (ate a lot of chicken rice beans bread pasta etc) and I find myself now (20) only liking similar foods. 

When I came to college 2 1/2 years ago I lost weight, not a lot in terms of hard numbers, but a lot for me since I’ve always been on the low side of a healthy BMI. I became underweight and I noticed a difference in my body. It started I think because I absolutely couldn’t eat in the dining hall around other people. I thought it was first week anxiety (I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life) and I could only choke down vegetables and fruit for the beginning few weeks without becoming nauseous. I didn’t have any conscious anxiety about eating in front of people but I figured that was the only thing that made sense since I didn’t want to be thinner. 

Over the two years of being on campus I struggled to eat enough. I never ate breakfast, I’d pick at lunch and dinner usually becoming “full” after a few bites and nauseous after attempting to eat anything except my safe foods like vegetables fruit steak chicken breast. I was repulsed when I entered the dining hall and lost all appetite. When I left I’d get hungry again but it came to a point where I’d get too hungry to eat since I’d become nauseous. Sometimes I would “binge” (idek if that’s the right word I was kinda just eating a moderate amount but it was more than I ate all day) at night on the stuff I could have in my dorm like ramen and chips and refried beans but even in my own dorm I would get nauseous and stomach issues after a few bites. The only time I was relieved was when I was high, I started in college and used it more and more literally just to gain the ability to eat. Friends were concerned I had an ED and my family noticed my weight loss. But I’ve never had the negative body image associated with anorexia nervosa I don’t like being this skinny, I look like a child and my curves are nonexistent. 

I moved into my own apartment in August and I was super excited since I’ve always wanted to be able to control what I ate since I’ve always been picky. I started to like cooking and I make meals for me and my boyfriend every day but I’m not gaining any weight. I still get full super quickly and almost never finish a plate. I don’t have the nausea problem now unless I’m at a meeting or event where I’m anxious for other reasons, especially since I stick to cooking foods I know I’ll want. But if my boyfriend doesn’t ask me to make him food I won’t really make myself food. I’ve gotten used to the stomach growling of being hungry and I just kind of sit with it for a while and don’t have the motivation to eat anything. I’ve never in my whole life could eat In the first few hours of being awake and so if I wake up late (usually do) I won’t feel that I “can” eat until the afternoon and I’ll often realize I haven’t eaten all day at like 6, 7 pm. I work at a fast casual restaurant and will sneak little bites of food cause I’m hungry like a little cube of steak and some bacon and some wonton strips. But when I come home I will do everything I need to do like clean the apartment do the dishes put a load of laundry in, take a shower, etc before I start making anything because it’s past a point where I’m just used to the hunger. 

I think I’m doing better and so does my boyfriend since I eat lunch and dinner most days and I snack a lot in the middle of the night but I can’t help but wonder since I’m not gaining the weight back and I still don’t have the appetite I used to have if something is wrong. I know this was long, but I’ve never found a good answer and it’s been affecting me for far too long. I saw the school nurse once and she referred me to a nutritionist and it was literally the least helpful thing ever. I know how to eat healthy and I like eating healthy, I get more repulsed by super cheesy, greasy, creamy dishes and prefer simple things. I worked with a lady who does food therapy for children with ASD mostly and she said I might have sensory issues since a lot of my pickiness is based on texture as well. Which makes a lot of sense cause I can see a lot of overlap with my brand of anxiety and having sensory issues. 

Anyway, all this to say what do you think? No eating disorder truly fit my description when I researched but idk what to do. Thank you",1575974557,12/10/2019 4:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/e8p2k6/request_no_eating_disorder_truly_fit_my/,11

1967,e89y0k,Request: B12 deficiency + nausea + unable to eat,"Hi,
I have had disordered eating patterns due to depression, anxiety, and losing my spouse to colon cancer. I’m not “blaming” my spouse at all, but he was a big meat eater and I ate meat at the time. 

Since he passed, the depression hit hard first, and due to laziness, and the fact that he did most of the cooking (being far better at it than me and enjoying doing it), I stopped eating meat at home. I would still eat it if I ate out. 

A year later, I stopped working (burnout) and stopped eating out so wasn’t eating meat and not missing it. I gradually subconsciously stopped eating all animal products. I lost over 20% of my originally healthy weight. 

My B12 plummetted to half the minimum required for a deficiency diagnosis. In the last 3 months I have had chronic nausea (no, not pregnant) and haven’t been able to eat much. My B12 dropped again and I lost another 10% of weight to put me now underweight with low body fat. 

I otherwise eat a vegan diet with mostly fruits ans vegetables and will make muffins in a mug in a microwave (ya you can do that!) occasionally when I’m not lazy. I haven’t been taking the B12 supplements regularly because they increase my nausea, anxiety and insomnia. My ferritin level is now below normal too. 

I told my psych it was probably part stomach ulcer and partly psychosomatic but he disagreed and said I needed to see a specialist. I have not, because the nausea is not as bad now but I still have less appetite and to be honest, it doesn’t bother me. 

Those who restrict heavily, do you have a major b12 deficiency, and do you take supplements for it and do you have any effects from it? (ie nausea, anxiety, insomnia?)

It feels like every time a meal comes around, I go through the same thought pattern. I want to get something healthy, but my brain just keeps insisting that's a bad idea. I start thinking that I will regret getting the healthy thing because I'm going to crave the unhealthy thing later. And if I crave the unhealthy thing later, I won't be able to concentrate on anything because I'll just spend the rest of the day thinking about the unhealthy thing.

Most times I cave in and get the unhealthy thing. Sometimes I push through it and get the healthy thing, but then I'm obsessing over it for the rest of the day and sometimes even leave work early to get whatever unhealthy thing I've been thinking about.

1971,e7cnlr,Request: I need some advice on bulimia recovery; I'm currently unable to receive professional help.,"hey there. I'm pretty new to this community and need some advice.

I'm trying to lose weight for the sake of my health. I'm at a high risk for heart disease due to my weight, so naturally I'm concerned about it. I'm getting close to an obese bmi. i've been trying so hard to get to a healthier weight, but my eating disorder has been making it so hard.

basically, I keep getting sucked into a cycle of binging, purging, and then binging again. sometimes I'll fast in between. i usually go through the whole cycle within the course of a week, but i typically go from binging to purging to binging in a matter of hours and when i don't eat at all, it's for a few days. Regardless, i'd say i binge every day for every meal and purge at least once a day. and like I said, I'll sometimes go a few days and just not eat. it's been going on like this since middle school, sixth grade, probably. maybe even earlier than that. this whole thing makes it so difficult to lose weight and i really don't know what to do. 

I know it'd be best to get in contact with a therapist or a diet expert or something, but I don't think that's an option at the moment. I'm still in high school and I have no car and very little money. My parents would have to get involved if i saw a professional, but my dad never takes this stuff seriously and my mom looks down on it; she thinks people with disorders like this are beneath her, or at least that's how she makes it out to be. On top of that, I'm too embarassed of the disorder to talk to my parents OR a specialist about it. I know it's nothing to be ashamed of, but I'm really self conscious about my eating habits. I can't even eat around others (including my family) without feeling completely disgusting.

and besides, even if my family understood and were willing to get me help, we have no money for that and we don't have the insurance to cover it.

so basically, all of that exposition aside, i really think I need some help. i'm really worried about my health and i know it'll be hard to get healthier unless I can start to recover from this disorder. does anyone have some advice? have you been in a similar situation? is there any method you found really helped you combat it? I just want to know that I'm not alone and that I can fix this. 

also, since I forgot to clarify, my binging habits are the worst. I only fast and purge after I binge (which is regularly). I feel like I'd purge and fast way less if I cut down on/stopped the binging, but I seriously don't know how to do that. if you have some tips, they would be hugely appreciated!

I’ve always been kind of depressed but never gone to a doctor kinda just put that and the ED together. 

Anyway, Not exactly happy where I am wish I was lighter but this is besides the point. Last night my father found out exactly what I have been doing. It was humiliating, i felt ashamed, Hell im in the bathroom at work crying over it right now. 

I’ve never felt so weak and so humiliated in my life now that someone in my family knows. He said that he’s going to get a psychologist/ psychiatrist that I can see. But I don’t want one. 

I don’t want anyone to know, and I think that’s the issue. So for recovering people I guess how did you get better? I’ve tried not to do it today but I purged the cereal I ate this am and then sobbed my eyes out. 

If anyone has any tips please. Please.",1575713079,12/7/2019 4:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/e7cn9b/request_id_like_to_post_so_i_can_maybe_get_some/,3

1974,e7cmki,Request: Could you please make a post for me? Thanks,"Title: I’m afraid I’ve developed a form of BED in recovery for EDNOS/atypical anorexia 

Post:


I’m gonna try and not make this post super long, but if it ends up being long I apologize. I just need support/advice.

Backstory: I developed an eating disorder in 2018, EDNOS/atypical anorexia. I continued to use my disordered behaviors until around June of this year, and started recovery. I had a couple small relapses at the start, but I have been pretty steady with recovering since about August. I gave up weighing myself as often as I was (which was a lot, as I’m sure many of you may relate to). I started eating “normally”, or like I was eating before the eating disorder. But now, I am so hungry all the time and I’m eating more than I was before I even developed my eating disorder. I weighed myself for the first time in a pretty long time today, and I have gained weight and am now back to the weight I was pre-ED. Which isn’t over or underweight, it’s normal but a bit on the higher end of normal. My family (who aren’t aware I had/have an eating disorder in the first place due to problems that are too long to get into) has pointed out that I’ve gained a little bit of weight. When I was in the thick of my eating disorder, I wasn’t underweight, I was at the “perfect” weight for my height. But now I’m worried. I’m afraid I’ve developed or starting to develop a form of BED. Maybe it’s just a recovery thing, but I still am so scared. I have a medical condition that I take medication for, and for the medicine to be at the right dose I have to be at a certain weight and I’m worried about gaining any more weight than I already have because of that. But I don’t know how to lose weight without falling back into my old habits, and having to start all over again. I have not been able to see a professional about this all yet, I recovered initially all on my own. 

I apologize for the ramble, but if anyone has some insight or is able to offer some support I will very much appreciate it. Thank you.",1575712932,12/7/2019 4:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/e7cmki/request_could_you_please_make_a_post_for_me_thanks/,4

1976,e6x5y2,Request: Recovering but still struggling,"I’ve never posted something on Reddit but I guess there’s a first for everything. 

Since around last year? I started purging and showing bulimic behaviour. Thankfully it was not often, but it was still a regular routine after having too many snacks or binging on high calorie foods.  

Recently I just learned that even if you purge, the calories get absorbed into your body right from the moment it goes in your mouth. It’s definitely motivated me to not purge. Prior to learning this I also witnessed my dad have a stroke, and it was another reason why I really wanted to fight bulimia (it increases your chance of heart diseases). 

So good new is that I haven’t purged in more than two weeks. However, I have been losing my motivation to lose weight and have been gaining weight ever since. I apologize if dieting is a sensitive topic here... I’m just struggling with body image like we all are. It’s kinda ironic that I am healing from bulimia yet I’m still concerned about my weight and wanting to lose weight. 

But I’m definitely taking a healthier and sustainable approach this time. 

I myself am not really sure what this post is asking for. Advice for healthy dieting? Or some sort of connection with someone going through the same situation as me would be great haha

On the other hand, to everyone else going through bulimia, I understand you and yes it is possible to fight it. I wish you the very best.

1980,ecayxy,Request: recognizing I have a problem ... when it doesn’t feel like one?," 

I’m a 25 year old male, and I’ve never had any issues surrounding eating... until earlier this year. It started off around April, when I drastically changed my diet in anticipation of the summer. I started eating at a caloric deficit (avoiding all processed foods and depriving myself of all the junk food I used to eat) and started doing “intermittent fasting” (skipping breakfast and making sure to eat in like an 8 hour window). I also started exercising more regularly. I found it super easy to continue eating healthy for the next three months, and by July my body honestly looked amazing.

However, I started to get cravings for snacks (carbs/sweets) around that time. It started off that I would eat a very small amount of junk, and then have one small purging episode. I continued having one binging episode every two weeks or so until late August, when I left my old job and started a new one. I was super stressed/anxious around that time and that’s when I first had a huge binging episode (eating so much that I was painfully full). I purged... and felt horrible afterwards. I recognized that I was putting unnecessary stress on my body... but for whatever reason my brain doesn’t care. I have continued to have “spells” of 4-7 days of purging followed by 4-7 days of eating super healthy again.

My skin doesn’t look it’s best, my cheeks look fat, and my hair is kinda falling out.... but I think my brain is addicted to the pleasure of binging/purging. I feel like eating is now a drug...that I recognize I am using to manage anxiety (?). It’s weird because what started as something to help maintain a body image has morphed into something completely unrelated to body image. I currently don’t care what my body looks like... but continue to feel the need to purge? I’ll frequently tell myself “this is my last day”... but that’s probably happened 30+ times. I like it....

It’s weird because this doesn’t feel like something I need to get help for. I still make sure to eat healthy meals... just have huge binging/purging episodes (1-3 times for 3-7 days a week or so). Idk if anyone will read this but I needed to vent. I guess I have bulimia (?)

I've started fasting all day until 3-4 pm, then only eating a couple of small meals and not eating after 9 pm. I told my bf that I am trying out intermittent fasting to maximize the weight loss from the surgery, but I'm afraid that it is the disordered eating coming back. I've had so many people tell me that they know someone who had wls and gained all the weight back, and I am terrified that will happen to me. I'd rather die than regain the weight, but I don't want to develop an ED again.

Just for information's sake, I will say that none of my eating disorders were ever treated. My mother told an ER doctor that I could not be anorexic because I was fat.

I was eating one meal of cottage cheese every three days and exercising constantly. ) I have an appointment with a bariatric therapist next month, but I'm worried now.",1576665545,12/18/2019 4:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ecaypv/request_is_this_a_relapse/,4
1982,ecayo8,"Request: end of the line, don’t know where to go","
I’ve been struggling with an EDNOS for what looks like the better part of 6 years.  Modeling for the past 3, though I think that might be over for me.  This past week I’ve gained ** pounds from binging holiday cookies and Costco boxes of crackers in tandem with not moving.  I’m in my suburban home right now with nothing to do.  I’ve suffered from depression since my early adolescence and now feel like a totally “salt”less, interest-less, worthless &amp; primarily lazy 20 yo (female).  I used to love cooking before my fear of animal derived, and eventually virtually all, foods developed.  Though the phobia is only selectively effective.  

For the past 3 years, ever since my agent pulled me aside after my first fashion week season (of booking nothing) told me I was too big and specific metrics of my body I needed to work on.  I was in New York to escape my depression back home, to carve a new life, support myself and my mom as we needed.  I had to succeed, I ended up crumbling.  Now that I look back, I see my binges began when I went vegan in high school and would be so hungry after my mammoth portions of kale &amp; fruit.  I shovel down lays potato chips, Swedish fish, French fries and Oreos bc hey! They were vegan. 
 However, it was never an overriding issue in my life as it’s been since myself moving to New York 3 years ago.  I remember thriving off of a few hours of sleep 7am workouts a kombucha and handful of raspberries a day for the first 2 weeks.  

Two hyperdrive weeks then I crashed and started a binge that seemingly hasn’t stopped.   AT LEAST 2-4 times a week I binge until it physically hurts.  I’ve seen the tolls in my fluctuating weights, chronic headaches, fevers, infections, acne, TERRIBLE digestion, bloating, joint pain and lymph swelling.  I’ve socially isolated myself from my gaggles of model friends bc I’m so ashamed of my eating habits and letting my body balloon so rapidly.  My work has obviously suffered, my agency actually just released me. My weight gain now has me teetering on the overweight line and has greatly contributed to my depression.  Avoiding people is nothing new to me but I can’t stand to even see my best friends and have anxieties being around my family too.

 I’ve recently reverted from my plant based diet to eating everything (save beef &amp; pork) in efforts to recover and remediate myself.  Years ago I reached out to a doctor who said I was fine, months ago I consulted another who noted my healthy bmi and referred me to an out-of-network, and thus out-of-my-budget, nutritionist and therapists to ease my anxiety.   I want to be healthy physically and mentally but I don’t know what to do.  My family doesn’t believe in eating disorders and are wholly unsympathetic to my lack of self control.  I feel so ashamed and a burden to them and my friends.  I’m so overwhelmed, I don’t know what to do and where to turn.",1576665535,12/18/2019 4:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ecayo8/request_end_of_the_line_dont_know_where_to_go/,4

I currently see someone where this is one of the issues I talk about and make sure I stick with recovery (been officially in recovery for almost 3 years). I’m at a stable weight, I work out regularly, and I focus on strengthening my body. 

However, I feel like the past 4-5 months have been a bigger struggle for me than even in the beginning of my journey. I immediately started seeing my current therapist once I felt this shift in myself. Even though I still eat enough most days, there have been more days where I find myself restricting. It started off at once every other week, now I’m at multiple times in one week (usually no more than 3 days in a week). I’ve been eating less, but I still force myself to eat, especially when I’m not stressed out. 

I feel shaken some days about this, and that I’ve been just faking my recovery. I want to get better, but some days it just seems so easy to not eat or have a liquid diet because of stress. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone at all about this, except my therapist. My SO is aware of all of this struggle, but I haven’t had the heart to tell him how badly I’m struggling because I try my hardest to eat enough around him.

My anorexia consisted of me restricting carbs and fats, and I have introduced these back into my diet just recently. But my weight fluctuated significantly throughout the summer and still does today.  I even went through the horrid constipation and extreme bloating. However, I realized in order to stop this cycle I needed to quit viewing the exercise as a way to rid calories.

1992,ebw21t,Request: How to face Christmas holidays and eat what I truly want,"A little bit of background.

Last year in December I was deep into my ED, and I decided to embark in a one-month event restriction to ""be able"" to eat what I wanted over the Christmas holidays. In my country, Christmas holidays involve A LOT OF FOOD - it's not just Christmas, it's basically food food food food food from Christmas Eve to early January.

And so I did. I lost so much weight before Christmas, then regained it back over the holidays and somehow managed to come to terms with it.

This year I tried to do the same trick...only that it was so much harder because a) there are various stressors in my life that just make me more anxious and unstable in general and b) my ""starting weight"" was already lower than last year.

These past two weeks I have restricted SO MUCH. I overexercise. I keep myself obsessively busy to avoid eating. I wake up in the middle of the night dreaming of sandwiches. I feel cold all the time. I can't focus on anything. I am increasingly withdrawn and isolated. I abuse diet sodas and teas. Etc.etc.etc.

This morning I hit a new low weight and, as always, I kept telling myself ""yassss! Keep going! Christmas is coming! You will be able to eat all the food then! It's just ten days! Keep going! Keep going!!"".

But today something snapped, and I binged. I had such a wild binge. I crammed thousands of calories in my mouth in less than an hour. Then I went on to purge some of them, breaking my 50-days purge-free streak.

So now I am sitting here, feeling desperate because I have ""ruined"" all my ""progress"" and I won't lose weight and I will ""have"" to restrict during the holidays as well, instead of being able to eat whatever I want.

See, my problem is that my idea of eating whatever I want during the Christmas holidays is not just the usual stereotypical picture of this recovering anorexic ""finally enjoying a meal with her family"". No. I don't want to enjoy ""a meal"". I want to eat infinite meals. ENDLESS quantities of EVERYTHING. I know I do, because that's basically what I did last year.

I can't imagine having to succumb to my stupid shitty ED restrictive thoughts during the Christmas holidays too. I want to feel free at least for those days. I want to eat all the food, joining in with my family, feeling warm (by all meanings) and just stop caring about my little anorexic bubble for a while. But now that I binged I feel I have ""ruined everything"" and I do not deserve it anymore and everything will be as horrible and restrictive as usual.

I want to cry and feel hopeless. And yes, I do realize all of this is crazy - but I can't help it. I do have a therapist, only I cannot contact her at the moment as I live abroad (but I will go back home for the holidays - that's part of why I want to enjoy them so badly: they are a moment I treasure in general, not just for the food).

What can I do? How can I move on from here? Is it too much to ask to just be able to eat REALLY unrestricted for that period of time?",1576590764,12/17/2019 7:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ebw21t/request_how_to_face_christmas_holidays_and_eat/,3
1993,ebw1ze,Request: My ex has an eating disorder and I don’t know what to do,"So me and this girl were dating for about four months. Over the summer we we became best friends before we started dating and then once the school year started things changed. We both immediately got involved in school activities. She was the lead in the musical and we just didn’t see each other as much because we go to different schools. 
We were still strong but things were definitely different. We were still in love but she said she was upset things were different. We went through a weird week where we kinda broke up and tried to be friends but we still loved each other so that didn’t work out. Eventually we broke up for real even though we both didn’t want to. She said it was because of mental health reasons and because I wanted her to get better I kept my distance and didn’t ask questions. Recently we started talking again and I learned that she has been struggling with an eating disorder.
I’m sure she’s had this for a while but I was too stupid to notice. She talks about her body a lot and has a distorted view of how large she is. She is short but in great shape. I always thought she was perfect but she made several comments on how fat she is. 
She mentioned to me that she has a goal weight and that she will stop starving herself once she gets there. She mentioned not eating for days and throwing up several times. I don’t think she will stop once she reaches that weight and she has put herself on an impossible timeline. 
So here’s my problem, I don’t know what to do. I still love her and now that we’re starting to be friends again I’m happy, but this makes me sick to even think about. The suffering she must go through hurts me so much and she doesn’t think it’s a problem. She admits everything about throwing up but thinks it’s fine. She has a friend who has anorexia and I think they feed off each other. I want to be with her but I don’t want to put myself through seeing her like that. Above all else I want her to be happy and hearing what she does hurts me so much. 
She used to eat with me while we were dating but now a majority of her calories comes from vodka. I feel like I’m restricted in helping her because I don’t want us to fall back into love before she’s healthy but at the same time I can’t help her without being closer. She has a shitty family support system, her friends won’t help her, and she won’t see a therapist because then everyone will know. I don’t know what to do. I could tell her mom but then I think she will just resent me. Right now I think my best bet is being close friends again and just being a support system so she doesn’t have to drink every night but I don’t know if that’s good for me.

1994,ebw1ee,Request: Spiralling and struggling with recovery from my ED.,"This is my first time posting on here and I’ve wanted too for a while but it’s taken a lot of time and courage to actually do it, a lot of emotions going on right now.
I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa 2 years ago and I nearly didn’t make it but an incredibly supportive family got me through the fight. I’ve been in a constant battle with the recovery ever since, I’ve relapsed that many times over this past year alone that I’ve lost count.

Nearly 8 months ago I got into a relationship with the most amazing human ever, he truly is the best thing that’s ever happened to me and every day I can’t believe how supportive and understanding he is of my struggle with my eating disorder. I truly do want to take further steps into recovery and get better, not just for me but for him and for our future together. I’m really spiralling right now and I’m so close to slipping back into my true eating disorder ways and I want more than anything for that not to happen.
I guess I’m posting on here because I’m really scared right now and I want to truly get better once and for all and conquer this recovery. Because if I don’t I’ll lose my life and my love. I’ll do everything in my power not to let that happen but I don’t think I’m strong enough to do it alone. 
Thank you for taking the time to read this guys, every single person on this subreddit is phenomenal and we are all going to overcome all of this and it will never ever hold us or our lives back ever again.",1576590682,12/17/2019 7:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ebw1ee/request_spiralling_and_struggling_with_recovery/,8
1995,ebw1c1,Request: Did I cause irreversible damage to my body with my eating disorder which lasted 3 months?,"I (17 year old male) had an eating disorder for 3 months when I was 11. I was underweight, but after these 3 months I recovered quickly and I have been a healthy weight for 6 years now. I have been looking up the long term effects of an eating disorder and found an article from 1986 in which growth and puberty was studied from 19 children. It said most of them had delayed puberty, and in some of them hypogonadism persisted after recovery.

I remember when I had the eating disorder I did not grow for a while, but after recovery I slowly started growing again and went through puberty at age 11. I am now very tall and taller than everyone in my family. I looked up the symptoms of hypogonadism and I seem to have none of them.

Is it safe to say that I did not cause irreversible damage to my body? I have talked with my doctor about this and he told me I should be fine but since there are people in this sub who have suffered from eating disorders themselves and have more experience with this I am posting this here.",1576590672,12/17/2019 7:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ebw1c1/request_did_i_cause_irreversible_damage_to_my/,2
1996,ebw19n,Request: post: recently diagnosed,"So, I recently came to terms with the fact that I have a full blown ED. Got diagnosed anorexia purging type. Was always a self harmer, stopped for the most part and then boom, I shifted to something else I could control. I have grown up with parents who comment on my weight, and a mother who is proud of how little she eats (I would say man I’ve only had eggs and toast today and she’d say I haven’t eaten anything yet today. She’d comment on my clothes fitting tighter. Or my dad would walk by when I was eating something and say “You know where that’s going, right?”)

I gained a little weight after I graduated from college, I was a normal on the slightly smaller side weight, but definitely a healthy one, and once I gained a little bit of weight, the comments from my folks returned.

I started playing in a band, and something that really impacted me was that photographers take photos of you and you have no say whether or not you want a picture of you on the internet. It really fucked with my head and caused a spiral and I started playing scale games (well, I hit this weight, what if I hit this one? Oh I hit it! Let’s go further.) I feel myself get power off of being hungry. I set my calorie limits lower and lower, and I completely stopped eating around people. I wait until the very last moment I can to consume something and give in, and I absolutely cannot eat before a certain time, or out with friends or even my partner. If I eat now, well, then I can’t eat later. If I skip this now, I can eat later. Oh, it’s later? Well maybe I’ll just wait longer.  My entire day is focused on calorie intake, I chew my food and spit it out and I will throw food outside or cover it in dish soap. That’s been a thing for a while. I just keep challenging myself to get lower and lower because to me, I need to be lower. 

I lost a significant amount of weight in the last two years, to the point where friends and family have shown concern, but I just tell them it’s stress. 

I started purging about 6 months ago and told myself it was temporary, I felt like it’s not a real problem because it’s only been 6 months, and I’m being extremely dramatic.

My bandmate caught on on tour and I opened up to him after some whiskey, and sometimes regret it. He caught me purging recently and it was humiliating. He’s been incredibly supportive, but I’m constantly either feeling hopeless and scared of dying, but I have a stronger part of myself that just feels a drive to keep going because I’m not in the hospital and I’ve got it under control.  I can’t make up my mind on recovery because I’m facing  this giant wall, and I know it’s going to take so much energy to climb, and I am scared to gain even an ounce, or not be able to go lower. I have a therapist who I see weekly, and she told me if I keep up she’s not going to be able to treat me and said she would recommend me to inpatient. 

I miss food. I miss eating and enjoying it and not doing a count in my head or putting it in my journal to calculate later. I feel like there’s an imaginary hand pinning me down. I told my partner recently and he was crushed. 

Here’s what this rambling post is I guess asking for: How do you tell people what you need? I feel shaky, I hate myself and how I look all of the time, and I don’t know what to tell my best friend or my partner what I need, because I don’t know what I need. I don’t know how to tell those around me that I do not want someone forcing me to keep the bathroom doors open, or force me to sit at the table, because that just makes me scared and I’ll just figure something else out. How do you ask for what you need in recovery? What was the most helpful thing your partner/friend/etc do for you in recovery? I’m being asked, and I am so lucky to have these two in my life, but I don’t know what to ask for.

1999,ebw0oy,Request: My history of eating disorder and gym membership,"Note: Sorry, it turned out waaay longer than I thought it would be, but putting it all in the message turned out to be extremely refreshing. 

Everything started about 4 years ago. I was very obese (I was overweight - obese since my teens, but that was the highest point) and l started to feel that my weight gives me too much trouble, so I've decided to drop some of it. First it was some form of portion control, 1 year in I discovered calorie counting. I have counted for ~1 year, and results (weight wise) were amazing, first time in~15 years I was in the healthy weight range. Wonderful, isn't it? Turns out, it isn't.

I was binging too often, I was overexercising, I was blaming myself for being lazy if I won't have some kind of exercise once a day, for having some ""bad"" food. On top of that all I was working at shitty workplace with too many nosy people around.

I've tried to dismiss all the red flags at first, but after some time I've became suicidal (mostly because of shitty workplace, but I think my eating disorders contributed to it too), like ""I know how much time is left for me"" suicidal. I went all in.

I've changed my wokplace, changed my profession, and made an appointment to psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but my psychiatrist tried to avoid all my talk about my clearly ED behaviours. Maybe, he was right to do it? Nowadays I don't think it will be a good idea to bring focus to ED. Even though I left a bit frustrated, first time in so long I was also hopeful.

Fast forward to now, I'm clearly in much better place - I'm not suicidal, I much more confident and calmer and refer to my antidepressants as ""+75% bullshit resistance pills"". Problem is - I gained weight. A lot. I'm not at my highest points, but it's already pretty uncomfortable - moving is a struggle, tying shoes hurts, etc. I haven't went to the gym even once in half a year. I want to change, I want to be physically comfortable in my body. 

So I've bought a gym membership. I've said myself that I won't be focusing on losing weight, just on becoming stronger, so I've told my story to the coach, so she will be aware of why I'm so opposed to focusing on my weight. She was very understanding and nice about it. But then I needed to go through gym doctor checkup. And it wasn't pleasant at all, starting from her question about my goal (my answer that I want to be strong, nimble, toned and would be nice if I lost some weight in the process shortened to ""losing weight"" in her notes) to ""I understand that you don't want to focus on your weight, but you need to be aware of your problem, you need to lose weight"" (yes, this is one of the most colourful examples of everything before ""but"" is bs). Also, she tried to force me to buy her dieting consultation program, but I'm not really well off and she acted pretty toxic, so... No, tyvm. I left that checkup feeling really uneasy and nervous.
I've went to the gym the next day (without personal coach) and it was ok, but I haven't been doing any ""challenging"" stuff so gym staff wasn't noticing me much.
Today I went again (again, without coach - like I said, I'm not well off to afford all these nice things out of the blue), but decided to try deadlifts - I was dreaming that one day I'll be brave enough to try them. 

Uh-oh. I've attracted attention of one of the coaches. I decided to not tell my story to one more person, so, in his defence, he had no idea about my struggles and he tried to be very delicate. In short, he said how I should lose weight before I try some challenging stuff.

So, that time I also left the gym shaken. I don't know, who is in the wrong? Maybe, I should listen to them? Or not? What should I do and say in those situations? How should I approach my ""opening"" to people when it's clearly needed?

Thank you for listening to my rant.",1576590564,12/17/2019 7:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ebw0oy/request_my_history_of_eating_disorder_and_gym/,3

2004,e9md3h,Request: Online Survey for ED research,"Hello, 
My name is Jemma Olson, I am conducting research for my Masters in Clinical Psychology at the University of New England. My research is aiming to better understand healthy eating and exercise behaviours in relation to eating disorders. Unfortunately, eating disorders do not represent the majority of individual experiences and are often misdiagnosed. Results from my research will hopefully produce a greater understanding of the common eating and exercise behaviour of a wide variety of individuals to reduce misdiagnoses. I would greatly appreciate if you would be able to circulate the below message for my online survey to your followers as a way of allowing my research to appropriately represent the public. 


Do you worry about what you eat? Or how much you exercise? Do you spend lots of time meal planning or thinking about portion sizes?

Researchers at the University of New England, are looking for participants over the age of 18 – please click https://unesurveys.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cx1Mg3chFa5stKZ to participate 

This study explores different patterns of eating and exercising behaviours of Australian adults.
The survey takes approx. 30 mins to complete (and you can save your responses and finish it later!). You will also have the option to enter an email address and be invited to complete a short 10-15 minute survey 3 weeks later.
All responses remain anonymous and confidential 
and your responses will not be tied to your email address

2005,e9mcen,Request: Going it alone + family issues,"21(f) with a restrictive (and sometimes binge/purge) ED. So far that's all I've been told - my GP refuses to get more specific in terms of types of ED as he's not a specialist. Currently I have a severely underweight BMI but my blood tests have come back pretty normal aside from low-level anaemia (I'm also vegetarian). So basically, I'm having to go this alone. I can't afford a therapist and the uni ones don't deal with EDs. My GP referred me to a dietitian but they came back saying I'm not sick enough yet. I've also found out recently that my big sister has an ED and we both think that our parents have issues with food too (compulsive weighing, deliberately restricting, viewing foods as good and bad, compulsive exercising, guilt after eating, compensating for eating). For this reason, neither of us want to tell them about our EDs because we think it will make theirs worse, especially as they don't seem to realise they have any problems. One thing this has made me realise though is that I have no idea what a healthy relationship with food looks like. I've tried to recover alone before but always end up feeling stumped and completely lost. I don't have any goals to work towards and I'm scared I'll just end up in quasi-recovery. So my question is, what are attitudes/behaviours I can work towards? What should I be aiming for? Are there any traps I should look  out for?

2007,efnt3e,Request: Possible admission,"Hello there! Merry Christmas 😊
I was hoping you could maybe post this up, titled baby steps. Thanks so much in advance x

Christmas time can be pretty overwhelming, if you overthink what food you will be/expected to eat its fairly easy to just want to stay away from the festivities altogether.

Ive never been good at finishing my Christmas Dinner, when I was younger it would often be because of excitement/family issues/personal issues. The whole process of making the dinner and then eventually all sitting down to eat. 

In the more recent years where I've recognised my eating disorder I realise immediately the pressure of finishing my food is overwhelming and I'm suddenly not even slightly hungry. Previous years this will make me turn to old Mia, eating as much as I can get away with from my dinner and then going to the bathroom and getting rid. This would leave me with the most overwhelming shame. As a family we made this dinner, and for what?

This year, however, I've managed to eat not all of my dinner, but all of what I've ate has stayed. Its not something Ive thought about until an hour after sat with a baileys and I'm like oh yeah, I used to feel the need to do that and you know what I'm okay for it this year. Who knows I might stumble down the hill next year and slip but you know what that's fine, swings and roundabouts.

I hope you're not having an overwhelming one, if it feels so, try to remember that people care for you and love you.

2009,ef8ztv,Request: triggers you can’t avoid?,"So I’m not sure where I’m going with this but I feel pretty alone in this and have been feeling like this for years now.
Both me and my sister have an eating disorder. I lived with my parents at the time it started and she was going abroad, focusing on her studies, career, etc.
Since I was in high school still, my parents were able to ‘force’ me to go into an inpatient treatment (not really force because the end decision was mine, but I felt I had no other choice).
In hindsight it was the best decision, as it got me far, but even now, after being discharged for 4 years, I’m where I want to be. I know it’s not my sister’s fault, but I do find her eating disorder to be a huge trigger for me. During treatment they dismissed this as she wasn’t diagnosed, so they thought it was something I ‘made up’ or led myself to believe.
But now there’s really no denying her eating disorder. She has admitted it herself and has been going to therapists and healers on and off for the last two years or so. 
This is of course a great improvement, but I can’t help but feel triggered by her eating disorder. She is still controlling her food meticulously, exercising a lot and maintaining a very low weight/bodyfat %.
Judging by my clothing I know I’m not fat, but every time I see her I feel like I want/need to lose weight and relapse. I’m having a hard time letting go of this when I feel like I’m twice her size.
People generally say to avoid triggers, but I love my sister and will not shut her out of my life.


Sorry this is such a long post, but what I’m meaning to ask is: does anything have a similar experience and tips on how to deal with this? I really don’t want to relapse and want to get fully recovered, but feel like this is holding me back so much.",1577231142,12/24/2019 17:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ef8ztv/request_triggers_you_cant_avoid/,6

I am a college student and in recovery for almost 6 months. At school, I am pretty busy and active. I have been working on eating more intuitively but still am pretty structured with what I eat. I still deal with chewing and spitting especially when stressed.

For some reason when I get home I fall back into old habits of bingeing/chewing and spitting a ton. It’s especially hard this time of year when we have a ton of pie and desserts in general lying around. I also feel generally more lethargic and sort of trapped because I can’t spend a ton of time outside and have to drive most places so I’m a lot less active. I’ve found trying to keep my days productive- I.e going to the gym and going and working on applications/other stuff for school, helps but it’s really easy to fall into being lazy and engaging in disordered behavior and the more i do it the harder it is to break the cycle.",1577184644,12/24/2019 4:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/eezw93/request_what_helps_you_with_handling/,2

She’s a ballet dancer and so has always been in good shape. I wouldn’t categorise her as looking overly underweight, she just has a slim frame. I’m worried that if she continues she will end up falling to an unhealthy weight and potentially becoming seriously ill. My mum is aware of what’s going on but she isn’t a confrontational person and so tries to avoid conflict around the subject, meaning she rarely brings it up to her.

2015,edune7,Request: Concerned about my husband,"A couple of years ago my husband became a strict vegetarian (largely for ethical reasons; in other words, I don’t necessarily suspect that it was triggered by an ED). He has always been a bigger guy and it took awhile for weight to really start falling off of him. In the beginning he was eating a lot of carbs which also contributed to him maintaining a fairly similar weight to what he had in the past.

Recently, perhaps in the past six months, I have started to become worried about his eating habits. When we are at home, he eats in a way that I would say is fairly normal: stir-frying vegetables, ordering pizza, cooking some meatless frozen products/meat substitutes, etc. He works from home and occasionally he will get busy during lunch and skip it, but seems to catch up with a bigger dinner in the evening. When we are out, however- on vacation, at a friend’s house, basically anything that isn’t our normal routine- it seems like he gets really picky about what he is eating and it feels like if anything “goes wrong” about the meal, he doesn’t eat. It’s hard to explain what I mean, but basically it seems almost like he is looking for reasons not to eat. Our friends/family and I try really hard to be accommodating of his diet (much to his chagrin, because he feels like it’s a big fuss being made over him) so it’s not at all that he doesn’t have vegetarian options available. But even still it seems like he often finds reasons not to eat, and can string multiple skipped meals together (usually not more than two). The best way I can describe it is that it almost seems like he has a budding adversarial relationship towards food that manifests itself when he is forced out of the food routine he has at home. He has now dropped a considerable amount of weight, although he isn’t underweight for his size (but it’s noticeable to anybody who knows him).

I’ve tried to do some online research about signs of an ED in men but his situation doesn’t seem to fit a lot of the examples I found. I feel like for every point in favor of my concern, there’s a counterpoint that indicates maybe it isn’t a problem. I want to talk to him about it, and I’m willing to, but I don’t want to go into the conversation uninformed, especially because I am reasonably certain that he’s going to react at least initially with defensiveness. I was wondering if anybody has experience with this type of situation and what my next step should be to try to suss out if this is becoming a problem.",1576958886,12/21/2019 14:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/edune7/request_concerned_about_my_husband/,9

2021,ecrs3n,"Request: I know my eating habits are disordered, but I dont know how to act.","I dont really know what advice I am seeking. I tried many different things: calorie counting, intuitive eating, intermittent fasting, 6 small meals throughout the day... After a couple of weeks at most, I fall back to my old unhealthy habits. 

Just to give you a recent example: Yesterday, I ate a big mealfor lunch, while having my usual big breakfast and big dinner. Today, I was craving something sweet, so after my usual big breakfast, I went to the store and bought some coconut and chocolate granola... and ate the whole pack of 500 grams. 
I will eat my normal lunch, I guess. I will eat until I feel physically sick. 

I know this is unhealthy. When I am not in this downward-spiral, but in my ""good weeks"", I would describe myself as healthy: healthy weight, going regularly to the gym, usually eating a healthy diet with a healthy distribution between carb, fat and protein. My period sometimes makes me go wild food-wise because during the days right before and at the beginning of my period my food choices are hella weird. 

I dont want to say crazy to not trivialize mental illnesses but it has been really disturbing to say the least, and the last few months, my eating habits got even worse and I didnt really recognize a connection to my period whatsoever. I am having finals this month, but this behavior started almost a year ago, so there is no direct connection either.

I am disgusted by myself and my habits, I am feeling confused and helpless. I have a partner who supports me in all aspects of life, but I dont want to share this with them. 

My main focus isnt weight loss. As I said, I actually am at a healthy weight, but probably only because I restrict myself 3 days a week because of my disturbing behavior during the other 4 days. And I train a lot. This surely helps not gaining too much. I am also not so much worried about the calories consumed, but my behavior around food. Eating whole packages of pasta or granola, only for my SO not to find them and confront me because I can throw the package away as if it never happened. I am in denial of the copious amounts of food I ate as soon as the package is gone, even if I am feeling physically sick for the rest of the day.

How do I approach this? Is it necessary to see a therapist? Should I just wait until after my exams? They are the biggest exams I have had in my life and are determining for my professional direction. 

TLDR I eat copious amounts of food until I am feeling physically sick on a regular basis. How do I approach this?",1576753695,12/19/2019 5:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ecrs3n/request_i_know_my_eating_habits_are_disordered/,2

He’s on an ng tube and is steadily regaining weight. I’m happy with where he’s at considering the services available to us right now. 

His diagnosis so far seems to be PANDAS or OCD and anorexia. He’s been put on anti anxiety meds and a sedative which have helped to calm his panic surrounding food immensely. 

He has said that he’s worried about germs in his mouth or crumbs getting stuck in his teeth or having too much energy and going too fast. 

I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice on how I could talk to him about this. We’ve tried being logical which usually helps but not so much now.

The problem is, I love doing this. It makes me feel happy and in control and I don’t want to get better. I want to keep going until I’m at a weight I’m happy with. Everyone who I know is encouraging me and complimenting me on my weight loss, which is making it even harder.

If I wasn’t suffering loads of side effects I wouldn’t be asking right now, but I am having enough that I’m seriously concerned, it’s beyond just sickness, weakness and exhaustion now. I feel like I’m going to faint when I move to quickly when I haven’t eaten, I’m usually lightheaded and the world seems to swim in this strange way like nothing’s quite stable.

2034,eh4wtn,Request: Concerned About My ED Negatively Influencing SO," 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (28M) for about 6 months now and we are both doing very well both in our relationship and in our own personal spheres. Feelings are talked about a lot and everything is open to discuss. Recently we’ve both been under a *lot* of stress due to the holiday season, and our respective ED have started to make an appearance in our daily habits, without either of us really realizing until the past couple of days.

I have been battling anorexia for as long as I can remember. At some point in college I began intermittent fasting as well as intuitive eating, which I still revert to during times of stress or helplessness. I unintentionally reverted back to these habits during the holidays, and unfortunately have lost a noticeable amount of weight.

My boyfriend has battled bulimia for over a decade and still falls into the “chew and spit” routine occasionally. He was overweight as a child which has caused him to have severe body dysmorphia as an adult. He lost a lot of weight last year from changing his diet and habits, and he fears that he won’t be able to keep it off. He’s been binging a lot, and I’ve caught him chewing and spitting today.

We’ve talked about our respective disorders and linked behaviors, and we feel confident going into 2020 as a unit that we’ll be able to stay on the right path, but I have fears for myself. A big part of why my habits are so dangerous is that I don’t even realize that I haven’t eaten for multiple days until someone points it out to me. I don’t notice the weight falling off until my bones are jutting out of my skin, and at that point it’s already gone too far. I genuinely don’t know how to fix this without setting an alarm for each meal.

My boyfriend is awesome and checks on me regularly to make sure I’ve been eating, which is extremely helpful, but *he shouldn’t have to*. I also have started fearing that my unhealthy habits are pushing him closer to his own disorder-based habits because he’s began chewing and spitting again. He has a poor self-image due to body dysmorphia, and I don’t want him to start hurting himself because I’m hurting myself.",1577618516,12/29/2019 5:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/eh4wtn/request_concerned_about_my_ed_negatively/,2

I am currently dating a girl who I already know I love (even though it hasn't been too long).  I've never felt so strongly about a person in my life.  We both have type 1 diabetes, so I feel like I can connect with her on a deeper level that I haven't found with anyone else.  She also suffers from an eating disorder, so I want to know how to help her as best I can, so I thought I'd go to reddit of course!
I'm not sure what she suffers from exactly, but she isn't bulimic, anorexic, and does not suffer from binge eating (those are the only three eating disorders that I know of), though I know eating disorders can come in many forms and at varying levels of severity.  Her issues seem to pop up at different times, especially the holidays.  I usually let her vent to me about it and just listen and comfort her, but I want to take it to the next step.  I don't want to simply help her cope with it, but also be able to actually help her overcome it.
She seems to feel anxious and guilty about eating at certain times.  She's extremely fit and loves working out and has a fantastic body, but she seems to have a skewed view of her own body.  Most of the time, she's very good at getting rid of her i-need-to-be-skinnier-right-now thoughts, and she feels most in control when going to the gym and working out.  Her anxiety and guilt pops up most when she eats out a lot or indulges in a lot of food, two things that happen a lot during holiday season.

2036,eh4scv,Request: am i developing ed?,"For my whole life, I’ve always been overweight. Some time ago, I moved out, my daily routine changed and I started loosing weight without even trying. I assumed it was because I stopped drinking sweet drinks and was busy most of the time. I lost some weight and was not overweight anymore, according to BMI.
This year, I am studying in a foreign country. As it is more expensive here, I developed a habit of eating only 2 meals per day and some snacks. Also some stress was added and because of that I was able to eat only one meal a day sometimes. 
Another thing is, that cooking here is almost impossible for me. Options for what to eat are not that various. That sometimes makes me overeat, when I finally can eat something different and I only feel sick afterwards, which makes my mood drop and I feel bad, almost depressed.
I lost 7 kilos in 4 months. I am still in the healthy weight range and I like that I lost more weight but I am worried I lost weight too quickly. I don’t really worry about my weight that much, only that when I go back home, I will have to be careful to not gain all the weight back quickly.

Everybody was telling me how great I looked and how I should keep up the good work. They didn't know...they didn't know what it took to look ""great"". They didn't know how I hadn't eaten for 2 days. All they knew was I was that I ""looked"" fantastic and honestly I don't think they would have cared if they knew. But one day, I decided to change. I decided that I wanted to stop this before I went to the hospital for the pain because I didn't want anyone to know. So, I ate and ate and ate and for a while it was great. I was getting a lot better. Then people started telling me I needed to watch myse lf. That I shouldn't ""let myself go"". They didn't know that I had starved myself to keep myself at that weight but it hurt either way. Here I was trying to get better and these people are unknowingly telling me to go back to that. I ignored them and I would eat to comfort myself. I didn't know what I was doing was just another form of what I had hated. I didn't know that binging was an ED. So I ate and I ate and I didn't stop. Which got me to my now highest weight. I feel like a failure. Everybody keeps commenting on how big I am and it hurts. About how I look ugly and that I need to go back to how I was. I had let myself go to this point and thought I was doing myself a favor by eating for comfort. Instead of developing a healthy relationship with food I just did the opposite of what I was doing. I get called out every day for my weight. It has started to affect me and some of my old habits are coming back. I can't love myself or my body.  I just want to wish it all away but I can't.",1577578285,12/28/2019 18:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/egykpv/request_my_story/,4
2040,egprrn,Request: How to Better Help SO,"In the past week or so, I noticed that my BF has been hyper focusing on his weight and eating habits. Since the beginning of us dating, he has mentioned on and off how he used to be fitter and 40-50lbs lighter and wants to lose some of the weight he’s gained. To add context, at his lowest weight he was extremely skinny for his height, and he’s still relatively skinny now. As someone who works out on a very regular basis, I have always been supportive of being active and eating healthier. I keep on telling him he doesn’t need to lose weight but that if he wants to be healthier, I’m all for it.

Now to add context, I use working out and staying active as a way to keep old disordered eating habits I have under control. It prevents me from wanting to starve myself, and I’ve equipped myself with enough knowledge to know how achieve my own personal goals. Through knowledge and therapy, I have been in a relatively steady recovery for about 3 years. 

The reason why I state this is because I’m beginning to worry that even though he has only known me in my recovery, that I’m influencing him negatively. He tried purging, and I had to talk him down from it. I’ve been able to keep a steady, clear mind about this but he even told me he’s never felt the need to do this and doesn’t know why he felt that way. I’m concerned about him. I don’t know if this is related to a mental health issue he already struggles with (anxiety related) or if it’s something else. 

I don’t know how to bring it up with him or if I should at all. As someone who has struggled with pretty severe disordered eating habits, I know when people would point out the fact I wasn’t eating, I would just find better ways to do it. 

Is this something I should talk to him about? Has anyone struggled with something similar?",1577532573,12/28/2019 5:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/egprrn/request_how_to_better_help_so/,1
2041,egppqk,Request: seeking advice for dealing with body dysmorphia during the christmas period,"

i’m a 21 y/o girl and i’m very reluctantly weight restored after struggling with anorexia for around 8 years. 
as with most people with EDs, the christmas period is my idea of a living hell. this has been my first christmas in a number of years where i’ve regained somewhat “normal” eating habits so i’ve tried to let myself eat what i want.. and the guilt has been almost unbearable. i’m pretty newly weight restored (since around septemberish) but i’m still struggling to overcome an exercise addiction - however i’m in my final year of university and the past few weeks i’ve been too busy to find time to go to the gym, and that was really my only coping mechanism. the past couple of weeks have been scrutinising in terms of body image because of the indulgent food and lack of exercise, to the point i don’t even want to take a shower because my body dysmorphia is so bad. i’ve been avoiding going outside because i don’t want anybody to see me, and baggy clothes haven’t been helping because i still feel like i look big. I can’t help but feel like my whole body is crawling because of how bad i feel that it looks. 
does anybody have maybe any tips on coping with body dysmorphia during this period or ways i can reassure myself? I can’t help but feel ive changed so much during the month of december and it’s eating me alive.",1577532128,12/28/2019 5:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/egppqk/request_seeking_advice_for_dealing_with_body/,5

I also eat when I'm dehydrated? Like I eat and eat and eat...and finally after even more food and feeling ""full"" it clicks in my head 'go drink some
 water!!'

2053,elr3zg,Request: My mom has fueled my ED for years and I need advice,"Title basically says it all. I haven’t been ever diagnosed with an eating disorder properly, but you can judge my behavior and make your own analysis. 

I have and awful relationship with food and eating around people. For as long as I could remember, my mom would be the one to shame me in front of the family for my choices at the table. Whether it would be getting a second serving, etc. Now, I was a slightly chunky child, but it wasn’t anything extreme. I had baby fat. I wasn’t obese, and I grew out of it. But she would always make me watch shows like The Biggest Loser, modify my diet, punish me for eating sweets, and hovered over the scale like a hawk. It was big and little things. I remember once when I got my braces tightened, it hurt to eat. She’d continuously joke that I should get them tightened more often. Hell, I overheard that she joked about my severe anemia because she thought it’d make me lose more weight. 

She put me on MyFitnessPal and similar apps from a young age, and when I was 14 pressured me into going to see a weight loss specialist (Dr. Zisman, Miami, if you care to look into him) , who put me on metabolism boosting pills and a strict diet. I proceeded to lose a bunch of weight, and my mom was happy, but I was utterly miserable. 

I turned to purging, and restricting, and binging. I sneak food, whether it’s hiding bread in my hoodie sleeve or an orange in the band of my underwear. Eating dinner with family members gives me extreme anxiety, as does eating around other people. My best friend is the only person who I really feel all that comfortable eating around, because deep down I know she wouldn’t judge me like my mother. 

When I came clean to her about my ex-purging habits, she didn’t bat an eye. She makes weight loss a condition for doing things that I like. For example, to go see my best friend in Iceland, she wants me to lose x amount of pounds by x date. 

I should clarify that I don’t hate my mom, but she’s left me with a deeply scarred sense of self and I fear that I’ll never be able to truly love myself at any size. She’s ruined my relationship with food and with my body, but at the same time I feel bad because it’s not her fault. My abuelo died from complications of lung cancer and diabetes, and my abuela is obese. Being overweight runs in the family, and she often talks about being the only one to have “broken the mold” by being skinny. She has baggage and she’s scared that I’ll turn out to be 500 pounds or something. 

I’m NOT skinny by most standards, and I just wish I had smaller boobs and a thigh gap and thinner arms and a smaller...well, a smaller everything. I’m so tired of obsessing over calories, feeling overly guilty for having an indulgent meal or not working out, and being ashamed of my body. I get so envious of people who have my “ideal” body. 

I feel like I’ve had much of my childhood and teenage years robbed from me because of my maybe-ED. 

To anybody who’s been in a similar situation to me, I really need advice. I’m stuck and I feel so hopeless.",1578480069,1/8/2020 4:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/elr3zg/request_my_mom_has_fueled_my_ed_for_years_and_i/,18
2054,elr3ki,Request: post title: poverty and food?,"Hi,

I want to preface this by saying I haven't been professionally diagnosed with an eating disorder but this is the best place I could find where people may be able to relate to me. If there are any other subreddits that better suit this please let me know.

I'm 18F about to start my second semester in college. My immediate family (mother and siblings) has always struggled financially. There are times where we didn't have any food in the house or didn't know when we'd be able to get food again. My mother is a little irresponsible with money and tended to splurge on things like McDonald's, food from delivery apps etc. As I got older I became more aware of how our finances looked and how it might have been better long term for her to buy groceries or something instead of spending 30 bucks on delivery - but when I brought it up she'd get mad at me for implying she was irresponsible. Not to mention I liked the food we got. So that created a weird relationship with food for me already.

I don't have a good relationship with my mother. In my high school years I got closer to my aunt. She's made comments on my weight before as I am slightly overweight and I have high sugar intake, and diabetes runs in my family. It put a strain on my relationship with her but when we discussed it more in-depth she laid off for a good couple of years.

I've been living with my aunt for about a year now, and I'm home for winter break. I have my own job now, I've built up my savings a LOT and set more limits for myself, but my mom still struggles financially.

My aunt brought up my sugar intake (not so much my weight but she heavily implied it) for the first time in a few years last week. I still order a lot of delivery when she's not home, like taco Bell and TGI Fridays and dominos but I cover up the containers so she won't see it, since she's not afraid to speak her mind and I don't want to hear it. So even now she doesn't know the full extent of my eating habits.

I try to be more responsible by buying things from grocery stores and eating in (even when I'm on campus) and choosing healthier options, but now that I have my own money, it feels good to order out. I like getting junk food and shoving my face and knowing I can afford it. But now that I'm gaining more weight I have a completely different kind of guilt. My aunt isnt ""well off"" but she saves well and has money to spare and helps me financially since my mother is incapable. I don't take advantage of her because like I said, I have my own job and money, but I have a stable adult in my life and a steady roof to live under. Now I can't help myself. I order so much shit and overeat just because I can and honestly sometimes I get scared I won't be able to anymore.

Has anybody else experienced this weird up and down? I know the interaction between financial status and eating habits can differ, but I feel like I'm alone sometimes.",1578479991,1/8/2020 4:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/elr3ki/request_post_title_poverty_and_food/,2

2060,ekshsf,Request: stuck in a cycle and I don't know how to get out," 

I think even if I don't fit the criteria for ed, that my eating has been disordered for a long time. I was 11 when I restricted my eating for the first time. It started after trauma happened and became my coping strategy and much more.

If I was anxious I felt nauseous so I wouldn't eat, if I was scared of sitting alone, if I got into trouble by a teacher or was upset I'd 'punish' myself by not eating but I couldn't keep it up for long.

Pretty soon I was raiding the fridge at night after restricting all day because I felt like I deserved it. My mum said I was 'stealing' by having food from the fridge at night without asking and that caused further guilt and Shame. I started to restrict at school and binge at home so nobody was the wiser. When I gave in I felt disgusting. I couldn't and still struggle to look at myself in the mirror.

It got worse, and my clothes started dropping off. People come ted that I looked great and it turned me even though I started wearing belts to keep my trousers from falling down. I purged after every meal. I spit my food out into a cup, I took ages to eat and played with my food. This happened for a good six months but I developed a fear of being sick and stopped purging. Instead just binging and feeling guilty so restricting.

I make it a game to see how long I can heal with the hunger pangs even now. I like having them. I keep pictures of anorexic people and unhealthy quotes on my phone. I used to surf pro Ana and pro Mia websites for tips.

Now almost 13 years later I'm obese after a hormone problem and binging led to a sudden rapid weight gain. I eat one or two meals a day and I still stay the same weight. I'm picky with my foods due to having autism and with chronic pain, I find it hard to exercise. I feel no matter what I do It just doesn't help.

I did decide to try weight watchers a few years ago as my doctor is concerned for my health due to being overweight and I am too. The only time I lost any weight was eating soup for every meal every day. I became obsessed with calories and would panic because I like to know everything exactly, how much butter am I spreading on this sandwich?

2061,eksgr8,"Request: Submission: I'm worried I might be on the path to relapse, and I need advice/help (Trigger Warnings)","Hi. It's my first time really posting something like this, and my first time really doing a whole reddit post in the first place. I hope you bear with me as I'm not totally well versed in the ""reddit ways."" Anyway, into the knitty gritty.
I'm a freshman at a small university in the midwest, and it's my first time ""living"" on my own, albeit in a dorm. Usually when I've been in danger of relapsing, I'd have my cat to comfort me, but seeing as I'm now 400+ miles away from home, that's not an option, and I know its a crutch, and now that I'm an adult I need better coping skills. However, I'm surrounded by these beautiful girls with next to perfect bodies, and I'm just the same frumpy girl I've always been, more overweight and stretch-marked than ever (I weigh more than I've weighed my entire life). I've also been going through a lot of family issues, with my father's health going way down the drain (He got sepsis, and also has severe cirrhosis of the liver and pancreas, as well as diabetes.) I guess I really hit the freshman fifteen, which really, REALLY sucks and fucks with my body image even more. The last time I felt okay with my body, I was 12, and deep in an eating disorder (anorexia and bulimia.) I've never had a boyfriend, and the only guy who ever saw me as something even remotely sexy was abusive and told me he was the best I would ever do, which was a serious issue. I'm still a virgin at 18 and haven't even ever kissed anyone, and I keep thinking that number is gonna get higher and higher until it's pathetic (and I KNOW I'm feeding into that whole societal time clock thing but I can't HELP it)
My roommate tells me I'm not fat, and I have a great body, and I'm carrying the ass for the both of us (she has a basically perfect body, her body is my body goals, and she eats so much worse than me), but then my male best friend tells me that I AM fat, and gives me advice to eat better and count calories, (which I do, and have done before, but it often ends up with me cutting more and more until I'm fasting unhealthily.) Now that the new year is coming, I, like so many others, have decided to be healthier, which means exercising and eating better than I have (I eat a lot of carbs.) 
The thing is, I've done this before, and I always end up going too much too far, and slip back into my ED past. I overexert my muscles, cut back on food, basically only eat salad, the portions getting smaller and smaller until it's basically nothing, or I don't see results fast enough and cut all food and just keep working out harder, which is even more unhealthy. The thing is, I can't help but think it's so much easier for me to  just sink back into that, because it was the only thing that actually worked for me. I can't help that nagging voice in the back of my head, that the ED patterns will be worth it, because they work, and I didn't have serious health concerns the last time I relapsed, so what's the deal? 
It especially sucks because I'm a psych major, I want to go into clinical, and I KNOW this type of thinking is bad, but I'm not far enough along with my studies to totally know how to deal with it, and I also hate bringing it up to my friends or family because it isn't their job, and I just want to focus on my schoolwork. But I also want to not be a ""kiss-virgin"" at age 25, which I know sounds pathetic to those of you with more experiences, and who think it's important to wait for someone who really loves and cares about me (which I agree with; but I still feel shitty.)
I feel like a giant whiny baby at the end of this, but I just had to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice for an overweight gal like me trying to get back to the 150-160 zone without going overboard and relapsing? I'd appreciate it so much. Thanks, so much, for any advice you have to me, and my first world shitty problems.",1578307331,1/6/2020 4:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/eksgr8/request_submission_im_worried_i_might_be_on_the/,2
2062,eksfb8,"Request: Binge eating, bulimia, and Vyvanse","Hi,

I’m new to Reddit so I’m not sure if this was posted before. I’m also cross posting to another eating disorder community because I feel very hopeless and alone right now. I have been battling with an eating disorder for almost a year and a half. I started a new job last April that is high stress (I work in a prison), but I was also dealing with bullying, sexual harassment, and workplace violence with coworkers. Prior to this job I had never experienced an eating disorder. I was working out regularly and training in rock climbing as well as aspiring to get onto American Ninja Warrior. I didn’t obsess over my body, but I made sure I was healthy and fit. I am a female. At the time 29 years old, 5’4”, I was in the normal BMI range, but low bf, and solid muscle. I went to third shift and my life spiraled from there. I stopped going to the gym, I started binge eating, and for the first time in my life I was throwing all of my food up. I saw a psych who prescribed Vyvanse off the rip and continued to up my dose when I told him that I was still binge eating and purging. I developed crushing insomnia. I sleep at most 2 hours a day even on my off days. He has prescribed every sleeping pill under the sun which doesn’t work so we stopped all of those. I’ve tried every anti-depressant on the market to no relief. Fast forward to now. I’m on 60mg Vyvanse, 300mg Wellbutrin, and still binging and purging roughly 3x a week. Still not sleeping and working up to 64 hours a week on third shift. I am not dealing with bullying anymore because I switched facilities, but I am suffering from the trauma and things still continuously trigger me. I just recently went to a GI for an Endoscopy because there was blood in my vomit. I am at a loss right now because I feel like the Vyvanse didn’t make anything better, it just made things worse. I am still in the healthy bmi range, but a higher  bf. I am constantly looking in the mirror, taking photos of myself, calling myself a fat pig, sometimes very sure that I will die of obesity. The depression and body dysmorphia are out of control. I am most likely going to rehab next week for the eating disorder if they deem it necessary, if not I start IOP. I’m just looking to talk to people with similar issues because I feel extremely alone. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t want to be here anymore, but I am too scared to do anything. It’s a feeling of continuous purgatory. I hope I am able to connect with at least one person. I have no one to talk to. I have no friends because my job took that from me. I am home by myself the majority of the time when I am not working. My family doesn’t understand my eating disorder and thinks it’s as simple as “not eating that food” or “not throwing up” and the best one, “just close your eyes and get rest”. I see a therapist as well that hasn’t helped at all. My job has intervened because I call out of work so much due to the panic attacks and bulimia so they’ve reached out to an eating disorder clinic for me. I know that’s a lot to read. If at least one person responds I would be very appreciative.",1578307072,1/6/2020 4:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/eksfb8/request_binge_eating_bulimia_and_vyvanse/,3

My college experience so far has been far from great. I'm currently a sophomore entering the spring semester, but I am being forced to take a break. Last year I was diagnosed with an eating disorder, and treatment has gotten in the way of maintaining a consistent ""college student experience"". I'm an out of state student struggling to accept the fact that I'm going to be missing out on so much. From being able to participate in my sorority's recruitment process, to having to turn down a chance to study abroad in May among other things, I'm feeling really lost and upset over the whole situation. In addition, I am worried about falling behind in classes and not being able to graduate on time.

2065,ekse6c,Request: Is this eating disorder?,"Hi everyone~


I've been accused of having ed by few people on reddit, so I just wanted to ask if you think that I have eating disorder. I don't think I do. 

I can eat normally, I don't feel guilty about eating junk food, and I don't obsess over calories. I look at calories at the store, so I do know approximately how many calories I eat. But I don't write them down, or use food scale or anything. I try to stay under certain number of calories, but sometimes I go over. I feel bad when I do, but not that bad. And sometimes, I do really well during the day, but at night I just eat stuff I shouldn't, even if I'm not that hungry. Around my family I can eat normally, but at rehabilitation I go to, I don't eat much. I can't really say why, but I don't want people there to think I eat a lot. I have tried fasting, but haven't fasted for more than 20 hours at once, so never for long. I take medication that can cause decreased appetite, and I have lied to my doctor when she has asked if I have experienced that. I know that one is probably bad, but I feared what she would do if I said yes. I don't want them to start monitoring my weight or eating. 

So I think my eating is/could be fine, I just want to be skinny. Or skinnier. I'm underweight now, but I'm just not happy with how I look. When I'm around people, I feel really tall and wide. Especially at my rehabilitation, everyone's so pretty and skinny, and I feel so ugly and fat compared to them. And this is stupid and weird, but I also want to be so skinny, that my counselor there gets worried about me. I don't know why.",1578306856,1/6/2020 4:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ekse6c/request_is_this_eating_disorder/,4
2066,eksdqx,Request: How do I stop this!? I’m so hungry all the time and it won’t go away!,"Ever since I started trying to recover, and ever since I started eating again, I’ve been SO HUNGRY. Most of the time it doesn’t ever stop except for when I’ve just finished a huge meal, and it starts again after an hour or so, if it stops at all. I’m always starving and I’d anything for food. It’s like this unstoppable desire.

I HATE IT. I hate it so much! It’s the worst feeling in the world and I want it to stop. I can’t just listen to it and eat everything or I’d gain back twice the amount of weight I’ve lost by carefully dieting for months.

I tried going back to barely eating again, but even that won’t help. I can make myself be extra careful all day and eat as close to nothing as possible. But then it all falls apart and I can’t stop myself eating, and I eat way more than I used to eat every day while before I tried to recover...

How do I make this stop? Please tell me there’s a way. I’ve tried starving myself again but it just makes the hunger worse. Do I just need more willpower to push through it and make sure I don’t eat anything? Am I even doing the right thing by trying to eat normally when all it does is make me feel like this? Why do I even have to recover? I don’t feel like there’s anything wrong with me. I felt so much happier before I started eating again. Everything has gone wrong for me since I stopped starving and I wished I’d never tried to stop.

I just don’t know what to do. Any advice is appreciated...",1578306784,1/6/2020 4:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/eksdqx/request_how_do_i_stop_this_im_so_hungry_all_the/,7

I was diagnosed with a general eating disorder as I had restricted food and increased exercise. since I’ve been in college (I am a sophomore) I haven’t been working out as intensely as I did when I was in high school, so naturally my body composition changed. this has been very hard for me and has increased my urge to go back to my old ways of skipping meals. since I’ve been home for the holidays I’ve felt even worse. the only thing I find myself thinking about is how much I want to lose weight and how easy it would be to not eat for most of the day and go for long runs and gym sessions. I believe I was getting better at school so it’s very disheartening that my progress seems to have disappeared as soon as I got home. I’m really at a loss about what I’m supposed to do. I really am not happy with how my body looks for the most part. Should I try to eat better and exercise more to fix my change in body composition or should I try to accept myself for what I look like?

2071,ekb6wy,Request: How do I stop my ED?,"(F22) All my life I’ve been a little heavy. Not fat but chunkier than everyone I knew. My weight really increased when I went to college. A year and a half later I dropped out and moved home. I told myself that I could only move back home if I lost weight. I didn’t want to move home and get fatter. I lost all the weight I had gained and then some pretty quickly (about 6-8mos). I lost the weight by not really eating. I would sleep until mid afternoon, work later until 11, have a small dinner, then go to bed. I knew that it was bad I was doing it that way so I got a gym membership and started eating normal and healthy. That lasted about 8ish months and I stopped going to the gym.

Until I realised something today: I’m not doing it since I want to recover. Well, actually I think I’ve known that all along, but what I really realised was that I was only able to accept eating like normal because in just over a year I’ll be going to university, where I can eat as little as I like and lose as much weight as possible without my family knowing or interfering.

Basically, I was only accepting recovery since I was planning to throw it away and go back to my disorder. Now that I’ve realised that, it’s much harder to keep eating than it was before, I haven’t had anything to eat yet today even, and I’m struggling with a lot more “pro-ED” thoughts. It’s like my mind is trying to convince me I’m doing the wrong thing by eating and I should go back to starving.

It feels like there’s no reason to stop when I’m just going to go back to it, but I can’t miss a chance like when I’m at university. I’ll never get another one like it and if I’m restrictive enough I could lose enough to be happy with my appearance.

So am I still doing the right thing by trying to eat? And if I am... how do I stop myself relapsing into it when I go to university?

Everything’s confusing as hell too. I have my therapist telling me I have a problem and need help. Then I have my aunt telling me my problem isn’t that bad and I’ll be fine. My moms also whispering in my ear telling me I’m not eating enough and that I’m going to get sick and have to be hospitalized. And of course there’s my bitch of a nana telling me I’m fat and there’s no way I have an eating disorder. What the fuck am i supposed to believe when everyone’s telling me different shit? 

It’s just tiring honestly. I was doing better for awhile, at least I thought I was but according to my mom I still wasn’t eating enough. At least I wasn’t counting calories though. Now I guess I relapsed (even though it’s not a relapse since I never got better to begin with) and I’ve been making up diet plans and exercising for hours on end.

They also sometimes randomly bring it up in conversations, and in both scenarios it makes me really uncomfortable, especially when people compare themselves to me. Also, whenever any of my close friends make fun of their own bodies and I try to tell them that they’re beautiful, they again compare themselves to me.

How can I help them get back on track?,"My partner struggled with various patterns of disordered eating (mostly restricted eating and binging/purging) for years before I met them. They've been recovering for I believe about two years, but have started to relapse this week.

They told me that they're beginning to miss how underweight they were and it scares them. They also said that, it feels like life is going too well for them right now (which, between us, isn't true, they have a ton on their plate), and they're scared something will fuck it up, so they're fucking it up themself in a way they can ""control"".

2081,ej9f6k,Request: how do I avoid being triggered by other people’s weight loss?,"I’m currently in college right now, in an environment where everyone has a fear of “freshmen 15”, so everyone is extremely conscious about their weight. A couple of my friends also just lost a ton of weight. They worked hard for that, going to the gym a lot and eating healthy (to my knowledge they don’t deal with eating disorders themselves), and now they’re a lot thinner. They also like to talk about their weight loss journeys a lot because they’re proud of themselves, but I find it so hard to be supportive because of my own issues. I’ve dealt with bulimia for a long time, and though it’s a lot better now, I get trigged by seeing how much weight they lost or hearing them talk about it. These are still my friends, so I want to be happy for them, but it mentally and physically hurts me to do so. So I guess I want advice for how to deal with that (without actually telling them about my ED-I have a hard time opening up to people about that).

2082,ej9enl,Request: F/18 Struggling with eating,"I’ve struggled with being a ‘picky eater my whole life’ my diet consists of the most basic foods, none of which are really nutritious because I can’t seem to stomach the thought of more complex meals. I get too scared before it even comes to trying new foods so I don’t bother, instead of having meals I tend to snack A LOT. 

I hate eating around people too, it makes me extremely anxious knowing that people might judge how/what i eat, my family are extremely negative when it comes to my eating often commenting on what i eat and if i don’t finish my meal (which I often don’t) which has lead to me sneaking around when I eat (eg. Eating away from others, hiding when I haven’t finished a meal to the point where I will bury the remains in the bin so nobody finds out or refusing to have meals all together with the excuse im not hungry)  

As you can imagine this makes eating out extremely hard and nerve-wracking, especially going to places I’ve never eaten at before or with new people.

I am extremely terrified of gaining the fat back I worked so hard to lose and after a binge I would feel like restricting my eating the next day, which would cause me to binge again later. I just want to find a happy medium where I don't constantly think about how many calories are in food and stop eating so much at once even after I am already full.

2085,ej52sw,Request: CONSIDERING treatment.,"Hey all. 

I'm f/27, and I recently have come to terms with having a full blown ED. My behaviors were pointed out to me by my therapist, who says if I keep up on the road I'm on, I'm going to have to do inpatient. I've been told I need to talk to my psych asap, but I'm BP2 and am terrified she'll change my meds. I'm functioning perfectly in all other aspects of my life (I'm a manager at a tech company and play in a touring band--I feel great, pretty stressed a lot, but great a lot of the time.) and am scared of her changing my meds, because what I'm on is keeping away the mania and the depression. I haven't decided if I want to seek treatment yet, I don't feel that I'm sick enough and bounce back and forth, but just cause I'm considering it right now at this moment, I've got a few questions: 

1. How do I talk to my psych about this and make it clear that I do not want a change in meds? (I really like my psych and have an irrational thought that she'll stop seeing me if I say I don't want to change them.) 

2. Let's say I might need more than therapy (which isn't really working even though my therapist is great, because no matter how much progress I make in the session, I still fall back into the behaviors), what other options do I have? I spend about 20% of the time wanting to get better, but honestly, I really don't want to most of the time and don't feel like it's bad enough.  

3. There's a place nearby that offers intensive outpatient. Does anyone feel they could share the costs of their own treatment? I have insurance through my employer.

4. Another reason: I love my job and I know they'd be understanding, but the thought of taking a lot of time off for this is just really scary for me--like they'll pass me up for promotion opportunities because I'll be seen as not being able to handle it. My boss is wonderful and kind, but I worry that this sort of thing will raise questions with others.

2086,ej5274,Request: I think I’m developing an eating disorder..? I could use some advice,"Here is the post.

TL;DR: I’m allergic to everything from most food, to (all forms of) weed, and even heavy breathing that comes from exercise causes anaphylaxis for me. How do I motivate myself to eat when I don’t have a way I can burn off fat while making the limited food I can have/act of eating food actually be enjoyable?

Sorry about formatting, I’m on my phone. Ok, so. Here’s the deal.

I have three auto immune disorders that cause me to be allergic to most food. This includes:

- dairy

- egg

- most nuts

- most seeds

- gluten

- raw veggies (but cooked are ok. There are some I can’t have either way though.)

- most fruits (berries seem to be ok.)

- all seafood, including seaweed

- balsamic and red wine vinegar 

- alcohol

- weed (so I can’t just smoke/eat it to give myself the munchies :/)

That’s everything I know I can’t eat off of the top of my head. I can have soy, by some miracle.

So I end up eating a lot of the same thing. I’ve cooked a lot of similar things. I’ve looked into cooking things from other cultures. But food’s expensive. It all tastes the same to me because I’m so limited.

And on top of that, I’m anaphylactic to working out. Like literally, last time I used a treadmill in a dr’s office they had to epi pen me. So if I gain weight, I have no way of working the fat off, I’m just stuck with it.

So for me, not eating is really a small price to pay for being thin since I’m stuck with the same foods I’ve been tired of for years.

But I came home from a dr appt the other day with constant shakiness and low blood pressure and realized I only ate one thing in a two day time period and I almost fainted.

I’m at the end of my rope, here. How do you motivate yourself to eat?",1578002380,1/2/2020 15:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ej5274/request_i_think_im_developing_an_eating_disorder/,6

I binge a lot, mostly at night. I feel bad for eating throughout the day. I don't feel full enough when I eat my sandwich etc during my lunch (yes I'm british). Dinner doesn't fill me up either, but it doesn't bother me as much. I just cannot sleep properly before crunching away at something or getting this weird sugar rush??

I was considering 'bulimia', wasn't sure how dangerous it is but I do know it's supposed to be really bad for you, unsure how. I just wanted to puke up, because lately having food in my stomach doesn't feel as good, as opposed to actually crunching my food, and the types and volume of food I eat just makes me feel uneasy. (I think the necessity to crunch could be due to stress coming through to my jaw, and crunching helps this)

2089,eiwsz2,Request: How to talk with someone about my sister," 

For the past six months, my fifteen year old sister has experienced a few minor physical ailments including feeling cold all the time and getting pins and needles in her hands and feet for prolonged periods. She's seen a paedetrician a number of times about this and they've been unable to identify any underlying medical issues but I think I've recently discovered the root cause. Within the same time frame of her experiencing these symptoms, she's lost a substantial amount of weight and is visably smaller. I've also found out that she has a messed up relationship with food. I'd like to make it possible for her to access help but I'm seventeen so I'm not really in a position to arrange help for her myself.

My relationship with my parents isn't great and I'd feel really uncomfortable talking to them about this. Instead, my plan is to talk to my sister's favourite teacher at school when we return after the Christmas break. I hope that the teacher can then inform my parents and liase with the school's safeguarding team to arrange councilling etc.

This is complicated somewhat by the fact that I found out about my sister's attitude towards food through an enormous invasion of privacy: I know the password to her phone and when I realised how much weight she was losing I went through it. I read emails she has sent to Samaritans (for those who don't know, Samaritans is a charity who offer free and confidential advice over the phone and by text and email) about her feelings about food, screenshotted them and sent the screenshots to myself. I believe that if my sister finds out about this, it will irreparably damage our relationship.

Therefore, I was wondering if anybody has any ideas about how I can deal with this without my sister finding out about my invasion of her privacy. If you've been in my sister's position and a family member found out about your illness, was there anything you wish they'd done differently when broaching the issue?

but anyway last april i was hospitalized for like 2 months for anorexia and bulimia and i got an ng tube like 8 times (bc they didnt want to leave it in bc it was damaging but it was more damaging to have it in and out a bunch of times) and then they discharged me.. i knew i wasnt ready and that i was just going to go back to my old habits but i didnt want to stay longer so i kept my mouth shut and pretended i was ready. things were ok ish at first i mean there was still the occasional purging and skipping meals but it wasnt that bad.. then came september.. things started getting pretty bad.. i went on a trip with my friend and her family to new york so we were eating a lot of junk food and stuff and i couldnt do anything about it.. so i decided that i would make a deal with myself.. the deal was that i could eat what i wanted and when i got back home i would just lose a lot of weight.. i kept that promise and started going with no food until dinner and even then i would only eat what i was served.. then i started going full days at a time.. then came october.. i was still eating as little as i could get away with and for some reason i made it so that every wednesday i wouldnt eat anything.. that went on for like the month of october i guess but there were some other days when i didnt eat all day either.. my mom stated catching on to it and kept threatening to bring me back to the hospital but not for an admission.. back when i discharged the doctors and my mom had decided that if i ever went a full day with no food my mom had to bring me to the hospital and get an ng tube.. so she was threatening to do that.. she didnt know i was going days without eating.. my mom said she made an appointment with my old therapist at the treatment place i went to and i was so scared.. i knew once i went i would be watched more carefully abt what i ate so i wanted to get as bad as i could before i went.. i didnt eat anything for four days.. when my appt came my therapist and mom decided that everything was fine and that i didnt need any help or anything.. so obviously i kept doing what i was doing because i was getting away with it.. my mom realized one day that i didnt eat anything so she took me to the hospital to get an ng tube.. they did blood tests and other tests to see if i was okay and the doctor decided that i dodnt need an ng tube after all so my mom was mad abt that but nothing happened. after that night the next day i wanted to get better.. so that went on basically a month and then things started going downhill again.. and thats where i am at now.. restricting huge amounts of food and my weight is dropping again but nobody has noticed yet..

2094,eiw1k9,Request: Post request: I need your guy's help to save my GF,"Hey guys, I really don't know what to do here and I need your guy's help. My gf has depression and AN – she's had AN for her whole life basically. She recalls being body-shamed at a very young age, and watching television shows with fat people eating (some contest show or something I think) and comparing her diet to theirs.

Anyways, AN is the much hardest beast to tackle. Last month, I helped convince her to get into the mental hospital and not to commit suicide. But the difference between her depression and her AN is that she acknowledges that the depression is a problem.

With her anorexia nervosa, she is actively denying help. She believes that the doctors just wanted her there for the money. When I provided the point that ""why do the doctors want the same thing as the ones who care about you?"", was unable to respond.

She's been in recovery for months, but she's planning on faking feeling better (she definitely doesn't), so she can get out of it completely. Then, on from there, she can lose weight without it being monitored. Her plan is to go off to college where no one can look after her, and then lose as much weight as possible (we're high school seniors). She's told me that there is no limit to how much she wants to lose – she will lose weight until she can't anymore. She keeps telling me she wants to see how long she can fast, and she told me she once went 132 hours and would have kept going but was forced to stop.

This is the problem: I'm the only one who can really help her. She's not closed off about her body issues to me and friends, but she's putting on the front of being fine to her mom. She can't get help without me doing anything. She's lying to her psychiatrist (or whatever they're called, I'm not too knowledgeable in this area sorry) and will die at this rate.

I want to tell her mom or psychiatrist (somehow) about this. However, I know that could hurt our relationship greatly. But also, she is saying that the help she's receiving is only helping with the weight – not her mentality. But recovery is definitely the move, and I understand how important it is. Because even if its not fixing her mind, its keeping her alive.

She's getting mad at me when I'm telling her I'm going to make sure she ends up alright. She actively wants to lose weight so badly that the end result has no effect on her (her depression meds also make her not worry about anything anyway).

A few questions:

1. Do I tell her psychiatrist / mom or try other methods (she is also suicidal and may feel betrayed by this)?

2. How can I make her feel OK when talking about this (I made the mistake of comparing her AN to me being anorexic formerly and the anxiety I developed from people judging me)?

3. Is it possible to convince her that help is the way?

I love her so much 💕 I care more about her health than our relationship and just want to see happy/healthy for her sake, not mine. Any help is greatly, greatly appreciated and I hope I didn't say anything triggering in this post

**POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING**

Hey everyone. I was wondering if there is a certain name for or if anyone has ever experienced this issue.


I grew up with poor parents and would always avoid telling my mom im hungry because i didnt want to upset her about there being no food in the house.

I have also been diagnosed with ADHD, BPD, generalized anxiety and depression. 

It effected me growing up and im now 19 trying to deal with this issue.

I dont necessarily avoid food to lose weight, but i do forget to eat for days sometimes because i developed not much interest in food.

On the other hand I'll binge on food usually at night on fast food, mainly McDonalds or just eating and eating anything i can find until i make myself sick. This doesn't happen every day but i just get random cravings sometimes.

I usually wont eat unless my aunt and uncle (i live with them now) make a really good meal (my uncle cooks really good and interesting foods) and have like 3 or 4 servings of it. I avoid asking my aunt if i can have some of her food when im running low on my groceries even tho she says she buys extra so i can have some as well.

I do feel horrible with myself after i binge, as well as when I realize i havent eaten in a while. 

I dont look at it as an eating disorder because i don't starve myself or force myself to throw up after. 

I have talked to psychologists about this and they wanted me to go to an eating disorder clinic but i just feel like im not part of the loop and have avoided going and lie saying im too busy.

My weight fluctuates on and off as well which has started to concern me but im still in denial. 

Looking for advice to see if there are similar experiences with this.


TLDR; I avoid eating for days due to having no interest in food (and childhood issues) but also binge eat until i feel sick some days. Can anyone relate?",1578998535,1/14/2020 4:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/eojo32/request_do_i_have_a_problem/,3

I only found out she has issues when her mum contacted me last year. That she has been skipping meals, going to the gym and counting her calorie intake for about 2-3 months.  And she’s been feeling very bloated and she missed her period for almost a year now. 

We hung out thrice in the span of three weeks of knowing and didn’t manage to find out why she changed. Her mum would constantly ask me to update her and let her know what she told us. So I was kinda in a lot of pressure because I felt like I had to know just to answer her mum. 

Less than a month of knowing, her mum decided to admit her to the hospital and wants us to persuade her to go. Bear in mind that my friend doesn’t know that we know her mum has been contacting us. 

That didn’t end up well because we ended up holding her down from hurting herself because she was threatening to kill herself.  She went overseas the next day despite us telling her parents to not let her go. 

Since then our friend group fell apart and I stopped all contact with her mum as she kept insisting on praying for her daughters health instead of getting the help she really needs. 

I saw her recently. And she looks skinnier and shorter? than we last saw her. We had a small talk but didn’t mention about what happened the last time we saw each other. 

I’m not sure what to do because I feel like I can’t afford to do anything else in case it might make her worse.

2102,eo7lfm,Request: Help on breaking an (apparently) endless binge cycle?,"Hi, so just a little back story: started struggling with anorexia in 2015 and back in 2018 I believe I started developing binge eating disordear given that I was eating anything and everything in basically no time and in 2019 it became a ""habit"", I'd no it nearly everyday. I got to break the habit for a period of time while being out of town and breaking the routine I guess so could you help me with ideas or advices on how to let go of it? I know it's not that simple but I'm just exhausted. It's exhausting.
Also I'm on a cycle of binging - purging - restricting. It goes on and on.

PS: cant see a psychologist/therapist. I am a teenager and I've tried talking to my parents about it once and they didnt take it seriously, said that ""it was all in my head and I was just lonely""",1578938047,1/13/2020 11:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/eo7lfm/request_help_on_breaking_an_apparently_endless/,9
2103,eo46af,Request: recover after restricting (16f),"Hello! I've been suffering with OSFED for about 4 years now and have decided to start recovering. I used to eat way below the recommended amount and wasn't even losing weight anymore. (My weight is within average range). 
Since I've been trying to eat more to meet the recommended amount for my height and weight, I've started to gain weight even though I wasn't underweight to start off with. 
Is this normal? And will the excess weight come off later when my body gets used to this or have I permanently damaged my metabolism?",1578922482,1/13/2020 7:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/eo46af/request_recover_after_restricting_16f/,5

I was like “oh great. more reasons to not eat a certain food group.”  I feel so weak, pathetic, and stupid. All I can think about is workout, eat, purge, restrict, eat, purge.

2106,enrty2,Request: I think my 13 year old brother has an eating disorder,"For as long as I can remember, my brother has been ‘fussy’ with his food. He will eat: chicken nuggets (only one brand), McDonald’s burger with NOTHING on it, cucumber and pasta. He will not eat sauce, if it touches his plate he will cry and scream and throw up. If his food touches he will not eat it. If it’s a different brand of food he knows IMMEDIATELY. If the food isn’t cooked correctly, he will not eat it. He keeps taking paracetamol for headaches. He exercises for a minimum of 5-6 hours per day (scootering). He is obsessive and has OCD. he picks at his food when he eats it. He drinks only 2 drinks (diet lemonade or water) He will not try any food or drink, ever. 
What startled me most, is that I bought him some joggers for Christmas and he said he couldn’t wear them because he looked fat. He put on skinny jeans instead and won’t wear anything else. Also, I had a meal replacement shake the other day (tooth extraction), and he immediately asked what it was and if he could have some.... he NEVER tries anything. He was very interested in trying it. His head is also kind of large in shape and he has a really skinny body. He is nutrient deficient and hyper mobile. His nails have started to get these white lines and he has huge black bags under his eyes.

2107,enm8qn,Request: [M] Seeking advice on self image issues," 

Disclaimer; I have never been diagnosed with an eating disorder, do not claim to have one and don’t think I have one, but I do think people in this sub might have an understanding of what I’m dealing with and might have some tips. My understanding of eating disorder is limited, so excuse me if I come off as ignorant. 

I’m a guy, 21 years old and weight has always been a bit of a struggle for me. I was a bit of a chubby kid and would loathe people that I knew that weren’t. This would, for example, result in my asking a classmate what she ate after school to remain so skinny. I’d try to mimmick, but I’d never manage to keep up with it. 

So back to the present; I’ve been sort off diagnosed with body dysmorphia. I had 2 options where to go for therapy; one intended to give me therapy specifically directed to my body issues (body dysmorphia focused), the other wanted to include that along with my overall low self-confidence and I ended up choosing the latter. One of my biggest issue is my fat % (which is X if I’m correct). I’m utterly disgusted with it and pick ‘safe’ clothing only. Those clothes can’t be too tight because feeling pants that’s too tight around the stomach (for example) will make me feel so gross about myself that I can’t focus on anything else. I stretch my underwear over my deskchair and put on the baggiest clothing I own the moment I get home. Aside from that, I’ve noticed that my thin isn’t everyone elses thin. What I think is beautiful, they think is too thin or unhealthy. They’ll also tell me I’m skinny or average, while I think I have way too much fat on my body. Back in 2015 my weight was 1 kg away from being underweight due to depression (I wasn’t starving myself on purpose, I just wasn’t hungry) and when I see those pictures I want to look like that again so badly. But I’m really fucking bad with food and exercise. I eat around X at most a day when I attend college all day (which I low key consider too much). This is much  less than what a guy my age should eat; but I’m not losing weight even if I only eat healthy foods (much to my annoyance). I try to exercise, but I’m usually completely exhausted by the time I get home and often end up not doing it. During the last holiday, I went some days eating something small, drinking some energy drink and then have dinner. But I can’t go on just that if I want to function at school. I’m very bad at resisting temptations of nice foods that are being sold either. This is kinda why I’m certain I don’t have an eating disorder; I’m not exactly ‘restricting’ on days I’m really really hungry. But that doesn’t take away that I have a distorted image of myself, what skinny is and that I kinda have the mindset ‘the less calories a day, the better’ even though I can eat a whole lot of fries and snacks if I want to. I don’t feel good about it, but clearly also not bad enough to not eat it. Long story short; 

Does anyone have tips for feeling absolutely disgusted with yourself, distorted self-image, constant disappointment of giving in to temptation and not exercising? x)",1578827075,1/12/2020 5:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/enm8qn/request_m_seeking_advice_on_self_image_issues/,4

2112,enm7n5,Request: January is such a hard month and I'm over it,"Hello, all. I guess this is less about advice and more about solidarity.

I went through treatment for anorexia back in March '18. I am fully weight restored and have a great relationship with food and exercise now. I still struggle and the ED ""voice"" is still there, but I'm able to combat it and I have a fantastic and supportive husband who I can turn to if I need an additional push in the right direction.

However, January (last year as well) just makes me feel like a recovery failure. I work in the fitness industry, so it's definitely more prominent. I feel like I don't care about my health because I'm not giving up alcohol or sugar for the month or engaging in food or workout challenges like everyone else. The voices are louder and it's harder to live a balanced lifestyle. I am still doing what is best for ME and have not relapsed despite wanting to.

I also find myself judgmental almost to an elitist degree, which I hate. When I was in the throes of anorexia, I had a very elitist attitude. I have more willpower, I'm more disciplined, I'm the skinniest in the room, etc. I don't like this elitist feeling and I feel it crawling back in; it's just directed at a different set of circumstances: e.g. 'Why are you giving up alcohol for 30 days when you tell me you can't wait for that bottle of wine at the finish line? That sounds dumb.' 'Why not just live a happy, healthy, balanced life year round and then you won't have to do these silly challenges?'

I find myself angry at my friends for joining these challenges. You witnessed firsthand what I went through and you know what my thoughts are on total restriction. Why are you falling into these traps? And why, despite me asking you to not tell me about these challenges, do you continue to do so in ways that make it seem like you're fishing for compliments? I truly don't care that you haven't had wine for ten days or that you're ""fasting."" I don't want to just cut everyone out of my life for the month, but EVERYONE is on some challenge train and it's driving me mental.

I also get frustrated because (and this is not anyone's fault but my own), I turned down social interaction that was situated around food or alcohol for years; and it's so frustrating when I am finally at that point where I want to go out and grab dinner with friends and be social and no one wants to because they're doing some food challenge or have given up alcohol. Even if it's me just wanting to get coffee. ""I'm not drinking caffeine this month and I don't want to be around it because it's tempting."" I'm ALL for living a happy, healthy life. I think we should think about our health as a whole and if our blood work/labs point to issues, we should try to fix those issues. But it's so frustrating when you finally find a balance and everyone around you seems to be living in extremes. 

TLDR: I hate January. I hate what it does to people. I hate what it does to me. I'm ready for February.",1578826836,1/12/2020 5:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/enm7n5/request_january_is_such_a_hard_month_and_im_over/,1
2113,enm79r,Request: I think I’m better now. How do I tell if my ED is just tricking me again?,"I’ve been dealing with a lot of ED symptoms for months now. I’ve tried to recover before and failed. But recently... I’ve met someone, and fallen in love with them. And since we met my entire life has got so much better. All of my problems seem less bad. My depression is all but gone. My anxiety is calmer. Everything feels better.

I’ve even been eating properly. Like a normal person. For the first time in weeks and I feel so much better. To be honest, I feel like I’ve just recovered from my ED (if I even had one, which I’m starting to doubt.) and I don’t have to worry about it anymore. I can just keep eating and not having to worry about skipping meals. Then I don’t have to worry about my parents finding out about all the food I’m not eating.

Because in 2 years I go to university. And I’ll be living on my own. Then there’ll be no one to control me. No one to care. No one to make me eat. I can do whatever I want and finally lose enough weight to be happy with myself without ever having to worry about my family finding out, because by the time I come back after university I’ll have lost enough weight to be able to stop dieting.

But that’s why I’m worried. I don’t want to stop losing weight, or restricting my diet, or anything like that. I just want to wait 2 years because then I can be even more extreme. I have a very logical mind due to my autism and I think I’ve just realised that it’s smarter to wait 2 years as at the moment dieting is hard as I have to work around my family.

So that’s my question: Am I better? Or am I just letting myself fall into a trap? I felt like I’d recovered before, months ago, and my ED convinced me I was better then, but it turned out I really wasn’t.

...............................................................................................

I think I’m definitely worrying about nothing and should just accept being happy and better, but I’ve just typed this entire message out so I’m not going to delete it... although it’s doing exactly this that gave me the wrong idea that I might have an ED in the first place.",1578826759,1/12/2020 4:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/enm79r/request_i_think_im_better_now_how_do_i_tell_if_my/,8

I just found out that I can’t fit a workout class into my schedule tomorrow and felt panic. My parents want to get brunch at a really unhealthy restaurant tomorrow and I’m googling the menu at 1:30 am to try to figure out what I can eat. I’ve been weighing myself at least 10 times a day. I’m dreading when I go back to school and know I can’t fit consistent workouts into my schedule at all, especially if I take on both a job and an internship like I’m planning to. 

The things is, these thoughts are really on and off and they have been since high school. When I’m back at college, I have other things to worry about like classes and homework so I don’t feel nearly as much pressure. At school, my friends and I would eat together and eat the same things so I wouldn’t feel as bad. I just recently picked back up calorie counting at all over break. I think it’s the winter break boredom/loneliness. It’s like, I feel like I can only operate in extremes.

So my friend has an eating disorder. She recently confessed this to me over texting. I am completely and 100% utterly supportive of her.

There's just a problem, I have the same thing. I'm still in the recovery phase of my disorder and I never told her about it.

I was planning on telling her but the moment she confessed to me, I decided not to. I am the first person she has told about her disorder, and this is a huge milestone for her and I am not going to take that away from her. I don't want her to think that I'm just confessing to her or making it up because she has it. That's unfair to her and my problems shouldn't take away from her recovery.

I just don't know how to help her. What she's saying to me is triggering me. Badly. I'm starting to feel the same way I did when I was in the thick of my disorder. It's so frustrating because I want to help her. I can't just abandon her. I won't. She trusts me and I love her with all of my heart.

2123,em7txe,Request: Being in college without support led to eating disorder,"Being in college without support ain’t shit Summary of how I realized: I think my financial situation is causing me to develop an eating disorder. At first I thought i was just  budgeting by skipping meals but then i started to tell myself it’s better this way because now i don’t have to worry about becoming overweight, jokingly. About year ago this time, i started seeing a psychologist for my depression and I would take an assessment twice a week. There were questions about eating and body image that i didn’t answer truthfully because I didn’t believe i had an issue with how i looked. After talking with her for months she recommended i meet with a psychiatrist for my depression but also started asking me about my eating habits. I could tell she started to hint at me possibly having an eating disorder and this made me stop going to see her in the end because I didn’t agree with what she was saying. This past fall semester after a stressful summer where i worked non stop, my friends started to notice a change in my weight. I still felt the same but i noticed my clothes fitting more loosely. Then my friends started to make jokes about me being “fatphobic” due to some comments they’ve heard me make. If they would compliment me on my weight, I’d say “no I’m fat “or “I’m so fat“. I just thought this was me awkwardly responding because I don’t know how to receive compliments. Then over some time I’d notice my friends would routinely ask me if I ate that day or if I go over their house and they’d ask me if i wanted something to eat. I rarely feel hungry so I’d always answer truthfully saying no and no thank you. It was only recently I weighed myself and saw that i lost a lot of weight from not eating alone. Of course to me I look the same but seeing that on the scale forced me to reevaluate. But still even after realizing this, I can’t bring myself to eat, I sometimes go days without eating and it brings me to tears knowing that I’m hurting my body like this. I feel that i dig myself in a hole that i can’t get out of because I’m so used to ignoring my body.

 I just wish i could see what others see. I want to make myself healthier but I just can’t force myself to eat.

2126,em7swd,Request: How to deal with coworkers who gossip about each other's weight?,"I recently started a new job that is an amazing opportunity for me. I'm making better money than I ever have before, and I genuinely love what I do. The problem I'm having is with the work culture.

By the end of my first week it became clear that the people I work with are not only very gossipy, but particularly so about things such as food and weight. By day three I had to listen to an extensive, 4-way conversation in the cubicles next to me about a girl we work with, what she eats, how much she probably weighs, how tall she is, how she looks, etc. Yesterday, I had to get up and go to the bathroom and cry because my entire department was sitting around talking about how much so-and-so should lose, and what weight they think they look best at. I keep my head down and don't participate in any gossip, not just because I don't want to make waves/enemies but because I really don't believe in talking about people behind their backs.

I'm currently pretty deep into a relapse and struggling to get out, but one of my biggest fears is the conversations that I know will start happening about me at work. Unfortunately, I confided in my manager that I had an eating disorder when I started to struggle to remain standing during the day, only to later learn that she is not to be trusted with personal information when I overheard her gossip about another girl's mental health medications. This means that if I try to go to HR about the problem, it will become immediately apparent that I'm the one who spoke up, and I seriously doubt that no grudges would be held against me.

I need to get better, but I also need to keep this job, and I have no idea how I'm ever going to feel comfortable in my recovery body while I'm there. Has anyone ever dealt with this kind of toxic work environment? What can I do to minimize the damage and be okay with gaining weight when I know for a fact that it will be a topic of conversation amongst my coworkers?",1578565368,1/9/2020 4:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/em7swd/request_how_to_deal_with_coworkers_who_gossip/,11
2127,em7sjg,"Request: I used to be obese and now trying to gain weight, feel ashamed when I eat","I probably don't have an actual eating disorder so I'm sorry for posting here but I think i may have some food and body issues so I hope it's okay.

I am male, i lost a lot of weight, from obese to technically underweight bmi, but I was quite fit and healthy and ran long distances. 

I started gaining after 5 months of maintaining being underweight because I was suffering from extreme tiredness due to my weight and exercise levels. I was also irritable and had brain fog. I want to be more muscular, but still have low body fat. 

I have only gained a small amount on the scale, but I am noticing lots of fat appearing and I hate it. I wanted to gain without gaining any fat, I knew a small amount was inevitable but I look really bad. It's gone back into the loose skin and I just look so much fatter than I am. 

While I was losing weight I read and watched a lot of fasting stuff and got in my head that if I was over 10% body fat I didn't need to eat (because the body fat is technically food) so I ended up fasting for long periods of time and then feeling ashamed when i ate.

Now that I'm bulking I'm sure I'm over 10% and it gives me anxiety, I know it's stupid but I'm terrified of getting fat again. I really want to lower my calories, every time I'm eating something my brain is like ""why are you eating this, you don't need it"" . Lol

Whenever I eat at this weight I feel like I'm so close to being my old fat self again, just eating because there is food around not because I actually need it. I want to be as far away from that as possible.

Do i even need food at this weight?? I honestly don't even know what to think anymore",1578565292,1/9/2020 4:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/em7sjg/request_i_used_to_be_obese_and_now_trying_to_gain/,1

2130,em7sd8,Request: New post about toxic parents and EDs,".

Now, I know there are many great and supportive parents out there, but I can't help getting mad when I read about parents fueling EDs and disordered eating patterns (my parents were like that with severe diets, miracle pills, diuretics and all that jazz, went NC almost 4 years ago).

Some doctors say it's not their fault if their children develop EDs because ""They don't know any better"". Like, for real? Some terrible parents teach us that our worth depends on a stupid number and encourage strict DIY diets and want us to hurry up and lose (in my case) an unrealistic amount of weight by a specific date, and call us living failures if we can't make it. And what about exercising? For example, they would scold me if I didn't do that throughout the morning and early afternoon, no matter how I felt or if I had severe period cramps. And the shame of having to get undressed in front of my mother and her girl friends and face their nasty comments about my size.

Parents can be extremely toxic and fuel dangerous patterns. You know, the whole ""The road to hell is paved with (not so) good intentions"". So why do some doctors excuse them if these kinds of parents ignore common sense, use shame and guilt to ""help"" us and set us to fall to pieces?

I apologize for this topic, but it really, really makes my blood boil when it comes to parents fueling EDs ON PURPOSE. Now I agree, not every parent is like that and many do a 180 when they recognize their wrongdoings. But those who don't want to see the damage.. URGHHHHH.

2132,esky06,Request: I'm not sure what's going on with my eating habits lately,"Back when I (22F) was 17/18 I was starving myself. Not because of how I felt about my looks, but because of outside issues in my life that I could not control(hence why I am hesitant to say it was anorexia). My body was all I could control so I drank only coffee with eating nothing more than maybe a carrot stick if anything. I moved for college when I was 18 and slowly got better. I got back to my healthy weight when I was 20.

To give a further scope of past issues, I had some traumatic experiences with my at the time boyfriend, my mom unexpectedly decided to up and leave my dad, along with a few other small things that happened in a very short time frame. My relationship with my mom has been slowly repairing, after I had some counseling last semester. I now have a very loving boyfriend who supports me through everything life has thrown at us the last couple years. I'm in my last semester of college, and while yes it is stressful, it is nothing compared to some other semesters I have had. In september my bf and I decided to move back to my home state when I graduate and we could not be more excited about it.

December I started noticing I was not eating again. Simply was not hungry for long stretches of time, then when I was on the verge of passing out I'd choke something down. These last two weeks it has evolved into a day or two of not wanting to eat at all, then a day of utter and insatiable hunger, then back to a few days of not wanting to eat.

I have been wracking my brain trying to figure out if something has happened recently to cause me to want to be in control again, but as far as I know, everything is fine. My bf suggests I go back to counselling but I have no idea what to bring up, or give any faint explanation to why I am going through this again. I'm thinking of going to the doctor to get some blood work done, see if theres a hormonal imbalance.

2134,eskxbr,Request: Need Help,"So disclaimer I don't have a serious eating disorder and I haven't been medically diagnosed with one, but according to my therapist, I'm starting to exhibit signs of one. I'm emotionally eating to the point where I am uncomfortable and it makes me feel like shit and I start to feel suicidal. Then I am tempted the next day to just not eat for as long as I can. I do that by not leaving my bed all day so I don't get tempted, but then when I have to go out for a therapy appointment, I go on another binge and the cycle starts over. I am legitimately scared of eating. I grew up with a mom who was a health freak and was always labeling certain foods as good and bad. Also, she made it out that being fat is one of the worse things you can be. 
Right now I'm going through a pretty difficult time. Well for starters therapists think I have CPTSD and depression after going through repeated trauma at the age of 18. I'm now 22 and still struggling. I at one point was in a residential treatment center that worked on DBT skills. And during that time I learned some healthier coping skills like running, playing the guitar and getting a job to give me something to do (assistant preschool teacher) 
I've been doing really well this past year. I hiked the entire Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and that was a huge win for me after struggling for so long. I got to the end ready to break free from living with an emotionally unavailable mom who doesn't understand boundaries. I was ready to go back to my job at the preschool and move out. But I found out that my wrist injury from a year ago didn't fully heal so I would need surgery. The Dr. made it clear that I could not go running, hiking, play guitar, go back to work and pretty much everything that keeps me happy and stable. And because I have no ability to make an income I am forced to continue to live with my mom.  
So I've resolved to overeat to feel pleasure. I definitely had a problem with emotional eating before but not at this level. I lost quite a bit of weight on the PCT and ever since I've been obsessed about keeping my body at that same fitness level and skinniness. People have praised me for all the weight I lost during the hike and it makes things difficult for me. 
So recently a friend told me about this philosophy of intuitive eating and I started reading the book, and I'm hoping this will help me establish a healthier relationship with food. Do any of you have any advice on how to start healing from this?",1579738902,1/22/2020 18:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/eskxbr/request_need_help/,2
2135,eskx8y,Request: New doctor thinks I have Anorexia but I don't think I do,"I'm a 23 year old guy and my new doctor seems to think that I have anorexia but I don't think I do. I just don't think it fits, and to be honest I don't want that stigma attached to me. 

I'm 5'11 and quite underweight for my height. 
My previous doctor never mentioned anything about any kind of eating disorder. He just told me to eat more and didn't make a big deal out of my weight loss. I went to this new doctor because I was worried about hair loss and feeling tired and dizzy all the time. I'm aware my weight may have something to do with that but I thought it might be something else as well because I'm not that underweight and it started getting worse recently.

I admit I have issues with my body image, however I never intentionally starved myself to become underweight and I don't even want to be skinny, it just happened.

About a year ago I was obese, I started a diet and got very obsessed with it and ended up underweight. I am very happy with my weight loss and I look a lot better now, but I would like to be more muscular. I have been underweight for several months now and I'm used to it and afraid of eating more.

I am very careful and controlled with what I eat and I calorie count, however I do NOT starve myself. I eat a healthy vegan diet, just enough to maintain my weight. While I was losing the weight, I ate very little. I have no desire to become thinner now, but I am very afraid of gaining the weight back, which is why I became underweight and why I haven't made any genuine effort to start gaining again. 

The one thing that the doctor really latched on to was the fact that i take appetite suppressants, I only take them because I took them throughout my weight loss, and I know binging often follows restriction and I don't want to binge and gain all the weight back. 

Is this anorexia?",1579738892,1/22/2020 18:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/eskx8y/request_new_doctor_thinks_i_have_anorexia_but_i/,29
2136,eskx69,"Request: Told someone, didn't go as planned.","I first realized that I had an issue a few months into 9th grade. I actively avoided eating whenever possible, and lost weight fairly rapidly. A few months later, I was noticeably thinner. Having started underweight, I dipped into a zone that would be seriously dangerous if I was much older.

I spent a winter in a constantly cycling between biting cold and a deep, shivering numbness. I slept far too much. I made choices that wasted hours of my time, including actively pushing myself to reach insane step counts - 20,000 steps was my weekday minimum. One night, my heart rate slipped to 37 BPM.

I gradually crept back upwards over the following half year, regaining about half of the weight. Every night I cried myself to sleep. I was worried about osteoporosis, heart failure, suicide. I toyed with the idea of asking for help, but always chickened out. It was my light at the end of the tunnel, something I could aspire to. They could fix me.

In the meantime, I wrote melodramatic poetry, and made many drafts of my will.

One night, I actually did it. I emailed my brother. After a long and tense exchange, I sent him my masterpiece - a conglomeration of the pest poems. I also sent my list of grievances, including, of course, my ed.

He asked me two things. I wasn't really going to kill myself, right? And what did I mean about the snippet about him, and how I felt bad for not listening to him?

Then he shunted me off to Mom.

Therein lay the most surreal experience of my life.

She had me wait in the guest bedroom for fifteen minutes while she reviewed the relevant documents. (I left my computer with her for easy viewing.) I shivered, terrified, in the dimly lit room. My life was about to change.

We began a bizarre discussion. She quickly dismissed my ed concerns - she'd flirted with one herself when she was my age. We focused more on my problems with socialization, spending half an hour on her childhood woes. It quickly shifted to a rant - she claimed to be over it, and fine now. She clearly wasn't. The session ended with a bold declaration - this was going to be the year of … username ... !

That lasted a solid twenty four hours. Nobody ever even told Dad. We haven't mentioned eds since.

For the rest of the summer, I was diplomatically forced to drink smoothies and finish my plate. I checked off the ""eating disorder concerns"" box at the doctor - she erased the mark. My brother and I went in for some mental health thing. She said she'd come in and we could talk about my ed concerns. We didn't.

One month later, my brother and I had a pathetic fight over who got to shower first. He taunted me, ""Keep eating that pudding! Aren't you worried about being stupid and fat? Doesn't it make you feel sick?"". I haven't told him anything personal since.

He thinks we're pals.

We aren't.

Through brute force and incessant whining, I convinced Mom to let me see a therapist. In the house, we refer to her as a general ""appointment"". I haven't told the therapist about any of this. She thinks my biggest concerns are socialization and accepting my brother. I've never alluded to depression, eds, or self-harm, even when specifically asked.

I'm a pretty good liar.

I told myself I'd build some trust and then we could broach the subject, but I'm in too deep now. I'm far too scared. I can't have this happen again. And she remains my new light, dimmer, flickering, and likely a mirage.

I weigh fifteen pounds more than when I started. I constantly stuff my face with sugar - a massive percentage of my diet relies upon it. I casually try to stay under my calorie limits, but overeat anyway.

I don't feel comfortable claiming the title of an ed. I clearly don't have the willpower.

Sorry for the rant. I just needed to get it out of my system.

I have recognised my triggers and know other people’s diets can affect me so I try to zone out when this is happening. 

My boyfriend complains a lot about what he eats and how he feels bad for eating it which does trigger me quite badly. Specifically if he eats something like chocolate then will talk the whole night about how bad he feels for it and affect his gym progress. I have been upfront and told him that this does trigger me and while I feel like im trying to do well with recovery, this haunts me by making me feel like “well if he feels guilty about eating then I should feel a million times more guilty”. He has apologised for this and has said he will try to stop talking about this, but then will continue to talk about this. He even recognised this and will say “sorry if this has triggered you” but at the end of the day, saying sorry for this doesn’t get the thoughts out my head.

2142,esa6e4,Request: Help for girlfriend that is trying to lose weight while battling ED? Is it possible?,"
I am a man who has been dating a lovely woman who just recently opened up to me about her ED. For context she was about 100 lbs overweight and managed to lose about 40 lbs through what she initially told me was just diet and exercise, but recently broke down and told me about her ED, and how purging was the reason she lost weight. I'd like to just preface by saying I love her, and want to support her, but I am so inexperienced in this realm. I loved her when she was 100 lbs overweight, and I still love her now. 

The problem is that she feels like shes doomed to ever be an ""average weight"" (she wants to lose around 60 lbs - her own goal that she set for herself, not mine or anyone else's). The reason she feels this way is because her previous therapist has told her not to focus on losing weight, and she feels all other therapists she tries to go seek help with will say the same. But the tricky part is that her overweight status is making her binge/purge even worse. Is there in-between therapy? Is there a field of therapy that can help people learn to lose weight and develop healthy habits to do so, or is it mainly just ED recovery with no mention of weightloss? I feel so helpless as a S/O, and I don't know what to suggest to her. I read the sidebar and stickied post with the helpful links to posts, but didn't see anything about battling weightloss and ED at the same time. Her ED has gotten worse as she gains more weight, and I'm afraid that if she doesn't learn healthier coping/habits, that this ED will only continue to get worse. 

 I'm just a guy who wants to help this girl. I've learned a lot about ED, and especially learned how to talk to her without triggering shame/guilt, but as for encouraging her to seek help, I have no idea where to begin. I don't know what options are out there. She's convinced that any ED therapist she sees is going to just tell her to stay overweight, which will only make her ED worse. Again, if there's a more suitable subreddit to post to, please let me know.

Hearing from other people that I've lost weight is EXTREMELY triggering and I've started to notice old thought patterns coming back.

2145,erslfn,Request: Hi. R/eatingdisorders,"I’m afraid I’ve developed an ED.

Background; I’m bipolar 1. This is important.

My mom has suffered from anorexia. She almost died of cardiac arrest when she was 17, from anorexia. She was always up my ass about my weight, even when I’m underweight.

5 years ago I was on Zyprexa for bipolar. Gained 30 lbs. I didn’t love it but I didn’t mind it. I’m “naturally” very thin, and wouldn’t be considered overweight having gained the weight. When I went off I developed a condition called gastroparesis, where my stomach didn’t empty well, so I was always nauseous and sick. Lost a ton of weight.

In January, I was really underweight and not doing well mentally so my dr put me on Seroquel. I’ve gained almost as much as on Zyprexa. 

Problem is, I’ve been binging and restricting. I’ll admit it. I go all out for a few days, then stop eating almost entirely. My weight has been yo-yo-ing a lot. For a month it’ll be higher, then I’ll lose weight, in a cycle. I feel guilty and awful when I eat 3 meals. And my body disgusts me compared to when I was underweight.

I feel absolutely huge now. I know I’m not but I keep looking at my body in extreme disgust. My ass/legs (where I gain) look horrible.

I’m trying to just be healthy but I feel like I really have body dysmorphia.

I’m going to talk w my therapist about this tomorrow before it gets out of hand. I don’t know what to do. I already feel almost addicted to food/eating and the number on the scale.",1579601205,1/21/2020 4:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/erslfn/request_hi_reatingdisorders/,3

One of my (F17) closest friends (M17) was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa in middle school, before I met him. He mentioned this in passing a few months ago, but he heavily implied that he had fully recovered. I didn't think much of it at the time, especially given that he had gained quite a bit of weight since middle school (he's still extremely underweight, but has improved significantly). 

However, lately I've noticed that he has been severely restricting. I don't know if he's been doing this all along and I've just been oblivious or if he's been backsliding, but I've seen him go at least 8 hours with only a few bites to eat. I'm extremely concerned about both his physical and mental health, so I've been reading what I can in an attempt to understand his experiences and be a positive force in his recovery. [FYI: his parents and doctor are aware of this issue, but I'm not sure if he's receiving any treatment]

He recently initiated a discussion with me about his eating habits. He knows that he is substantially underweight and he wants to change that, but he also says that he feels full all of the time and that he doesn't really eat when stressed. The word ""anorexia"" was never mentioned, but it was the implicit context behind the discussion. I would like to bring it up again to discuss the disorder specifically and find out how he experiences it (as has been recommended in many of the articles I've read). Would it be appropriate to say something like ""I know that you've struggled with anorexia in the past and I've noticed that you haven't been eating very much lately. I don't know a lot about eating disorders, but I would like to learn more if you feel comfortable sharing""? I think the most natural time to bring this up would be the next time he's eating virtually nothing at lunch, but would it be better to bring it up when food isn't around?

Secondly, if he chooses not to discuss the matter with me immediately, when/how can I bring it up later? What is the appropriate amount of ""pressure,"" so to speak, to apply?

Thirdly, I imagine that this is especially difficult for him considering that society does not typically associate anorexia with heterosexual males. Is there anything I should be cognizant of in that regard? Anything I should or should not bring up, or that I should be prepared to discuss?

2159,ephmqp,Request: request. my girlfriend has an eating disorder and i have no idea how to help,"I'm going to sum up a woman's life and a 4 year relationship in a few paragraphs so bear with me here. There's a lot to tell so this will be long. 

We met at a party. Both heavy drug users, our relationship started with a pact to help each other quit. There were relapses along the way but as of this year we are 2 years sober.

She had a tough childhood. An absent father and a Mother with severe Schizophrenia resulted in her being sent to one foster care after another from very young until she was 18. As a Ward of the State, she was given money from the Government, free therapy, and some  other generous yet ultimately useless perks until she was 21 - then her benefits stopped and she was, once again, alone. Unable to afford all of the services herself, she was forced to stop seeing her therapist-the one person who was actually helping her-and move into a disgusting apartment just to afford the cost of living while working a minimum wage job***

She was severely bullied her whole life and has hundred of cuts all over her body, some of which the scars are so deep I'm surprised she didn't cut her leg or arm clean off. She has been clinically diagnosed with BPD. Her symptoms include but are not limited to severe depression, anxiety, self harm and dissociating . All of this plus at least one suicide attempt brought on or worsened by the powerful stimulants she was using caused her to be hospitalized on and off for 3 years, with her longest in-patient stay being 4 months. This all happened before she was 18***

Edit: most of the hospital visits including the 4 month inpatient was actually because of the eating disorder.

Somewhere during that time she was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa. I had no idea as her symptoms were not present for the first year of our relationship. We went out for dinner weekly, drank lots of beer, cooked greasy fat filled food. Then, all of the sudden, shes restricting to xxx to xxx calories a day and had lost xxlbs in 6 months by changing nothing but her calorie intake and using laxatives. 


She's finished DBT and has done in patient treatment at an eating disorder clinic but was discharged in week 19 of 20. This was a massive trigger for her. She relapsed immediately. She is now on the waiting list to get back in and we are requesting residency right away to help interrupt her symptoms but, because she was a healthy weight at her initial assessment she was diagnosed with Bulimia sub type binge purge. This only made matters worse as she felt she was no longer skinny enough for a diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa.

Before I continue I want to say that I do not pity her. She's the most courageous person I've ever met. If I had been through half the stuff she has I guarantee I wouldn't have made it past 18.

Fast forward to today. She limits herself to a very small number of calories each day. She went up xxlbs in treatment and is now back down xxlbs as of today. She will only eat 4 or 5 different foods (5 cal jello, 15 cal yogurt etc), binge purging junk food once or twice a day and using diuretics and laxatives weekly (daily??)

I feel useless. I've been to a few seminars and seen a free counselor who specializes in peer support for people with ED and she told me  ""all you can do is be there for her and show her you care, and support her while she fights her battle.

I have pretty severe chronic depression, so much so that two years ago I nearly ended my own life and had to stay in a mental hospital for a while.

I never had much in concern to healthy eating habits... Before my attempt, I had phases where I periodically wouldn't eat. After, I had phases where I would binge and then purge. But I always ended up back in the same position: using food to cope.

I find myself now almost binging whenever possible. At school during lunch I'll start to feel full, but then I still continue to eat despite this. At home I often find myself periodically walking into the kitchen and eating whatever I can, even if just a tiny bit of food. At work (I work in food) I always sneak little bits of food and eat a lot when I'm not working. When I'm feeling especially depressed, I often go down to my room to sulk and eat as sugary a substance as I can find to fill some type of void within my stomach.

I feel so uncomfortable in my body and I feel like I'm losing my way, I don't even know who I am at this point. When I sit down I can feel my stomach rolling on top of itself, and it makes me feel so uncomfortable and foreign. I feel like I have no control over myself and I hate feeling like a stranger in my body.

2164,evw5zw,Request: when is it wise to visit hospital for help?," 

I’ll make this short and sweet, my partner I live with has been suffering for a number of years with bulimia. I met her about six months ago and it has gone through a few phases of calming down and making progress to piping back up, however lately it is worse than usual. The past two weeks she has been binge and purging every single day, usually when I go to work for the evening and even some days when she has a shower. We openly discuss these as she has the full intention of being sick of this ordeal and wants it to end however no matter what we have tried it seems to be fruitless, that being said I believe it’ll help to form some new healthy habits eventually if we stick to our things of journals, meal plans and positive affirmations.

What I have to ask is how often does this have to occur before it is worthwhile to make a serious visit to the hospital and get emergency help through therapy. My girlfriend is 18 and here in NZ the mental health system is very slow and has wait lists of six months or more, however generally you can get into see a crisis team if it’s a serious issue. Is daily binge/purging bad enough to warrant this and how do you explain it to the hospital without seeming pedantic? I am learning as much as I can about this to support her however possible, and it’s equally important as we have our own place together, so any advice to give about things you have done to get yourself out of a bad cycle period is also welcome.

I am feeling completely overwhelmed with the number of options I have for recipes/meals that are nutritious, healthy, and I feel comfortable eating.

Half the time I don't even know what the hell I am craving or what I WANT to eat. All I know is that I am hungry. How do 'normal' people decide what they are going to eat when they are hungry? When 'normal' people are hungry do they crave a certain food and aim to eat that, or do they just eat what is readily available? I think I know the answer already but I am just so confused. 

Dinner time is always the worst, I have zero fucking clue if I should cook something or eat one of the healthy meals that my mom has already cooked. Not only that, when I do think about cooking then I start getting confused like - should I use ingredients we have readily available at home even though I might not necessarily want to, or should I go out and buy my own ingredients to make a meal I want?

Now I know what you are going to say 'Why don't you meal prep?' 
See, but I get incredibly confused with meal prepping too. With all of the options for recipes and meals I have such a hard time choosing what to eat.

2166,evlduc,Request: Is this normal or is this my ED?," 

I’m curious about this as my eating disorder has ebbed and flowed, grown with me and (I guess) never gone away. Where I used to starve and then purge any meals, I eat a relatively normal diet in public, often rushing home and bingeing behind closed doors, and purging now has returned but only occasionally.

I want to seek help as I hate my body. I mean. I feel FAT. (I know being overweight isn’t gross, and I’m not even overweight by a BMI standard) but in my mind and this my reality, I am fat and I am gross. I’d go to therapy but don’t feel thin enough to seek help. I think group might be triggering.

It’s all consuming to think about. And it’s dreadful.

I wonder though if this is something that the average woman (or individual regardless of gender) feels? How much of this is ED and how much is societally ingrained? I wonder if I’m fine, and destined to hate myself and have closet eating habits for my whole life.

Do non-ED people BP, or is this experience, combined with the obsessive thoughts about weight only occur in people with ED? Thoughts?",1580295288,1/29/2020 4:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/evlduc/request_is_this_normal_or_is_this_my_ed/,2

i’m 17 and male if this helps.

so i like never eat and never have any appetite, food makes me feel physically sick a lot of the time just seeing or smelling it and i’ve just never really had a great relationship with food i’d rather just eat the bare minimum for sustenance.

i think i’ve always maintained a healthy weight though, (i don’t weigh myself really ever). apart from the past year due to a dramatic weight gain (dramatic to me anyways and multiple people pointed it out also) because of medication i’ve always been called skinny and anorexic but i just never really understood why i thought i was a fine weight i never thought about it much. i don’t think it was even much of a weight gain on the meds i just had a little bit of a stomach on me but i felt like i looked in labour, luckily i think i’m starting to lose the weight again since i changed meds and have been eating less but yeah i just wondered if any of this indicates an eating disorder or not because i’m worried about my health, i never focus on weight when thinking about food i don’t care how many calories are in something or if something is fatty i mainly eat junk food anyways since i only really snack here and there unless i smoke weed and get my appetite back a little so i can eat a meal.",1580295151,1/29/2020 4:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/evld64/request_do_i_have_to_constantly_be_worried_about/,4
2168,evlc4c,Request: confused about whether I am eating as a normal (healthier) person or if I really have an obsession with food," 

I don't know how to describe what I am feeling right now. I am confused about whether I am eating as a normal (healthier) person or if I really have an obsession with food. I'm 15, my whole life until I was 14 years old I was slightly overweight (especially since my parents couldn't accept that I was fat, they were/are normal weight) At 14 yrs old, I started to lose weight by controlling my calories, and I lost 10 kg in a year, and reached a normal bmi. Since 2020 started, I have been so afraid of going back to where I was, that I can no longer think of anything other than excuses for not eating, or ""meal plans"" for example, eating certain food first, or planning when I'm going to be full. I've lost 6 kg in a month and I don't want to stop, I don't eat if I don't have to, but my parents will get mad if I don't eat in front of them so I just surrender lmao I don't like eating, but the fact that when I'm with them I eat makes me feel I'm not sick enough and that I'm faking it, because other people really have it worse than me.

Other thing, the reason I made this post was because recently I fainted (luckily they weren't home) because I was doing too much crunches, I also have this addiction with exercise but as I've said, I eat when I'm with my parents which is almost everyday, I only skip breakfast. Is this an eating disorder? No one really noticed anything else than I lost weight, only one friend of mine knows about this...

2170,evlap5,Request: What does full recovery look like?," 

What does full recovery look like? Is it real? I've suffered from body dysmorphia and eating disorders for as long as I can remember. I remember being 8 or 9 in gymnastics and comparing my thighs to the other girls on the team, and then skipping my snack and running extra laps. It's so sad for me to think about the years of childhood I lost due to being so consumed by body image and control and everything else that comes with EDs.

 I'm 24 now and I'd like to say I've recovered, however I don't know if that is being fully honest. Sure, I'm no longer purging through various methods, but I'm still stuck in this cycle of binging and over-restricting. I have long periods where I am in control--I feel in control--and I can eat healthily and take signals from my body and respect it and accept my body for what it is. There are days where I speak kindly to myself, I'm full of self-compassion, and I'm aware of the unrealistic expectations that are placed on me and others. I have days where my fiance tells me I'm beautiful and I half believe him...but then there are days where he tells me I'm beautiful and I want to shrink away and disappear because I can't stand to be lied to...and even more I can't stand myself or the thought of him looking at me and seeing all my flaws. There are days where I engage in such destructive behaviors (I won't list to avoid triggering anyone) and such ugly self-talk that I just want to scream. Sometimes I do. Sometimes I just drive down the highway and scream and bang my fist on the steering wheel because I'm so filled with self hatred that it has to come out some way or I might actually explode.

 I disguise these episodes, relapses, by citing the health benefits of fasting, or blaming my crazy schedule for not allowing me time to eat, or not feeling well, or my medication making me lose my appetite, or whatever but the truth is I'm doing it all to myself. That being said...I haven't self harmed in years. Most days are good days. I've pretty much identified my triggers and I know about healthy coping. I'm very sad today, though, because I feel I've reached a conclusion that I've been ignoring for so many years. I've almost completed my master's degree in clinical mental health counseling--I'm finishing up internship this semester. I've always set a goal of working with individuals who suffer from EDs because I wanted to be the helping hand and support and safe place that I never had. I've fallen in love with the mental health field and I feel like a big fat hypocrite. How can I expect to work with clients and help them overcome something that I can't overcome myself? How am I supposed to take care of myself when I am surrounded by triggers that I cannot yet safely cope with? How can I be a hope monger when I have no hope myself? The first rule of therapy is to have faith in the process...it's get's better before it get's worse...and I truly believe that in so many ways. But I don't believe it for myself and I feel like a phony handing out phony hope and phony smiles and phony treatment and phony safety. Does it ever stop? Like truly and honestly...go the fuck away?",1580294631,1/29/2020 4:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/evlap5/request_what_does_full_recovery_look_like/,6
2171,evl9lf,Request: Do I have an eating disorder?," 

I’m a female of a healthy weight and I never have issues of negative thoughts while eating. In fact, I really love food and trying new things etc. Eating has always been a reward to me, but in order to push myself mentally I usually allow myself to eat after I have completed a task up to my standards as a reward of sorts. Unfortunately it can become more negative to the point where I will not allow myself to eat until I finish all of my tasks in my agenda. If I’m in a really bad head space I won’t allow myself to eat at all as a punishment for not doing well enough.

As for body image, I always thought I was chubby in middle school and my sister recently told me that I was never chubby at all growing up. When I look at my body from my perspective now I look fuller than I do when I see myself in a picture or a reflection from fat away. Perhaps I focus too much on individual parts of my body rather than my entire body as a whole. Like I am aware that I’m skinny, but I don’t think I’m THAT skinny.

And there are days when I eat really well and I feel good, not a hint of regret or disgust. If I eat too much and get bloated I feel gross, but I’m pretty sure everyone does when they eat too much.

Is it actually an eating disorder, or is it like a weird way of self harm? Or is that the same thing? Regardless, I know I need to seek help due to my infrequent suicidal thoughts, but I guess I’m just trying to seek validation and come to a conclusion about what’s going on.",1580294421,1/29/2020 4:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/evl9lf/request_do_i_have_an_eating_disorder/,2

I’ve gotten much better (and much worse, and much better again) but I’ve come to a sad realization that I’ve never been able to say that I felt normal. 

Just some background: eating problems started around 13, diagnosed, gone through many programs, therapists etc. I went from anorexia to bulimia and now I feel like I’m constantly in between the two. 

Somehow I feel like I’m slowly making mental progress, while at the same time falling back into restriction habits? It’s like some days my ED is off and others it’s on. I log my food intake. Some days I check it because it’s a compulsion, other days I check it because I’m really worried that I’m starving myself again and need to see if the numbers are actually healthy. 

Why is this? Is this normal for just a really, really slow recovery? Everyone I was in group therapy or away programs with many years ago, have pretty much figured it out. Not sure why mine won’t go away like theirs.

We caught up 1 on 1 over the weekend and reconnected and talked. But a lot of the things she talked about have me really worried. Both her parents (separated) comment on her weight, and on what she eats (but offer no alternative), her dad calls her the nickname ""Fatty"" (he's starting to stop because she complained). On top of that, she doesn't have a lot of control of her life. Always moving between houses (mum's, her dad's, her grandparents) because of separated parents, and also that mum often goes away on short &amp; long holidays so Sister is kind dropped on someone else's door. On top of that, my sister has some friends who threaten self-harm and suicide to emotionally manipulate her.

She tried self-harming because she's experiencing some kind of depression. She feels like a burden. She struggled to explain and I didn't want to push her too much when we were talking. But when mum found out she called her ""weak"" and that people who self harm are just weak, and vaguely threatened she would have hit her if she wasn't driving at the time (she was a physical disciplinarian). Mum was the same with me when my doctor prescribed me an antidepressant/anxiety medication (get over it, other people have it worse, toughen up, etc). 

I never had particular issues with disordered eating, my issues were anxiety based and I don't have a good understanding of ED, but I can see her struggling and I'm worried. She definitely thinks she's fat, even though she's just normal. Mum will walk into my sisters room and check herself out in the mirror there (stomach and legs etc) even though mum has always been fit/thin. My sister said it just makes her feel worse.

If anyone has any helpful advice, please share. I don't think she has an ED now, but I just want to be preventative rather than reactive. At the moment, I'm just going to focus on giving her a safe space to be honest and open with me.

Since we met a few months back, she has been very open about having an ED for the last 2-3 years. She has been in treatment before about a year or so ago. In the time frame after leaving treatment until we started dating, she has been up and down in weight and struggling with depression. 

From what I I’ve been told about her ED, it was mostly in the form of restriction. From the time we met until now she has started eating dinner with me every night and being more comfortable discussing food. However with the more we make dinner a regular thing, I  notice  signs of her purging as we continue meals (frequent trips to the bathroom right after a meal, locking the door behind her, running the faucet, brushing her teeth before returning. It appears her condition has gone from restriction to binging and purging. She’s gaining some weight, which is a good sign that the nightly meals are becoming helpful in recovery, but I’m still concerned for her with this development of her ED.

Last year I went to the doctor and found out I had gained 20 pounds. I was floored. I’d been skinny and practically underweight my entire life. I used to be one of those girls who could eat whatever they wanted and not gain any weight. But all that changed last year. I started dieting and going to the gym, and I lost about 13 pounds. While I was happy to have lost the weight, I’m terrified of gaining it back.

I haven’t weighed myself in over a month because I’m scared the number is going to go up. I had a doctors appointment then and the only reason I weighed myself was to prepare myself in case I put on a few pounds. This was also around the holidays when my mom and I were baking and my job was constantly bringing in cookies and cakes and stuff I couldn’t resist. 

My mom thinks I’ve become a little obsessive with my food and calorie intake. Maybe I have been. I always check calories and other nutritional facts before I eat. Here’s the part where I’m not sure if I have an issue though. It’s not like I refuse to eat unhealthy food. My boyfriend loves pizza and I’ll eat it if it’s presented to me. My mom made brownies recently and I’ll eat them. But I usually feel guilty afterwards and feel the need to “detox” and eat super healthy for the rest of the week after I cheat. I also make it a point to do a ton of cardio at the gym to burn everything off. When I go out to eat, I like to walk around afterwards to try to burn off what I just ate.

2189,etsla5,"Request: Title: nausea, extreme hunger, chills....am I okay?","Hello! After going back and forth for 5 years with my eating disorder I'm seeking professional help. I've been trying to self-recover but I don't think I'm getting enough calories. 

Yesterday I thought I ate enough but I couldn't even sleep last night because I was hungry. I got up at 2am to try to eat  something but everything was so unappetizing to me so I was basically forcing food down. This morning was no different when I was eating breakfast everything on my plate didn't taste appetizing except the fruit I had. Even the thought of food/looking at it makes me feel nauseous which scares me because I'm trying to recover and feel normal.

This morning I felt nauseous after eating. The thought of food made me feel sick. All I want to eat is fruit. I had to force down the bread from my sandwich. Dreading lunch where I know I'll have to eat another sandwich and feel sick eating it. Lunch was similar in that I was forcing down food because I knew I needed calories, but I felt nauseous at the thought of food. The only thing I could take down is fruit and sone raw veggies like baby carrots. At this point, my nausea from everything slowing shifting into my ""extreme hunger"" phase. This wasn't the first time I experienced extreme hunger, and both times although I was somewhat starving, I wasn't open to eating all types of food and some foods made me nauseous/sick even though I was hungry.

 told my parents and they got me orange chicken and an ensure protein shake. While I was waiting for the food from the store, I made myself a fruit protein smoothie so I could have something. I drank half before I got light headed ans got chills and needed to be under 2 comforters. While in bed, the orange chicken was brought to me and I tried to eat it. After a bite I couldn't keep it down and felt like I was going to throw up.

2190,etsl1f,Request: Triggers at Jobs," 

I feel like this is a common issue for ED sufferers, and even for those in recovery. I have always been stressed about eating at my jobs. I'm not even 100% sure why, since I have been able to go out to eat and feel just fine for a while now. Currently I am dealing with more triggers than I have since high school, and they are making me feel like I am going backwards in my journey.

I used to have a job where I was on my feet all day, usually lifting things and pulling skids. This job gave me permission to eat (after a long struggle to get there - but still, i had finally found my balance). This October I got a promotion to a desk job. I was so terrified that the change in my physical activity (especially because I never worked out outside of my job) would lead to weight gain that I began restricting again. I've watched my decisions get more and more disordered surrounding my lunch/snacks at this new job, and it is extremely frustrating to me because before the switch in jobs, I was managing my ED better than I had been in about seven years.

Today a large group of people were loading the elevator to go up to our floor. There wasn't enough room for everyone so initially me and a few other girls hung back. Then the group in the elevator started waving us in, saying there was still room. The two girls ahead of me went ahead, so I felt pressured to join as well, even though I hate crowded elevators. Well, the moment I stepped into the elevator the buzzing noise went off indicating that I tripped the maximum weight alarm. I had to literally turn around and hang my head in shame while everyone went ""awwww man.""

I'm not a heavy person, in fact I fight myself every day on whether I need to lose or gain weight (hello body dysmorphia, I hate you). But that whole incident has me feeling worse than I have in a long time.

Mostly I felt like I needed to vent, but I also wanted to know if anyone else has experienced similar struggles - and if you have, well now you know you are not alone!",1579968553,1/25/2020 10:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/etsl1f/request_triggers_at_jobs/,3

During my teenage years I suffered from anorexia. I have been in recovery since I was 20. I then developed a compulsive eating disorder, which I am also in recovery from. 
In addition to the above, I have hypothyroidism which means I have to be quite mindful of what I put in my body owing to the fact that my metabolism is very weak. 
Recently I have accepted the fact that for my own wellbeing I need to lose some intravisceral fat. I'm absolutely determined to lose the fat in a healthy, sustainable and finite way, because I can't imagine anything worse than relapsing. To avoid having to confront figuring out some kind of diet (which I'm worried would risk me relapsing), I've been doing regular High Intensity Interval Training. However, I am very aware of the fact that the primary solution for fat reduction is careful eating. So I've been looking everywhere for some kind of structured ""diet""(ish thing) that would be sustainable and not send me back to a dark place. However, honest to god everything I see is calorie restriction (which I fully understand is how fat loss works) which is really difficult for me to handle. As such I was hoping someone (anyone) on this subreddit might have been through something similar and might be able to share their experience or offer advice?

i’ve been suffering from a binge eating disorder for nearly 2 years and it made me gain a shit ton of weight within a short period of time... 
Even though i’m not fat i’m just chubby but at the same time i hate it as afterall i gained a shit ton of weight in several months. 
People always tell me that i look like i’ve gained weight or gotten fatter and that made me scared of meeting old friends and family. 
I’ve literally tried everything there is possible but nothing is working and i think i fucked my body’s metabolism up. I’ve tried over 16 types of diet products/pills, keto diet, intermittent fasting, water fasting, low sugar diet, calorie restricting, meal planning and such. 
I usually do not have the habit of eating breakfast and sometimes lunch BUT i’ve tried eating 3 proper meals a day and all it made me do is binge 3 times a day instead and making it a whole lot worse. 
I’m able to control when i’m outside but i lose complete control when i’m at home and my house is filled with a shit ton of snacks... i live with my family and honestly, they don’t give a fuck so they just keep on buying snacks and so on. 
The worst part of binge eating is that i don’t even have the appetite or the craving for it, like i don’t enjoy the food or it doesn’t satisfy me when i binge. 
I used to be bulimic as fuck but i overdid it and i lost my gag reflex so that sucks. 
I’ve literally tried everything, i went to a psychologist, a psychiatrist, tried picking up a hobby, keeping myself busy, distracting myself, sleeping early but the psychologist and psychiatrist tells me that same things that don’t work, i can’t put my mind on anything if i don’t binge like there’s always this constant boredom that i can’t get rid of unless i’m overseas..

I thought I was gaining weight, so a month ago I fell back into a little symptom use.

I also have a semi-okay relationship with eating. I crave food, I'll eat full meals, I don't throw up, I'll eat fatty foods, and I don't starve myself. 

However, I've started realizing that my relationship with food is more complicated than I thought. I ate some honey-roasted nuts today (about 30) and I felt guilty and hateful towards myself – even though that was all I'd eaten all day. 

I count calories obsessively. I do try to meet the regular caloric requirements for someone my gender, age, height, and weight – but the fact that I count them obsessively doesn't seem right. Sometimes it's all I seem to think about. 

I frequently will eat something that I KNOW for a fact is less than 500 calories, but I'll tell myself, *I bet that was, like, 700 calories. Slow down.* 

I won't starve myself but I'll...stretch out periods where I don't eat. And when I do this, I feel satisfied with myself. 

I oscillate between totally great self-esteem, where I genuinely believe I look and am awesome, and horrendous self-esteem, where I believe I'm overweight and gross. This is perhaps the oddest thing about me; I'm brimming with equal parts supreme confidence and self-hatred. And I'm constantly thinking, *Gotta slim down.*

the first time i purged was when i was in my mid teens when i used to be obsessed with my weight because everyone else around me was.
i had times where i would not throw up at all but there has been times where i couldnt stop myself from disappearing into the bathroom and get everything out of my stomach right after every meal.
when i graduated high school i magically stopped feeling the urge to vomit and i stopped caring about my weight, i hadnt purged for a while either, and this state remained for about one and a half year.
Now im in my early twenties and in university where i would spend my whole day. I dont really eat over the day cause i forget and i come home naturally hungry. At home i usually eat a normal meal but i hate the feeling of being full so i just empty my stomach to feel the emptiness that leaves me at ease.

The thing is i know that bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder that is characterized by purging and vomiting and the fear of gaining weight.
I only really dont like the feeling of being full, its torture to me to have a full stomach, i dont purge except for when i have bad cravings on period days and i accept my body the way it is.
Am i still considered bulimic or how can i solve the issue of me throwing up my food, without having to tell anyone around me or going to a psychologist?

2206,ez7t90,Request: Overtraining as an eating disorder,"I made the realization today that I might be overtraining, and after further research, I found that this is a form of an eating disorder. Diet-wise, I've become increasingly more obsessive with my eating over the past few years. I've tried several different extreme diets, from carnivore to vegan, or even eating only one meal per day. At the same time I've become more obsessed with my workouts- trying new routines, increasing the time in the gym, etc. I found an old reddit post I made (I think it was deleted) in another sub about how I thought I was maybe overtraining, and now realized that the load I was taking on at that time was significantly lower than it is now. Right now, I'm averaging 1.5-2 hours per day six days per week in the gym. Each day, my average number of sets is anywhere from 50-60. 

I didn't realize this was an issue until I recently met a girl I actually like, and I've been having sexual issues with her. I'm really just not in the mood and it feels like I'm forcing myself, which is frustrating on its own. This has happened with other girls where I just couldn't get in the mood. Once I started researching what my issue might be, I came across overtraining which opened up a huge can of worms about myself. I realized I had become so obsessed with my appearance that I was making huge sacrifices for my diet and exercise regiment. I was cutting out social time with friends and saying no to plans because I needed to go train. I was hitting literally every single symptom of overtraining I found online, from missing family arrangements to severe anxiety on days I wasn't training, to going as hard as possible every single gym session and feeling some depression if I hadn't left the gym feeling like I got my ass kicked. 

I wish I had seen this before, and hopefully I can heal my relationship with food and training. I'm wondering if anyone else has had this before and how it affected their health. The sexual problems really kicked all this off, and it made me realize how much this is affecting both my mental and physical health.

2207,ez1n1s,Request: „It“ goes on breaks -serious?,"I‘ve been thinking a long time about posting this as my issue comes and goes in waves and sometimes, when i‘m having a good streak, i live in complete denial that i even had a problem to begin with and that i just talked myself into it. I need a little clarification on weather or not this is to be taken serious:

Hard facts:
About a year ago i started to restrict my food intake strategically more and more for „fun“. I have always been on the lower range of normal weight, and never had any issues with my appearance whatsoever. I used my control over food to punish and manipulate myself. I always had a „the more little you eat the better“ attitude somehow but it never really got in my way previously.

Months came by and i had cut out a good amount of „blacklisted“ foods and would only eat certain low calorie things. I dropped wight like a wet coat and soon my friends and family started to notice changes. As a semi-pro distance runner, being very lean isnt a rare thing so i could easily justify my weight loss (i was very very toned but never jaw dropping underweight). This is where the disordered part comes in, i started to avoid social occurances that would require me to eat. Restricing so hard would always make me lose control once i ate in front of ppl and i‘d eat fast and huge amounts. After that, of course, i‘d compensate by fasting or running excessively.  

I told my bf about my struggles and he enforced a regular meal plan on me for a month (we live quite far away). I spent some weeks with my family and i feel like since then i‘ve learned that food is fun and its not worth the whole act. This all makes me feel like i am totally in charge, as i can just „turn it off“ for a bit. Before this, i‘d totally panic when having to choose food, especially when i couldn’t prepare it myself. I‘d get very angry at mealtimes. I shouted at my mother a couple times when she simply asked me out for dinner (...). Sometimes i‘d self harm when i ate stuff i regretted afterwards. 

Now i‘m in a new, very intensive training program and i know that if i restrict too hard, i will cause injury and this is my biggest fear as i will lose my favorite way to maintain a normal realationship with food.
I still get uncomfortable above a certain calorie content, i dont count but do a rough estimation. 

When given trash food, i  c/s. I never buy c/s food myself but i dont wanna swallow unnecessary stuff either.

I have abused laxatives quite often, knowwwing that it doesnt do anything (!) but it makes me feel better as i often still feel very guilty after meals.

I have tried purging a couple times, (including last week) especially after drinking and „bingeing“, luckily i never suceeded with it and i rarely attempt it.

I barely cook with oil and fat, always check ingredients and colorie contents and in generall have a very, almost overly healthy diet. My family mistakenly sees me as a „health-guru“ now but i absolutely dont see a point in „fun foods“ and snacking anymore.

 My thoughts are consumed by food. I binge watch food related youtube videos four hours a day.

I am absolutely terrefied of developing binge eating as i feel hyperaware of my food portions/habits and other ppls.

Currently i‘m letting myself very free and even treat myself with „blacklisted“ foods every now and then. I am also (barely) normal weight. I‘m not sure if i‘m just over it, or if it‘s just because i have such a high training volume at the time and know i cant afford injury due to malnutrition.
I truly miss my old, super toned, body tho. I miss the empowerment i got by eating tiny amounts but i can’t do it anymore. I feel like i‘ve been lying to myself the entire time. I feel like this is such a complete luxury problem... i feel guilty for eating and guilty for feeling guilty. There’s people that would kill to be in my place.

Is there any chance my disordered relationship with food is seriously subsiding, or is it rather likely that i just momentarily found a way to keep it under a blanket?

If i’d read my own text as from another person, i‘d tell that person to at least talk with someone professional about it but, yeah my excuses are just soooo good. Its gooing soooo great this month i even had lemon cake today, i mean i must be healed right... ( ha ha ha). No seriously. I feel like if i try i can get back to normal but i also know that everyone thinks that and thats the crux. I dont know if i can trust my thoughts anymore...

Anyways thank you in advance, hope your day was chill :)",1580868147,2/4/2020 20:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ez1n1s/request_it_goes_on_breaks_serious/,2
2208,ez1mdd,Request: Feel like I’m eating “bad” when I have good tasting food.,"I’d like to know if anyone can relate and strategies to help stop this kind of thinking. There wasn’t anything about this on google but surely I’m not alone in this. 

I eat relatively healthy, I have a sweet tooth and don’t deny myself sweet foods. This is the best I’ve ever been after struggling with disordered eating for 5 years. I’ve recently noticed that when I eat something that tastes good I feel like I’m being “bad.” 

I cook a lot of really good seasoned food and I love yogurt, fruit, nuts etc. I wonder if I’m feeling bad about eating good tasting stuff because I used to think enjoying food was a bad thing? I don’t know. At my worst, I ate pretty simple stuff and not a lot of super flavorful foods. I had certain foods that I’d lump into “good” and “bad” categories, and I’ve retained this kind of thinking since it became normal for me. There’re probably only a few things I’d consider “good.”

Any advice or stories would be appreciated. I think this is a big hurdle I’ll need to get over in order to avoid relapses.",1580868075,2/4/2020 20:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ez1mdd/request_feel_like_im_eating_bad_when_i_have_good/,3

I’m a 27 year old male.

Since I was a young child I have pretty much been “unable” to eat fruit and vegetables (I know I should be dead or have scurvy or something by now) I drink a lot of smoothies and take supplements to try and help.

Apparently when I was a toddler I loved them then my parents went to work and I started to stay with my grandad who spoilt me rotten. I then refused to eat vegetables and fruit and would sit at the table all night crying until my parents gave in.

Now whenever I try to eat vegetables the second my teeth crunch on them I gag. I don’t even hate the taste. I one time was eating a pot pie that had carrots peas etc in and I didn’t realise. I was eating away enjoying it until I realised what it was and then couldn’t eat more.

Since I met my wife she has been pushing me to eat better and I really want to and do try. I have to cut a tiny piece of veg and eat it in the same mouthful as a bunch of meat or whatever just so I don’t notice it.

I want to just eat normally I want to not have to scour the ingredients in a meal to make sure it doesn’t have something I won’t like. 

I feel like the only solution is I just gotta suck it up and eat my veg but just guess I’m hoping somebody might be able to offer some advice",1580813015,2/4/2020 4:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/eyo9ko/request_new_here_trying_to_post/,5

2216,exkrku,"Request: I've been purge-free for a month now, but new issues are coming up","i posted to this subreddit in early December 2019 about my binging/purging habits and how i desperately wanted to get them under control. first and foremost, i wanted to thank everyone who gave advice from the bottom of my heart. it means the world.

I'm very, very proud to say that I made a promise to myself in late December that I'd at least get a hold of my purging, and since the 28th-ish, I haven't purged at all. it's a baby step, but is definitely a big deal for me. :D

however, I'm still binging. I think my binging habits are getting worse, too. and i don't know what to do because I really, REALLY don't want to go back to purging, but it's so difficult not to when I've been eating so much. I've become practically obsessed with food and once i start eating, I can't stop. even if I feel sick to my stomach. and again, this makes it really difficult not to purge, and i seriously don't want to go back to doing that. 

i've tried some tips that my friends have given me/stuff I've found online, but none of it really works. for example, the 60% rule. I've tried to just eat a little over half of a meal, do something else, and then come back, but my brain always convinces me to just finish the food, even if I've decided that i'm not hungry and don't need any more. even if I put the rest of it in the fridge to eat later, i still manage to convince myself to go get it and finish it. or, if i stop eating the moment I no longer feel hungry and put the food away, the same thing happens. I convince myself that a little more won't hurt and i end up eating the entire thing and then some. not to mention snacking. i could probably make up 2-4 full meals just with the snacks i eat on a daily basis. i know it's awful, but it's like i physically can't stop eating. 

I always feel terrible both emotionally AND physically because of all this. what do i do????? are there any steps i can take to reduce my binging? thanks so much!",1580627517,2/2/2020 1:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/exkrku/request_ive_been_purgefree_for_a_month_now_but/,3

What sucks is how they all seem to somewhat normalize ED behaviours. I’ve talked to them about my ED and my triggers, but quite honestly they’re kinda clueless about what fits as a trigger, if that makes sense.

One of the things I’m really struggling with is how they all seem to engage in / talk about ED behaviours as if it’s normal. They’ll casually comment on how they skipped a meal, or how one time they went XYZ long without food, or how they’re gonna do ABC to compensate.

In my head, I guess I’m having trouble because it’s like, if everyone’s doing it, why can’t I? If this is normal, why can’t I join in with them. I know it’s not normal, but especially when people say things like “oh everyone has had sOme ED in their lifetime”, it feels really invalidating and makes me want to relapse.",1580589416,2/1/2020 14:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/exc7dt/request_dealing_with_triggers/,10

2224,ewmo01,Request: How can I support my roommate in her recovery?," 

I need advice on how to best support my roommate (early 20s professional) in her recovery. We live in a rural state with no inpatient services, so she's been in a program in California for about three months. We exchange letters and I sent her books for Christmas. We didn't talk about her ED before she left, though it was both physically and behaviorally obvious. I wanted to respect her autonomy as an adult and not sound patronizing, but I wish I'd brought up my concerns directly. She mentioned she was in therapy pre-hospitalization, but always in a scheduling context like ""I can't go out Friday, I have a therapy appointment."" I assumed since she was already seeking treatment, the best thing I could do was just treat her normally and be a good friend. Her ED was always a giant elephant in the room for me.

I don't want to push her to talk about her disorder past what she chooses to tell me in her letters. During the first couple weeks of her hospitalization, she was open about wanting to get better and the challenges of her program. Now, she mostly wants to hear about my life rather than talk about treatment and seems bored and antsy in the hospital. I don't know what her treatment schedule is like or when she'll come home. I don't want to dance around her illness, but I'm not comfortable asking her directly when she'll be back or if she's even going to live with us again (her parents are nearby). I also want to know if there's anything I can do to make the transition easier, but I don't want to sound patronizing.

Typically he is a fairly healthy eater, at a normal weight. However in the past year just eating a normal meal, especially in the evenings, takes sooo long it is concerning. I feel like I eat at a “normal” pace. But he will still be eating, HOURS after I am finished. He says he is eating as fast as he can. He does eat all of his food, so it’s not that he isn’t getting the nutrition he needs. I am concerned now though at the actual amount of time it takes him to eat a meal. I don’t want to make him feel bad, but I am concerned. Is eating just a normal meal for 2-3 hours considered normal? Is there anything I can do to help? It’s interfering with plans, being able to eat at a restaurant, etc. He doesn’t do things while eating, such as playing on his phone or computer.

Hello!

My name is Melissa and I’m a PhD researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London. My research is focusing on interoception, which refers to your awareness of internal sensations happening inside your body (e.g. heartbeat, breathing, temperature, blood pressure etc.). I’m also looking at the relationship between interoception and the development and maintenance of eating disorders.

During my PhD, I’m planning many different sorts of experiments to investigate this. Some of them will just be online questionnaires, whereas others might involve some testing in-person. Some of my experiments will include payment for people who take part (hooray!) whereas others will unfortunately be voluntary.

If any of you are interested in being involved, I’ve included a link at the bottom of this post to a questionnaire where you’ll be asked to provide your email address as well as a few demographic questions. This is so you can be included on a database for future studies and contacted whenever something comes up that you fit the criteria for. The database will be password protected and your email won’t be shared with ANYONE else or for any other purpose.

The questionnaire should only take about 2 minutes. If we have a study that you’re eligible to take part in then you’ll receive an email, but feel free to ignore it if you’re not interested. If at any point you want your email address removed from the database, please let me know!

5 years into recovery but some recent life stress causing a drop in weight. Keeping my intake high, but I have gotten into this rut of compulsively needing to move.

Always been very athletic so trying to cut back on high intensity workouts for now- but it feels like . I find myself running to the train station, going on walks to pace as breaks during work, bounding up stairs 3 at a time.

I know this isn’t normal, but it feels good, maybe lessens anxiety? I know long term I really need to put on some weight to get back to a healthy place and its not healthy to be always needing to move. My ability to focus at work and enjoy many social activities is interrupted by this discomfort with stillness.

Hey there,
To keep things short, I used to suffer quite a lot with my body image (in particular weight) and generally hate how awkward I looked. I’ve been kind of okay in recent years but I’ve felt it kind of coming back recently. I just feel like I look awkward and uncool and I think it’s down to my weight and posture (even though it’s probably all in my head). 

Basically I’ve kind of been keeping it in check and doing okay, but then today my partner said something that made me feel so hurt and made all of those feelings come back, and kind of crushed all self confidence I’d been building to stop myself getting into bad habits again. We were watching a video and my partner said to wait because someone comes up who looks like me, and I did, for like 10mins, and then the person who came up kind of did look like me when I was really awkward and a bit bigger and generally had bad posture and thin lips and things that made me feel really insecure. And so I felt like that’s how they see me still though I’m trying to not be like that, and it just kind of killed me inside.

I’m trying not to get upset about it and not get back into bad thoughts but I can’t stop it - I feel just so upset and like I don’t want anyone to look at me if that’s what they see.

2242,f1peyo,Request: How to stop spiralling again?," 

I was raised by a mother who had eating disorder and body dysmorphia, since I’m alive she has always been on a diet, exercising after every bite. Growing up, it was inevitable to develop a fear of scales and constantly comparing my body to my mum’s. I am at a healthy weight and so is my mum but whenever my mum called herself fat, it would just push me even deeper. I had quite bad teenage years with going to sleep with growling stomach way too many times. My budding depression and anxiety didn’t help either and it just turned into a vicious circle after a while. I moved faaar away from home 2 years ago, since then I improved a lot but I still calorie-count which I didn’t think it was a problem as I could maintain my weight for more than a year now, even through exam periods which I was really proud of.

Present Today at dinner, my inner calculator notified me that if I would eat the whole of my dinner, I would reach my “daily recommended intake” (which I more often shoot under to make sure) today which made me feel really panicky. I let my partner know who is extremely supportive and he tried to explain it to me how that is the recommended not the limit which I know but don’t know know (I hope this makes sense). I ended up crying and eating only half of my dinner. But right now I just feel like a failure as it looks like all the body positivity and recovery I’ve been working on since moving away from home was/is so fragile that even the option of reaching the recommended intake breaks it all.

How could I stop myself spiralling again? I really don’t want to get back to 16 year old me, I’ve been working way too hard but right now I’m not sure if it was worth it at all.”",1581336584,2/10/2020 6:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f1peyo/request_how_to_stop_spiralling_again/,0

2246,f1pe2o,"Request: losing weight, what's going on?","hello! so I'm at quite a loss as to what to do with my weight. I've always been kind of underweight but I'm also quite small so I thought it was normal, until I realized that I've been losing weight as I age. I've lost a large amount compared to before and I don't know how to gain it back up. I'm not sure if its a mental or physical problem. 
I've had quite a few physical medical problems but they all end up leading to being normal. I even got misdiagnosed with an auto-immune disease but the doctors later said it was a mistake, although I still get blood tests every so often just in case.
As for something mentally, I'm not quite sure if I've an eating disorder or not. I researched a few and none of them seem to describe me. I don't binge eat, throw up, obsess over calories, none of that. I just sometimes don't have an appetite and I get full way too fast, leading to me eating like a mouse. When I get full and attempt to eat more, I feel sickly and like I'm going to throw up. I also sometimes feel guilty or scared to eat. I feel guilty because it feels awful wasting food by not eating it all and I've gotten a few people call me out for being wasteful. And I feel scared for numerous reasons and I believe my parents play a role in this. My mom basically freaked out when I got misdiagnosed. She started to make health shakes for me which I think tastes disgusting and she wont change the recipe because she says other people like them and so should I.. I still don't drink them. (My tastes are very limited, I dislike sweets because I get nauseous. I mostly prefer dry plain food.) My family also has some deep-rooted mental problems so they yell/get mad a lot, resulting in me becoming sad and losing all will to eat. I've skipped meals plenty times because of this.
Lately, I've been more motivated so I've presented my mom a few times with mini grocery lists. She immediately says its all just junk and unhealthy, even though there's only about 2-3 dessert items. Speaking of junk, when I eat the only edible thing left (we've a lot of random ingredients but no actual food) she says it's super unhealthy and tells me I'm going to get diabetes and get a heart attack and die. She tends to be like that with any food so I get scared eating anything around her. I've snuck food to my room sometimes. I'm also scared to exercise because I'm afraid I'm going to lose even more weight, so I'm not that active other than walking a mile each day.
Despite all this, I personally feel like I've been eating a lot but having recently checked my weight, I've lost more. I'm scared if its some sort of disease/ED because I know my mom will freak out again, but if I maintain a strong mind I might be able to get better if I know what to do.
Has any of you had a similar experience and found a resolution? Or do you think it's an odd ED of some sort? I'm at a loss so any advice would be helpful. Thank you!",1581336464,2/10/2020 6:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f1pe2o/request_losing_weight_whats_going_on/,2

After every meal I will often eat a snack.

That's all I eat everyday.  I don't know what to do.  I sometimes feel self conscious about my weight because everyone always compliments how skinny I am and it feels almost like a personality at this point.

But that's not what my issue is, at least not that I know of.  For about a decade year I've been weirdly afraid of food.  Like I can't eat food like pizza because it looks so gross to me.  I won't eat meat because it's gross to me, or cupcakes, or most cakes except for icecream cake, I won't eat anything at all.  When I'm at a restaurant for family gatherings all that I order will be a glass of water or a diet Coke.  I just don't eat.  And I feel full when I just eat a pack of ritz crackers.  I feel tired all the time but I also don't sleep well.  I don't know what's wrong with me and it's upsetting me and it makes me want to cry because I don't know how to fix myself.  My mother and friends worry about my diet because they don't see me eat much at all at during lunch and I'll have the weirdest eating patterns.  Sometimes I'll eat dinner at midnight and other times I'll eat at sunset in the afternoon and that will be my last meal of the day.

She asked if her toothbrush was still there, and I said yes, but she wasn’t allowed to throw up in my apartment. This led to an argument between us, mostly centered around my not knowing how to support her (my firm refusal came off as condescending, she knows her disorder/what she needs more than I do, etc.). She said she would just find a different bathroom to use, and while I obviously want her to be safe, I don’t think that means opening up my apartment as a welcome zone for purging.

Growing up, it was inevitable to develop a fear of scales and constantly comparing my body to my mum’s. I am at a healthy weight and so is my mum but whenever my mum called herself fat, it would just push me even deeper. I had quite bad teenage years with going to sleep with growling stomach way too many times. My budding depression and anxiety didn’t help either and it just turned into a vicious circle after a while. I moved faaar away from home 2 years ago, since then I improved a lot but I still calorie-count which I didn’t think it was a problem as I could maintain my weight for more than a year now, even through exam periods which I was really proud of.

Present Today at dinner, my inner calculator notified me that if I would eat the whole of my dinner, I would reach my “daily recommended intake” (which I more often shoot under to make sure) today which made me feel really panicky. I let my partner know who is extremely supportive and he tried to explain it to me how that is the recommended not the limit which I know but don’t know know (I hope this makes sense). I ended up crying and eating only half of my dinner. But right now I just feel like a failure as it looks like all the body positivity and recovery I’ve been working on since moving away from home was/is so fragile that even the option of reaching the recommended intake breaks it all.

How could I stop myself spiralling again? I really don’t want to get back to 16 year old me, I’ve been working way too hard but right now I’m not sure if it was worth it at all.”",1581071984,2/7/2020 4:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f08s8p/request_how_to_stop_spiraling_again/,6

2258,ezvose,Request: What's my next move?,"Hi all,

I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for with this post. Probably an answer I have to find within myself rather than from strangers on the internet, but I guess I wanted to get a sense of how much of this information resonates with the other people on here.

I'm a 26yo woman who has always had a 'normal' BMI. I had no prior diet history before last year. I have always been involved in sports or the gym throughout the years in some way, and have no major childhood trauma, but my sister was anorexic when I was growing up and my mom has been on and off weight watchers forever, so there was definitely diet talk at home and alot of anxiety around EDs.

TW (sexual assault)

I was sexually assaulted by a very close friend when I was 23, in August 2016. This caused me to enter a major depressive episode for which I was medicated with escitalopram for about a year. I was in a committed relationship when it happened and initially the rape was seen as a form of cheating, and this fed into some self hatred that I'm still dealing with, as well as huge amounts of self doubt and feelings of powerlessness/lack of control.

I got off meds last winter and married this same partner this past summer. He has been such a wonderful support through all of this and getting through this trauma together really solidified for us that we could commit to one another for life and get through anything. (woo!)

I think my problems arose when I was trying to shift from CBT/meds to solo-coping with my depression. I turned initially to the gym, and got really into lifting and body building. I liked that it made me feel powerful (after feeling powerless to stop the assault). I really enjoyed having that routine after a hard day at school, and the feeling of making progress in some dimension of life when other things weren't working out. Being able to control my body was obviously also comforting. 

With the wedding looming, I started to feel pressure to look perfect on that day. However, the weight lifting had made me start to get really hungry, and I started to feel out of control around food. I had many experiences that I would describe as a binge just by the sheer speed at which I ate, the level of pain I was willing to put up with in terms of how full I got, and the fact that I actually sought out this painfully full feeling. I also became obsessed with foodie instagrams and tasty videos. I think these were also forms of coping/avoiding negative emotions, and the degree to which I'm exaggerating the bingey-ness of these binges is hard for me to figure out (i.e. maybe they just seem like binges because i thought i should be losing weight). This caused me a lot of guilt and shame and made me really anxious for my upcoming wedding.

I started tracking calories in response to this a bit, but initially found it only increased my hunger/obsessive food content consumption, so I gave up for a bit. Once it was clear my weight wasn't going down and the wedding was really close, I re-downloaded myfitnesspal. I also started running and increased the number of hiit/zumba sessions I attended in addition to lifting. I also found alot of enjoyment in running and definitely get the runners high/flow state feeling when I'm doing it for the right reasons.

At first, weight loss was really slow, but I ended up losing most of the weight I had wanted to for the wedding. I was getting alot of compliments, and really felt like I was doing things 'right' by prioritizing strength training, keeping my protein high, not cutting food groups or tons of calories etc. I saw the end result as maybe being a temporary thing and wasn't worried about the possibility of regain.

Then came the honeymoon, which was absolutely amazing, but I came back with this firm idea that I needed to correct for what I had done and get back to my post-wedding weight. it no longer was acceptable to me to regain the weight. For several months after, I have become more and more rigid in my restrictions and exercise rituals. I now get intense anxiety if I can't exercise, and feel a strong need to compensate if i have anything social planned, or even when my husband comes to stay with me (we're long distance for the time being) because I know I'll eat more. I don't let him do the cooking and weigh alot of stuff. I started seeing exercise as a form of offsetting my calories and it lost alot of its original enjoyment.

In november, i went to france for a workshop (im a phd student in my final year - talk about a feeling of a lack of control about my future) and they fed us these amazing 4 course meals, which were so amazing, but made me compelled to sometimes run twice a day, and in the worst case I attempted purging a couple times. I actually shared this with my husband but in a 'i cant believe i let myself get there, it won't happen again' kind of way.

This past christmas, my parents saw me for the first time since the wedding and my mom confronted me about my weight loss. I got really defensive and angry and told her I wasnt doomed to have anorexia like my sister and that I love weight lifting etc, but it did make me take a look at myself and the fact my weight has continued to decline, I'm noticeably thinner than at my wedding when that wasn't my goal (I had been trying to reverse diet but kept underestimating my maintenance calories because im so scared of overshooting). Also, I felt I had to makeup for the christmas eating and got myself to a scarily euphoric state of starvation a few times that really freaked me out. This made me think it was time to get help and admit I have a problem.

This made me so mad at myself. Is this coping strategy that I thought would save me hurting me? Am I really this vain even though I never cared about dieting before (this is alot of internalized stigma i have around the 'kind of person' who gets an ED)? Do I have to give up all this structure I've built into my life and if so how am I going to handle the trauma and anxiety that will come back as a result? On top of this, why did my husband or any of my friends not notice? How did everyone let me get here?

BIG CAVEAT- At the same time, i've had a hard time figuring out if all of my weight loss has been intentional. I've been having hormonal issues for the past year where my birth control pill has not regulated my periods properly (I get 2 periods per month instead of 1). I've been getting a bunch of tests to figure out why (potentially fibroids, thyroid stuff), and have mentioned my weight to doctors several times and they've been like nah your BMI is healthy and if anything you'd lose your period not get an extra one. And recently this has made me think that maybe I have something else wrong with me medically that is at least compounding my weight loss. I know this could just be me not wanting to fully admit I'm at fault here, but it does seem like the speed of my weight loss is incongruent with my level of restriction. This isn't to say that I had an unhealthy level of enjoyment as a response to the weight loss, but it doesn't seem to add up to me.

TDLR; I'm wondering if anyone can speak to rigid food/exercise habits as a response to trauma and replacement as a coping mechanism after meds/therapy, and to how EDs can be confusing to separate from other medical concerns.

2259,ezqkjx,Request: Feeling lost at inpatient treatment program," 

Recently, after a period of being extremely underweight and forcefully hospitalized for medical stabilization, I have now been placed (did not have a choice as to where) in an inpatient program for eating disorders.

I've been feeling rather lost because I, unlike some other ED sufferers, do not struggle with body image issues. In fact, I felt extremely ashamed of my body when I was so underweight. I was teased by others as well, and the shame that I felt sort of worsened my bad habits, because I felt as though any effort that I made to better my situation was pointless.

My treatment team is not sure what my disorder is, but they mentioned ARFID as a possibility. This is because I am afraid of throwing up and dislike the physical discomfort or pain that I feel after eating. I also struggle with a very low appetite in general. It's rather unfortunate that the treatment program that I am in does not cater to individuals exactly. A lot of the discussions in group therapy surround body image and fear of gaining weight. Throughout all this, I feel almost a bit excluded, and as if my issues are less valid than those of others.

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this sense of exclusion at inpatient treatment. Or, if anyone has had an experience with treatment centers that tried a more individualized approach, I would love to read about it.

Im having all these thoughts of ""to eat less"" and that ""I should only eat more than x amount"" and whenever I do eat, I have recurring thoughts of the BN. This week/end I havent eaten hardly anything (including drinking liquids) and whenever I do, my stomach hurts. Could this be an ED of some sort? Or just weird eating habits?

2266,f694it,Request: partner support required - binge eating,"Hi there,

I met my girlfriend when she was in recovery from anorexia. I had no idea at the time but she eventually opened up a few months later. She fell pregnant and it was tough for her dealing with such rapid weight gain but she got through it and we now have a beautiful 15 month old together.

Her ED has always fluctuated through the relationship but the anorexia has kinda gone away and been replaced with binging. Luckily no purging.

She stated that it was what her body needed to do and it would help her get better by doing this otherwise she would feel there was too much control and it would trigger the anorexia again. Fair enough, I thought, and ran with it.

It's now getting out of hand to the point where I can't afford to replace the food as quick as it's disappearing. I'm supporting the 3 of us on my wage alone and it's a standard nurses wage, nothing special but it covers rent and bills. 

For example I went and spent the last of my money on a food shop (£80) and within that I bought snack foods. They've all gone. All of it. All the bread too. I know it sounds petty but the cycle will dictate that later on I'll need to now go out and replace all the food she's eaten so she can do it again. I just can't afford it and it's breaking me. 

I've tried talking to her and it just turns to an argument where I am controlling and I don't understand and she can't help it. I get it, I do. It's impulsiveness, anxiety and guilt that are one aspect of a driving force but I just want some kind of balance and for her to take responsibility. 

I'm sorry for the rant. It's stressful. I'm an RNLD in challenging behaviour rehab and our son has a heart condition so every aspect of my life is just stress right now and I know I may not always get it right but I'm trying and I want to help her get through this.

I'm after some personal experiences/advice from others with disordered eating.

A bit about me. I'm 31 and suffered with severe bulimia and restricted eating from 15-23. I never fully escaped the beast, but my symptoms were manageable and I was doing really quite well until about 18 months ago. Long story short bad social circumstances and playing higher level competitive sport led to over exercising and the achievement of what was close to my perfect body image. Then I rotated into a job that utterly destroyed me. I had to give up my sport, I couldn't exercise and I fell into a pretty shitty depression. Hello full blown relapse and body dysmorphia resurgence (do not recommend 😂). So I quit my job, yay, and am back in an intensive treatment program. But I have become really fixated on a residual issue that never really went away. Like I have no boobs, I look like a 12 yo boy for 3 weeks out of the month, and I have a really square torso. I have forever felt like breast augmentation would make me less box shaped and help my body image.

Now, I'm very aware that I am still acutely unwell, allbeit getting better slowly. But I was thinking about going up a couple of sizes when I'm better. But before I do I want to hear everyone's experiences to weigh up the risk benefit from a psyche pov.

2268,f5zbgg,Request: subject: struggling to eat vegan - is it worth it?,"

Background: I turned vegan in Fall of 2018. Prior to this, my consistent weight was about (healthy weight). When I turned vegan, I was (healthy weight), and within 1-2 months I was down to (also healthy weight). I'm currently around (a little under healthy weight).

I struggle to eat more than just enough to leave me satisfied, and am consistently hungry, I usually eat just because if not I'll get hangry and because I know I need to. I never had any problems with this before. When I turned vegan, I also started taking an antidepressant that killed my appetite for several months. 

I'm vegan for animal rights / ethical reasons, not health reasons. I wonder if it's worth it to stay vegan, if it's adversely affecting my health in this way. I want to, but it's getting unhealthy. Anytime anybody sees me, they comment on how much skinnier I am from the last time they saw me. I wonder if eating some dairy products / eggs and maybe chicken would help me find food that was easier, faster, and cheaper to make (cost when buying processed/preprepared foods). It would also make it easier to find food with a wider variety of flavors that I could eat. Especially when in a depression slump.

I take adhd medication which means i have barely any appetite anyway,  but when I do feel hungry I have all these rituals to make me eat as little as possible.

I then put the actual food that I cooked on a small plate and cut into tiny pieces, then eat one bite every 30 seconds to make sure I'm slow and mindful when I eat. All my food is low carb vegan, weighed and calorie counted. If I don't know the exact calories I can't eat anything. 

After all those rituals I sometimes can't even finish the food, which always feels like an accomplishment. When I finish it I usually feel strangely guilty even though I WANT to gain muscle and be more healthy. 

How can I let go of these rituals? Every interaction i have with food is focused on making me consume as little as possible. On the rare occasions I'm able to eat more I just run and work out more to compensate.

I have been struggling a lot recently with my depression (also a lifelong issue) and was struck with both mono and strep throat at the same time back in November. Because of that I lost a lot of weight suddenly and haven’t been able to get it back. This isn’t my problem though. I hate how small and skinny I am and always have. But I feel like I don’t deserve to eat, so I have started to severely restrict what I take in. I don’t like it and I don’t want to but I can’t stop myself from doing it because I feel like I shouldn’t eat. I want to gain the weight back and feel healthy again but it’s only getting worse. My fiancé has been trying to get me to eat and has gotten me nutritional shakes but he can only be with me so much throughout the day, and even when he is it’s a struggle and I say I’m fine or I’m not hungry. I’ve lost a lot of my appetite and can see the effect it’s having on my health and overall well-being. I don’t know if this is the right subreddit to go for this, or if anyone has experienced this or something like it, but I’m hoping someone can relate to this experience and has some advice on how to handle it and get better.",1582022649,2/18/2020 4:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f5pygi/request_feel_like_i_dont_deserve_to_eat/,2

Hi, I'm 16 years old and was recently diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa and depression as well kind of (psychiatrist has spoken lots about me being depressed but never written it down). I've been bad eating disorder wise for around 6 months but not great/developing it for maybe a year or so?

My psychiatrist has recommended me the antidepressant Sertraline (Zoloft) as an option to help me recover and cope with depression which we believe triggered it but I am unsure as to whether it is a good option. We are looking at setting a date to hospitalise me if I don't improve alone and this might help. I'm wondering if any of you guys have any experience with Sertraline, Sertraline and marijuana usage as well as trying to start recovering because I'm really struggling to...

Hi. I’m In denial that I have an eating disorder and maybe I don’t but maybe I do. I was neglected as a child and grew up in a toxic environment so it adds up that I might have a problem. I go through a binge/starve cycle. Growing up the only eating disorders talked about were starving or binging and purging, therefore I have neglected my issues for years. I eat about xxx (few) calories a day and I am a 6’2 female. Some days I am so starved that I eat everything In sight. To a disgusting degree. I’ve gotten to a point where I can’t tell if my eating routine is toxic or not. Monday - Thursday I eat a bar for breakfast and then a bowl of cauliflower for dinner. Friday-Sunday I eat everything I see. Even if I’m sickly full. Is this unhealthy??? Do I need help?? I’m so fucking confused. I’ve always been the person to say “someone Is struggling a lot more than I am therefore my problems don’t really matter” but does that really take away from the severity of my own problems???

it feels like a punishment from anorexia. it feels like it’s punishing me for getting rid of it and caring about myself. i feel so much guilt for taking care of myself and not paying enough attention to the relationship. it feels like him falling out of love with me is all my fault. plus i gained weight through weight restoration and i can’t help but think he thinks i’m fat, ugly, and disgusting now. 

this just makes me want to go backwards and relapse :( i know it’s a bad idea because i did so much hard work, but it’s so tempting to go back to my old habits.

my therapist told me something that was helpful: that i’ve improved myself and am healthy now and he’s missing out on the real me. but at the same time, i just wish that wasn’t true and i wish i didn’t have to do this without him, he was my best friend. :(

2287,f48blp,Request: What kind of questions do therapists normally ask ED patients about their disorder?,"After years of struggling with BN as well as some other mental health issues, I started seeing a therapist a few months ago.  I’m currently overweight. I haven’t always been overweight according to BMI, however I grew up in an abusive household and I can’t remember a time in my life when I wasn’t constantly worried about my size and obsessing over food. The frustrating part is that no matter what I weigh, my body image is exactly the same. 

Sometimes my therapist will ask me questions, like if I’m trying to lose weight, or if I was “chubby” as a kid/teenager.  I don’t know why, but every time I get asked things like this, I take it as my therapist implying that I need to be losing weight, or that because I’m overweight now I *obviously* must have *always* been that way. I’m constantly afraid that because I’m overweight, my therapist probably thinks I’m lying about having an ED.  I’m having a really hard time being able to tell if I’m just being really over-sensitive, or if these are actually not supposed to be okay questions to ask.  (My SO thinks it’s me overreacting.)  Out of everything I’m in therapy for, food and weight is the issue I hate talking about most. 

I guess my question is, are these normal things for a therapist to ask about?  For those of you who have tried therapy, what have your experiences been like?

2291,f3h0uc,"Request: I have anorexia, I'm feeling a bit lost and scared and idk what to do.","Hi everyone,

At the start of last semester, I started my transition (MtF). I live in a very conservative area, and was deathly afraid of using gendered restrooms (mens are humiliating and unsafe, women felt unsafe, and I couldn't find any gender neutral ones). I started just not eating as much food, and started skipping lunch entirely, so that I wouldn't have to use the restrooms while at school. 

Then one day I weighed myself, and found that I had lost a lot of weight, and I really liked seeing that number go down. So I kept tracking my weight, and started eating even less. I completely cut out sodas, then completely cut out deserts. Food started rotting in my house because I just wasn't eating almost anything. 

And the body image issues I had really didn't help. Especially when cis people feel the need to advertise how disgusting and unattractive they find trans women. I know I'm ugly, but do people really have to be so mean about it?

I'm also worried about what people will think if I tell them that I have an ED, since I'm overweight. People probably just think that me going from hugely obese to the overweight I am now is just me being more healthy.

But under eating has become a problem now. I've been dizzy, I'm tired all the time, I'm having a lot of trouble paying attention in class, I'm having a harder time solving problems in my science classes, and physical tasks have become far more demanding (estrogen accounts for some of this, but not the full degree of it). And I'm scared of some of the things that I read can happen as a result of Anorexia. I don't want to die, I don't want to kidney problems. 

The thing is though, eating is hard now. Even small portions make me feel bloated and nauseous and like I'm going to throw up. Food tastes off; when I had a small PB&amp;J sandwich, it just tasted sickeningly sweet, and I had to force myself to finish it.

2295,f37zg3,Request: New post - am I experiencing disordered eating or just being reactionary?,"Hi mods. Thanks for reading. 


Reddit, I’m turning to you for some help and guidance. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this as I’m worried that I’ll make my family or friends overly concerned about something that might be nothing. 

Little background on me - I was diagnosed bipolar a year ago and Ive struggled with depression and anxiety for years. I usually am experiencing either depression or hypomania with not a ton of a break in between. 

I’ve been underweight for most of my life due to a combo of Crohn’s and anxiety. But lately I’ve been developing a pattern of restriction that I recognize might be considered disordered eating. I’ve been seeing myself as gaining weight in areas that really mess with my self esteem and I guess this is how I’m dealing with it. 

For the past months or so I usually either try to wait for lunch to eat, or I’ll eat a healthy oatmeal breakfast cookie thing if I feel really light headed. For lunch I usually have a frozen veggie burger with a few bites of fruit. I’ll usually eat a normal dinner unless I’m going out to eat in which case I limit myself to half of my plate. 

My question for y’all is should I be worried? Is this just healthy eating or am I falling off the edge into disordered eating? Should I bring this up to my therapist or husband? Part of me feels like I’m just making this up in my head and I’ll go back to normal soon. But I also don’t want people to judge or bother me on my eating. I don’t want to feel watched if someone thinks I am not eating enough. Especially if this is nothing. I have a pretty high wall around me when it comes to sharing my vulnerabilities and I tend to try to go it on my own rather than seek help. But I’m just confused and need guidance. Thanks in advance for any insight.",1581589307,2/13/2020 4:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f37zg3/request_new_post_am_i_experiencing_disordered/,1
2296,f37zel,Request: My mom's dieting reminds me of my own ED and I'm very worried about her,"I dealt with an eating disorder for about a year. I had EDNOS. I was constantly worrying about my weight and how much I was eating, even if it was minimal. With the help of therapy I've improved a lot and I'm at a healthy place. I have a slightly overweight BMI but I know that it's okay. My diet is good with normal portions and plenty of nutrition. That's the most important thing and I won't cut back just to fit into some number like I used to.

My concern here isn't with myself but with my mom. She was the one who helped fuel my disordered eating in the first place. She would constantly talk down about people who were very overweight. She often poked at my own weight, particularly when I was a young kid. She never noticed my ED and never said anything or tried to help me. When I reached out for support she said I didn't need it. With all of that history and mistreatment, the way she talks about weight is a difficult point for me. She is aware of this and the fact that I used to have an ED but she doesn't seem to care. 

She's exhibited a lot of disordered eating behavior for a while but it seems to just keep getting worse. She's counting calories and is hardly eating anything. She insists she isn't hungry just like I used to. She often says ""I shouldn't eat anything since I'm getting so fat,"" even though her weight gain is fairly normal for a woman her age. She claims that when she says ""fat"" she means that she feels bloated but she talks constantly about her weight. I tried to reach out to her but she seems to think this is fine and healthy like I did. She just claims that she's eaten a ton even though it's nowhere near enough food to provide proper nutrition, much less a proper meal.

This isn't every single day. Sometimes she does eat full meals. However I'd say the majority of days are like this. She's aware mental health is an issue but seems convinced she's fine even though she deals with a lot of issues. My dad is controlling and won't let anyone other than me get therapy so she can't get professional help. I'm worried about her and I don't know what to do. She seems to be suffering just like I did but I have no way to reach out or get her help. This is also extremely stressful because we have similar body types. When she talks down about herself I feel she's looking at me in the same way because she did in the past.

Is there anything I can do to help her? I feel that unless she gets severely sick nobody will realize anything is wrong. I hate being unable to do anything and I'm very afraid for her.",1581589297,2/13/2020 4:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f37zel/request_my_moms_dieting_reminds_me_of_my_own_ed/,2
2297,f37zco,Request: Should I be worried about my eating habits/ am I at risk for an eating disorder?,"This is long but I think I genuinely need help and I don’t know what else to do. (18F) Over the past few months i’ve had a sudden obsession with my weight/appearance. I’ve always had an obsession but it’s never been this extreme. 

I take concerta for ADHD and sertraline for anxiety and depression, and side effects include appetite loss and nausea. I recently decided to take advantage of these side effects and barely eat anything during the day. It’s bad to take these meds without food, but i always feel too nauseous to eat in the morning when i take them. During the school day I feel nauseous, light headed, dizzy, overly tired, shaky, and super hungry even though i have no appetite. 

By the time my meds wear off (around 5ish pm), I get irritable and very hungry. I eat whatever is for dinner that night and even though it’s not nearly as many calories as I should be getting, I still always feel guilty after eating. Lately i’ve been eating dinner and then hiding in my bathroom to throw up as much of it as I can. Then, when I feel less full or bloated, I head to the gym and do vigorous exercise for at least an hour. I always make sure I burn far more calories than I consume that day.

Since i’ve been doing this, i’ve lost a significant amount of weight in a short time, which is exciting yet also concerning.

On weekends when I don’t take my meds, I lose control and binge without purging afterwards. I always hate myself when I see that I gained a tiny bit of weight over the weekend, so the following week consists of more restriction and purging. 

I constantly weigh myself, measure myself, and examine my body in the mirror. Since I was in 5th grade I remember hating the way I looked even though I’ve been a healthy weight my entire life.

I’m happy that i’m losing weight so fast, but after looking into it I’m wondering if it’s because I’m on the brink of an eating disorder. I’ve confided in my best friend and she thinks my habits are concerning and she’s noticed changes in my behavior and appearance.

2299,f37z7t,Request: Recovering Bulimic,"I've been struggling with bulimia for more than a decade now. I read the ""Hunger Hormones"" post and I have to say it has put a lot of things into perspective. 

For the last decade, I've cycled dietarily in the sense that I go through periods where I restrict and overexecise and then I binge/purge and don't do anything. (It doesn't help that I have bipolar 1disorder) But, reading about hormones made me realize that restricting is not a sign of mental strength the same way that binging/purging is not a sign of mental weakness. 

I now know that the first step to recovery is understanding myself on a biological level. I shouldn't fear my hunger. I shouldn't fear my urges. Thanks to the ""Hunger Hormones"" post, I understand that the next twelve months (even the rest of my life) can be months of mental and physical healing. However, despite what I've just learned, I don't know where to truly begin. Feel free to send advice my way.

2301,f37yrv,Request: I have PICA and am addicted to eating detergent,"Let me (19F) start off with saying the courage i needed to build up to speak about this took far longer than i had hoped for it to. 

Pica is an eating disorder that involves eating items that are not typically thought of as food and that do not contain significant nutritional value, such as-but are not limited to-hair, dirt, and paint chips. Many women develop pica throughout a term in their pregnancy, some deal with it their entire lives. I have never met another individual in person-at least nobody willing to open up about it-that suffers with dealing with this disorder. 

My addiction started when i was two years old and my mother would find me sucking on dryer sheets that had fallen out of baskets of freshly done laundry as she carried them throughout the house. She monitered me closely soon after and made sure to keep them out of reach, but never looked further into as to why i was doing so; after all, i was 2, and toddlers will eat just about anything they can get their hands on. My cravings subsided until around age 12 my family was struggling for money so my mother began substituting every day items for things she could prepare for a more affordable price on her own. One of which was laundry detergent. She began mixing pink zote soap, oxi clean, and washing powder into a large bucket to create homemade laundry detergent. I cant even remember what possessed me to do so but one day i licked my finger, dipped it inside the bucket and spread the powder on my tongue. I continued to do so until my tongue burned. I did this every day in the morning, after school, and as many times as i could throughout the day before going to bed. Soon after i would place scoops full of the powdered detergent into ziploc bags and keep them in my school bag. 

At 17 my mother decided to stop making the homemade detergent because we were no longer struggling to that extent and it was just one of those things that consumed too much time and there was always the convenient option of liquid detergent. For a short period of time, i stopped. No supply, no problem, right? But then i would go to my friends house montha later and one day when helping load the dishwasher i realized the packets placed inside the designated slot were granual powders. I slid one into my pocket slyly and cut it open moments later in the bathroom. It was the most delicious thing i had ever tasted. I would eat a packet every 1-3 days and would have ate more if it werent for the consistent burns in my mouth and throat. I am no longer friends with this person and have recently started purchasing my own.

 I cannot even begin to express the amount of times i have tried to stop, taken iron supplements, substituted ice chips, and even tried overeating to avoid the addiction.  If anybody else deals with this and has somehow overcome it, im begging you to please share how.

2305,f98j14,Request: (request to post) I need help making sense of whether I have a problem.,"This is long. Sorry in advance. Just trying to be as honest as I can.

I’ve been restricting my food intake over the past few weeks, pretty severely, and I’m sort of starting to feel like I can’t stop for reasons I don’t really understand.

Background: About ten years ago, in college, I got very sick and, long story short, I ended up going on what I felt was a very “clean” diet to try to fix whatever the problem was (in hindsight, probably endometriosis-related). All organic, absolutely no preservatives, artificial colors, refined sweeteners, meat that isn’t pastured raised and organic, or refined flour foods. Things got crazy and over the few years after that, I experimented with very restrictive/controlled diets ranging from paleo to food combining rules (fruit always eaten alone, etc.). Name any sort of health diet trend and I tried it. I started to become extremely fearful of foods that didn’t meet my rules, and I had more than one genuine panic attack over situations in which I was unexpectedly confront with one and expected to eat it. I didn’t know the term orthorexia at the time but looking back, I definitely was dealing with that. It was never related to my body image (although I do like the sense of control I get from knowing I can easily change my body shape), just to a desire to have the “perfect” or “best” diet possible. I had a lot of anxiety over controversial research, like I’d get really frustrated that I couldn’t find anything conclusive.

Since that time, I’ve had periods that I worried much less about my diet, but it’s never gone away completely. I learned about orthorexia and it calmed down quite a bit when I realized that it actually might have been a serious problem.

But then I had my daughter two years ago. I went through very severe postpartum depression and anxiety, which eventually manifested in a return of my orthorexic habits. Flat out restriction joined in as well, because it was convenient. At my lowest point, about a year ago, I was extremely depressed and anxious and I couldn’t eat anything I deemed unhealthy, but since I was too depressed to make “healthy” food happen, I basically just wasn’t eating. I couldn’t make myself eat “bad” foods just for the sake of getting food into my body. I lost a very significant amount of weight and I was severely, critically, underweight. I had convinced myself I just had a low appetite because of the depression, and my doctor assumed the same. My husband, therapist, and a few friends snapped me out of it and I swung the other direction, obsessively determined to get to a healthy weight. I meal planned, counted calories, ate my version of a “clean” diet, gained up to my healthiest weight ever, and thought I was better.

But now it’s happening again, and I feel like I’m lacking perspective. I’m depressed again (probably need a med adjustment), processing some very difficult trauma stuff, and I’m restricting. But it’s less health-focused this time and more like I’m scrambling for something to control. It somehow feels “good” not to eat. If I eat, I feel guilty and gross. If I feel hungry and resist, I feel like I’m in control. It feels “right” to match my physical feelings to my emotional feelings by being empty. I’m aware some weight loss is happening but I haven’t been weighing myself a ton.

This is going to sound stupid, but I’m worried I might be doing this on purpose. I’ve sort of dropped hints to a few people that I’m having some troubling thoughts/habits surrounding food, but I’ve hesitated to come right out to anyone about what’s going on because I’m afraid people will think I’m trying to get attention. And the stupid part that I’m confused about is that I’m sort of worried that maybe I am? Like if I feel compelled to tell people, if I’m sort of hoping the weight it coming off, that must mean I’m just trying to get attention. That I secretly want someone to notice. I don’t know if that thought makes any sense. When those thoughts hit, I think I just need to snap out of it and just eat and go “back to normal,” but I really don’t want to do that. It feels so much easier to just avoid eating and make that my new routine—then I don’t have to deal with the guilt from eating and the overthinking about whether something is healthy enough. But I’m scared my husband will find out and say I’m trying to get attention. We’ve only recently rebuilt the parts of our marriage that took a beating when I was at rock bottom, and I know his patience for dealing with my mental health is thin.

I feel like I could stop anytime I want, but I just don’t want to. But I don’t want my husband to find out, I don’t want to tell my best friend how bad it is because then she’s going to be texting me to get me to eat and I’ll have to eat or lie, and I don’t want to tell my therapist the whole truth because she’ll keep asking questions and I don’t think I really am able to explain why I’m doing this because I don’t really know, so I’ll end up feeling stupid and like I’m “faking” something.

Is this an eating disorder? Or am I just a piece of crap person?",1582627871,2/25/2020 4:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f98j14/request_request_to_post_i_need_help_making_sense/,4
2306,f91jz7,Request: Side effect or ED?,"I recently begun drinking Lithium (500mg) for mood and this has completely nullified my appetite to the point that I go through the day without feeling hungry. I do try to eat at least one big meal per day. 

However I have struggled with an ED (Simptoms seem similar to Atypical Anorexia) for the last 7 years on and off now. I have a need to lose weight despite feeling happy with the way my body looks, so there is a voice that keeps telling me to eat less. I don't know if this is why I don't have an appetite or if it only contributes to it? Maybe it has no effect and I am overthinking?

I have also been purging once a week which I know is a problem. I do follow my psycologist's advice but the urge is still too strong still. That paired with the lost appetite is a problem but I'm not quite sure what the main issue is or how to approach it.

2314,f8pfzu,Request: Could this be considered an ED?,"Since around 7th &amp; 8th grade (12&amp;13) I started forcing myself to restrict little by little. I can’t exactly pinpoint what made me start, but i know that i was just never comfortable or happy with my body. At the time i was a very anxious and reserved girl, so when i stopped eating breakfast and lunch @school to instead read, nobody rly bat an eye. Because nobody reached out or stopped me, i told myself what i was doing was okay, and took it to another level. I would only wear clothes that covered my entire body, and nothing formfitting-i was literally afraid of someone seeing my figure. Along with not eating breakfast nor lunch, i only allowed myself a small bowl of yogurt or toast if my parents seemed suspicious. Before i go on-i want to make it clear that i absolutely adore my family and love them more than anything, i can never blame them for this because i did everything in my power to keep it hidden. My dad was going through chemo during all of this, so a part of me wanted to feel at peace and in control of something in my life.
I wouldn’t say i recovered that summer, more like pushed it under the rug. Throughout freshmen and sophomore year though, i would constantly relapse and restrict again with any inconvenience (losing the house, a loved one, friends etc.) but this junior year (16) has been the worst so far. I’d told 1-3 friends about some struggles when they vented too, but none of the intense scenes. Recently a few weeks ago i started to force myself to vomit after any time i ate, even family parties. I hated it-i knew it was wrong-but it felt so relieving to have a “solution” when i “overate”. I only allowed this for a week before i snapped out of it. I had been doing fine this month-only the same destructive  thoughts but never taking action. But this morning i felt so disgusting and disappointed in myself for eating freely, that it took 20 minutes of internal war to make myself eat breakfast. I’m asking here because i’m honestly scared for myself sometimes, and nothings been diagnosed and i cant go to a doctor. Does this sound like an ED or am i being dramatic?",1582540736,2/24/2020 4:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f8pfzu/request_could_this_be_considered_an_ed/,4
2315,f8pfxr,"Request: Is this an ED problem? How do I cope? (TW: binging/purging, suicidal thoughts)","So this is going to be a long post, but I honestly don’t have any one else to discuss this with because I don’t know who would understand. Not sure if this the right sub for this, so please redirect me if you can! Here goes: 

For as long as I can remember (I’m 26 F), my family has made comments about my weight. It started around 13-14, when I was hitting puberty and my boobs and hips grew when I first started being teased about being fat. What started with teasing started affecting me as they would poke my fat, jiggle it, slap my bum and tell me how “jiggly” I am everywhere. Tbh I look back and don’t even think I was unhealthy or fat back then. Highschool was tough for me. I never had the confidence to speak to boys - I was tall and awkward, “fat,” had PCOS so I had extra facial hair... I never considered myself pretty. I used to compare myself to all the thin girls and never feel good enough. I never dated, I was never asked out on any. I used to write in my journal about how I wish I fell sick so I could loose weight, or about how I tried to force myself to throw up after eating. My mom actually read my journal behind my back but that’s another thing. 

Anyway - me at college: 18 years old, never been kissed, not lacking much confidence either. I was average size then. Not skinny, but definitely not obese or unhealthy in any way. I moved away for college and had a few meaningless hookups. Honestly it felt good to receive attention (which I never had), and even though sometimes I didn’t want to hookup I did it because the validation that my body was desirable felt worth it. None of those hookups obviously turned into anything more. 

I started putting on weight in college (unhealthy food, drinking ... no working out.) Let’s say freshman 15 got the best of me. By this time i thought I’d developed a thick skin to my family and it didn’t bother me + I largely lived away. 

Post college I moved back to my hometown where I started dating this wonderful man. He always made me feel loved and appreciated and worshipped my body. It felt good because this was the first time in my life that someone had seen me for me, beyond my size and weight. He motivated me to eat healthier and start working out too. I was happy until we broke up for various other reasons. 

Since then, my parents never leave an opportunity to tell me how fat I am, and how I’m never going to find a man who finds me attractive or will want to be with me. Every time I go on a date but it doesn’t work out for some reason, they tell me it’s because I’m too fat. I might be bigger than what’s considered “normal” but I’m healthy - I eat well, I work out 4-5 times a week, my body is fit and capable of doing things. But they still can’t look beyond my weight. 

I’ve also tried extremes- I’ve tried forcing myself to throw up, I’ve starved myself, I’ve binged, I’ve pushed my body to the extremes. Ive also tried hurting myself because sometimes I truly believed that no one sees beyond my weight, and that I don’t deserve to take up the space that I do. I oscillate from being strong and balanced and healthy and happy to being so low, depressed, and binge eating because I just don’t know what to do anymore. 

Every single conversation revolves around weight. I’ve been told I should stop eating while at dinner. I’ve been told I shouldn’t go out on a date with a man because he’s too thin for me and we’ll look odd as a couple. I’ve been denied dessert because “you don’t need it.” My mum has counted the number of times I ate dessert (and told me about it later). I’ve been compared endlessly to family friends, friends, other people we know and told how if they can be so skinny why can’t I. I’ve showed up at family events where they’ve remarked how my clothes would look nicer on me if I lost a little bit of weight. 

Idk man. I don’t know what to think or believe any more. I just got off the phone with my mom and it was another of those conversations that’s plunged me to feeling low again. I was so good the last 2 weeks but I can’t shake this off.

2319,f8kkyy,Request: How to deal with obsessive thoughts about food in recovery ?,"Hi everyone ! 

I had a question based on what i'm living now, after one month of true recovery (""no restriction""). In the first few weeks after i let go restriction, I experienced ""Extreme Hunger"", at this time the thought that i had previously about food were almost gone, because i was almost eating everytime, obviously gaining weight (but it was necessary, even since i was underweight a bit). But now, a month after that period of ""Extreme Hunger"" and weight gain based on water retention and anything else. Those obsessive thoughts about sugary foods are there, obviously those foods were the one that i physically and mentally restricted the most, but even in extreme hunger period, i ate an extraordinary amount of these without restriction.

During, this last week, i experienced those thoughts, and i was wondering if they were still there because there is ""restriction"" or because in recovery stage, these thoughts are normal, and will finally go out...a day... 

I was seriously in trouble and thinking about relapsing when i had those obsessive thoughts draining the energy of my mind, but now, i'm trying to get better no matter the difficulty it is. 

Has anyone experienced something similar ?

2322,f79czc,Request: bad blood test results,"I have EDNOS, with days of restricting and then a “binge” that was more “catching up on what i missed” or “enough to make dizziness/headache go away” than an actual binge. i’m also autistic with some sensory issues, which makes finding food i can get past a gag reflex even harder. making food is hell. eating is hell. thinking about what i want to eat is hell. being poor, and homeless for a period, did not help.

a year and a half ago i left my very active retail job for a call center job that I’m still at and started gaining some weight. with it paying me more, i was able to stop counting so carefully at grocery stores and stop picking and choosing what to put back and what to purchase, at least. with my funds being larger, i was able to purchase food that required minimum prep/thought; processed food, microwave meals, you get the idea. it was hard to start eating more and  restrict less especially because i knew it wasn’t That Healthy but i told myself eating something is better than eating nothing. six months in i got a blood test with my glucose and cholesterol on the higher end of normal but still fine.

a year later i’ve gained some more weight and while my dizziness is gone im still restricting, just not as badly; it’s that my lifestyle is now almost entirely sedentary. i joined the gym last month because my body dysmorphia is killing me, and the steady increase in my weight (it hasn’t yet plateau’d) is concerning me. (I’m taking a temporary break for three weeks to move and work overtime at work, but my routine is mostly cardio, legs, and core work.)

this week i got another blood test and the glucose is high enough that I’m getting another blood test to check for diabetes, and my “bad” cholesterol is high enough for my doctor to prescribe me new medication to address it.

I’m scared to eat again and have been restricting since the test; i even called out of work sick today, as my body is not handling it well. i’d only found a few things that i could make myself eat and have been living off of them for the last year and a half. i knew they weren’t healthy, but i thought i had more time to figure something out! i decided in December to move in March to allow for a lifestyle change (I was taking care of both my ex and myself; now i will just be taking care of myself, with more energy and time to devote to recovery), and started a steady work out routine last month, but this blood test has me scared bad. i don’t know what to do. i can’t go back to restricting. what can i do to assuage my fear? i have what feels like so much food in my home, and what was, before, a chore to consume but manageable, i don’t even want to touch now.",1582281696,2/21/2020 4:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f79czc/request_bad_blood_test_results/,3

2324,f7231q,Request: Relapse and I'm mad at the treatment facility I went to,"Hey there guys,
So I guess to start out: I went to treatment at The Emily Program last summer. I was there for about 4 months and when it came time for discharge I told them for a few weeks that I knew I wasn't ready to go home and nobody seemed to listen to me. Come the week of discharge, the outpatient therapist I wanted when I went back home wouldn't take me (the only ED specified therapist at the place that I go to for therapy) and so I went back to my original outpatient therapist (who admittedly knew nothing about eating disorders.) I told the treatment staff that I would relapse if I went home so soon, not ready, and with little to no support at home. They told me I needed to do DBT therapy and that's basically why they discharged me.
It took 8 weeks before I could start a DBT group and I also knew that my ED was not in check despite trying as much as I felt I could at the time. By the time a spot in the group opened up, a few days before, my grandpa died. Then the week of, my grandma was in the hospital with sepsis, needing both legs amputated, and necrotic tissue throughout her body. Needless to say I spent my time with her instead of going to group. The next week she died, so obviously I did not go to group.
I've been trying so hard to keep up with my meal plan but with all of that, plus work, plus school, it slipped and I went back to old habits. Now I'm at the point that my stomach has shrunken back up and I physically cannot get the majority if my meal plan in.
I'm more frustrated at the fact the TEP didn't teach me how to deal with a busy schedule and stick to a meal plan, and then I had this stuff with my grandparents (the stuff with my grandma is ongoing because we are taking legal action against a nursing home and now I believe a hospital as well, but not the one she spent he last days in, of course. That's a long story in itself.)
I just don't know what to do anymore and I know I need to go back to treatment but as of now I can't afford it, nor do I have the time or the ability to take the time off.
I honestly feel like an absolute failure but I'm also so mad because I feel like that maybe had they not discharged me when they did and listened to me, maybe I wouldn't be where I'm at now.
I'm trying to get extra nutrients in with Ensure and protein shakes. Liquids are a bit easier although I know I shouldn't rely on them. But my chest pains are back and my resting heart rate is back up to a very heigh number, so I'm just trying to do what I feel is feasible right now.
Can someone give me some input or kind words.. or really anything? I just don't know anymore...",1582242116,2/20/2020 17:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f7231q/request_relapse_and_im_mad_at_the_treatment/,14
2325,f6wf3h,Request: Girlfriend with ED broke up with me abruptly after 4 year happy relationship,"I've been in a relationship with a girl for over 4 years which has been really good with many happy times together, no big disagreements and us both seeing it as having found the person to spend the rest of our lives with, only a month or so ago she was asking me when I would propose to her.

She had and eating disorders prior to use being together and was recovered the time we started dating. Around 9 months ago however it recurred and things got gradually worse due to stress at work. She has been off work now around 6 months and is in treatment. Progress has been slow with some positive steps and some struggles but broadly things were stable or so I thought.

3 weeks ago she said she was having doubts about our relationship and her attraction to me. Then after a few days se arranged to meet me insisting I was somewhere around friends or family.

She then read me a letter about how she loved me but was no longer in love with me and no longer wanted to get married and have children with me. She said her feelings had been real and they had been the best 4 years of her life but I deserved someone who wasn't having doubts and declined when I offered her more time to think or a month break to think about such a big decision. I questioned whether she thought our our relationship has been a good thing and she said I had been an amazing support and said I should work on a support line one day although I probably wouldn't feel like it now. 

She had said things before along the lines of I deserved better than her and that she thinks she tricked me when we met into thinking she was normal. I insisted that I loved her and nobody is without their problems. In spite of her illness we have always had a good time when we are together.

I showed her cards she had written to me about how happy she was and us spending our future together to try to remind her of who she was but she said that she had changed. When asked if she had been having doubts for a while she said no, but she just knew that she needed to be on her own right now.

She did all she could to make things final, and changed her social media pictures on that day and insisted I tell my family. She said I should not contact her as it would be too hard for me and so I can heal and go through the stages then she would love to have me as a friend. She told me not to wait for her.

I couldn't get through to her when I said she was trying to push me away, I have read similar accounts online and about people with ED being consumed by guilt of what they are putting their partner through. I did tell her all the good times outweighed the difficult times but I couldn't get through and her mind was made up.

I have given it two weeks since then and not been in touch with her. Have heard a little from her family and it seems her behaviour is very erratic at the moment, like she is a different person and she has also barely been I touch with her sister who she is normally very close with. Her mum and friends have been with her though so I hope she is okay.

I am unsure where things stand for us now and whether she will regret this decision sooner or later. I really love this girl and want our relationship to work but I would have to be sure this couldn't happen again as this break up has been heartbreaking for me.

Would appreciate any advice, as much as I want to contact her I feel like this would be a bad move if the ED voice is still very strongly controlling her and I don't know if I could get through to her if it is.",1582219707,2/20/2020 11:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f6wf3h/request_girlfriend_with_ed_broke_up_with_me/,11

2335,fbcbi6,"Request: What I thought I defeated months ago, is coming back for round two... and I don’t know what to do.","I have been doing so well.  For the first time in my life I was happy with my body, treating it well, eating right, exercising at a healthy rate—I was even comfortable enough to give others advice and speak from my own experiences. 

Yesterday started off as a normal day. I went to class, came home, fixed a small plate of leftovers while I did hw, then later went and grabbed a drink with my boyfriend. Things were fine, we both had just one drink then I dropped him off at home. Now a bit hungry, since all I had was that conservative plate of leftovers, I decided to grab a protein burger from in n out (I was doing just fine). I was sitting in the drive thru when my bf texted asking if I wanted to come over and make mojitos. I was super down, and went to go buy mint leaves. In the checkout line, I decided I was going to get a treat- so I grabbed the goldfish explosion bag. 

At his house I sat on the couch watching him finish his round in apex, while I mindlessly ate the goldfish (everything is still fine). He finished his game, we made our drinks, and drank them while we watched a couple episodes of the office and then a movie. I left, went home and kind of had the munchies (again, everything was still totally fine). 

Coming home hungry after drinking is nothing out of the ordinary, and I usually get a small snack, a water bottle, then head up to bed. But this time, I rummaged through the freezer and found a bag of TJs orange chicken- so I thought what the hell, why not. I made the chicken, ate about half the bag, and *thats* when that long forgotten guilt sank in. I flipped over the empty bag that contained the frozen chicken pieces and looked at the nutrition facts, I was pretty disappointed in myself for losing control. Within a matter of minutes, I dumped the remainder into a container, cleaned up, and was in bed sulking about what I just did. 

This morning I, of course, woke up hungry and what did I do?? I pull out the left over chicken and rice and munch away. I ate the entire 5 full servings. It was basically a binge, something I haven’t done in months. I completely zoned out and essentially dissociated while shoving my face with forkful after forkful of chicken and rice. 

I am so incredibly disappointed in myself 1) for letting that happen, and 2) for having these thoughts that I was confident I had defeated. I don’t want this “incident” to become the catalyst for another hell of a downward spiral, but with the mentality I currently have, I feel as though it’s only inevitable. 

I guess I just need advice, and/or reassurance that one “slip up” doesn’t mean anything- or to be told by someone other than whatever’s left of my “sane self” that this isn’t even a slip up, I was just hungry so I ate.",1582981947,2/29/2020 7:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fbcbi6/request_what_i_thought_i_defeated_months_ago_is/,5

I haven't told anyone and I even justify it in my own mind... My eating disorder has been back for a few years. I have had anorexia/bulimic issues for 30 years - laxative abuse.

This time it started getting bad when I started my horrible separation from my ex husband. I am one of those people that gets very nauseous when stressed. So I lost a ton of weight. 5 ft 9, ended up around xxx lbs (Underwieght BMI) . I'm 44 years old.

I started getting addicted to being really skinny again and found something I could control. Here I am 3 years into the separation (not an easy separation, happy I left, still no agreement) I'm abusing laxatives again.. I panic when I get down to 10 pills left... I know my ed is a control issue and years of self hate. I hide it very well.

2343,faa2n1,Request: request - Is/was anyone else like me?," As soon as I wake up I have to step on the scale or else I can't function. I weigh myself after waking up, before I go to sleep and at least 3 more times during the day. I'm by no means anorexic nor fat, I'm actually very healthy and do martial arts competitively. In the last 5 months I've lost 10kg just by exercising. No one is forcing me lose or gain weight, but I feel so stressed out if I can't weight myself. I'm currently moving to another apartment and my scale is already there so I can't weigh myself tonight and it's making me crazy, I feel so fat even though I know it's not possible that I gained significant amount of weight in the last 10 hours ( before going to sleep I always list all the things I ate that day and the amount of it). Looking at my ribs makes me feel great about myself, the more they protrude, the better. Idk how to distract myself from my obsession with weight/food/calories. It's what I think most of the day and literally can't stop.

Also, I eat a lot since I do sports and I'm not bulimic but I feel so guilty when I eat.",1582798830,2/27/2020 4:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/faa2n1/request_request_iswas_anyone_else_like_me/,1
2344,faa2ke,Request: Is something wrong with me? Do men get eating disorders?,"My mother and my female friend are concerned about me but i think I'm improving my life, I'm just trying to lose weight. I know it is maybe a little extreme but I am finally motivated to change.

I am a straight male in my 20s... never heard of someone like me getting an eating disorder ever, so it must be extremely rare and I probably don't have one.

I hate my body due to my weight (I'm obese) and 3 months ago I started a vegetable diet of a few hundred calories a day. I've now lost 60 pounds in 3 months but I'm still fat. I also did water fasting. I have developed a fear of food and I am mostly very happy about that. Mostly all I eat is fruit and vegetables and I never ever eat carbs. I tried to train myself to not want food by self harming every time I got hungry. I know that's weird but it was a good distraction. I stopped because of the comments (my arms are already scarred due to suicide attempts but new ones got questions). I exercise a lot and if i eat too much I make up for it with exercise. I exercise until I want to die for hours every day. I'm getting so much healthier and fitter even if I am overworking my muscles a bit. 

I struggle sometimes because I know I don't actually *need* to eat, it's just hunger signals/greed/habit. My body has over a hundred pounds of excess fat. As long as I get vitamins, I don't actually need food. That's why I feel guilty when I eat, I don't need it.

I'm taking amphetamine drugs to reduce hunger, I started that on the advice of a friend and I think it'll be difficult to stop them now. Happy I did it though. Looking in the mirror makes me want to die, it is so disgusting seeing all the rolls of fat and my huge stomach. I don't care what methods or how extreme it is, I just want to lose weight as quick as possible. Is that really so bad..?

I used to be thin and good looking, I dated a lot, then somehow I became an obese food addicted alcoholic shut in. I invited one of my female friends over a couple of months ago. She was shocked at my weight gain and it was incredibly embarrassing. I got drunk and tried to kiss her and she said she wasn't interested because I was so fat. The disgust in her eyes was the worst feeling.. to go from women looking at you seductively to looking at you like you're a piece of dog shit is the worst i have ever felt. I didn't eat for 3 weeks after that (water fasting). I wanted to carry on but I'm too weak and just gave in. I want to try for 6 weeks. I won't be happy until all this disgusting fat is gone from my body. 

I know my thought patterns are quite negative but overall I think it's very good that I lost weight and I'm happy with my progress. I don't think I have an eating disorder but if I do then it's a good thing. Is there anything concerning here?",1582798820,2/27/2020 4:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/faa2ke/request_is_something_wrong_with_me_do_men_get/,25
