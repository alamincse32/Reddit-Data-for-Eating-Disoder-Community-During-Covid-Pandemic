0,8wnbqe,chloe_e93,"I know exactly how you feel. Due to my ED I was forced to go to the doctor once a week for two months, that meant weekly weigh ins. Sometimes it would only be a  pound or few ounces of difference but I remember how different I felt after I got weighed. If I weighed a few ounces more I felt gross and unlike me. I know it’s not exactly the same but still. Now that I don’t have to be weighed weekly I feel so much better, like I’m not just a number. It’ll pass. Just try going for a walk to ease your mind. We’re not just numbers. ",1530917980,06-07-18 17:59,alexisvaldo,"I’m sorry you’re feeling this way.. it’s not fun to feel like you don’t belong in your own body. Its painful because you don’t want to look at yourself in photos, mirrors, on the scale, anywhere. Ultimately you have to be honest with yourself and the stage you’re currently in on your life. Just remember it’s not permanent and if you’re not happy with how things are you can change. You just have to take the first step. Don’t think about the time it will take. Just take things one day at a time and know that each day you’ll be better than the one before and closer to the finish line. ",1531542480,13-07-18 23:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,8wna6m,beluga_fail,"This sounds like emetophobia, you might want to post it over at their subreddit (/r/emetophobia). 

I definitely recommend Boost or some type of calorie-dense drink you could have that wouldn't require you have to eat a lot of times per day.",1530911064,06-07-18 16:04,1-Up-Boy,"I get boost (like insure) from my hospital for some extra calories. I too only eat one meal a day, but not for the fear of being too full, I'm just too lazy to cook lol been this way all my life and I also look anorexic, but I'm a guy and 21 :p

So yeah maybe try boost",1530908629,06-07-18 15:23,oldpaintunderthenew,"I just wanted to say that this a very valid concern and for many people a disorder or a relapse begins with a physical impairment that keeps them from eating, and after that passes, a person may find it hard to go back to normal. I've read plenty stories of people losing their appetite with a cold or not being able to eat after dental surgery/stomach bugs and falling down the rabbit hole unexpectedly. Personally when I get stressed to the point of suppressing most of my life functions (can't sleep can't eat) I *know* I'm headed for a shitty ride of 'hey you could maybe not eat for a bit longer it's not hard' then 'I've been binge eating for four hours straight and I might need to go the ER with this heart rate'.    
Don't let things get out of hand please. Even if, and especially if, you never had restrictive tendencies or body image issues in the past, you are at a risk. Best of luck to you!",1530949730,07-07-18 2:48,Eilohh,"Hello there. 
What’s boost? Is that an American thing? 
Just wondering LOL",1530938448,06-07-18 23:40,hallowedember,"It’s a smoothie chain with a lot of health-aimed options, including specifically protein boosting stuff.

2,8wn9p1,TokiKlokKokCon,"My quick token is to keep busy. I find when I'm feeling sad or hating my body, I do things to keep me moving and not thinking about food. Driving around. Going to a park. Calling up a friend and talking. Volunteering. These are all huge helps to keep me from thinking about how much I hate my body.",1530910634,06-07-18 15:57,wonderwomxn,"(Sorry in advance for a long comment. Tl;dr: Talking to someone helps. Feel free to drop me a message if you need someone to vent to.) 

You’re not alone <3 I’ve been going through a similar time right now, and it sucks because after trying so hard to recover for a good few months, it feels like the ED voice came back with a vengeance but my body’s just not doing what I want it to. Idk if that makes any sense. I know you said you want to push on, but if you have someone (family, s/o, therapist, friend) who knows about your ED, I strongly recommend talking to them. Even though you desperately want to hide it and crave the security of slipping back into old habits. Vocalizing your feelings and knowing that somebody will be looking out for you (and can even validate you in terms of helping you see how you really look) can be so powerful in giving you back some agency. 

That being said, I know that sometimes turning back towards recovery is hell. If you need someone to vent to (especially someone who can’t judge you personally or hold you accountable or whatever), please feel free to message me. I can’t promise helpful advice but sometimes it helps just to know someone out there can empathize with you. ",1530988788,07-07-18 13:39,None,">*it's really hard when it feels having a better body image means gaining weight, even though I'm at a healthy weight. It's extra hard when it feels like the only reason I'm at a healthy weight is because of my eating disorder.*

Wow, I am right there with you. I've been hovering at a borderline healthy weight, and I feel like my disordered behaviors are the only reason I'm there. I definitely agree that it's hard, especially since a little voice is convincing you that you only look good because of the disorder, but that's not true (and I'm trying to remind myself of that). I also try to remember that my body *needs* food, and that any disordered thought is just that: disordered. Gaining weight doesn't equate to a bad body, either, even though it may feel like it! 

Like someone else said, I'd definitely recommend talking to a family member, friend, or calling a previous therapist. Just having someone know what you're dealing with can be so reassuring. I know you said you've only wanted avocado toast, but maybe try and find some other recipes that sound good - if it's avocado you're craving, find some others that use it as an ingredient! I've found that I'm a lot more willing to eat if I enjoy cooking the meal.

Anyway, it's good that you know these feelings will calm down in the future. Until then, I'm definitely supporting you and empathizing. ♥",1531002392,07-07-18 17:26,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,8wiqkk,None,"That is most definitely an eating disorder. If I had to guess, it would likely be bulimia. I would recommend talking to your parents about what is going on, especially considering you said he has a past history of depression. I wish you luck.",1530877752,06-07-18 6:49,spoonsareuseless,"It does very much sound like an ED, and the thing about eating disorders are that they make you a liar. So at this point, even if he says he’s doing fine and whatnot, he’s seriously at risk. Bulimia can erode your teeth, permanently mess with your metabolism, cause your stomach to tear, and all types of other nasty stuff. Even if he doesn’t want help, he needs it. Actually, especially if he doesn’t want help. 
The best option would be to try to get him in counseling. Definitely tell your parents too, but he needs mental help from a professional.",1530884257,06-07-18 8:37,Evorum,"As a mostly recovered bulimic male, who mainly suffered from severe control issues and body dysmorphia, this sounds very similar to what I started out like.  I've also had dysthymia for as long as I can remember, with respites here and there.  I'm a rock climber btw, which can be very weight conscious as well.  I think the athletic aspect + body image problems really fueled it.  I would first attempt to get on the same page as your brother, whatever that means to you.  You need to both be open and honest with each other or getting to any further step is hard.  He needs to know that he can talk to the people he trusts and not be judged.  You probably won't be able to understand it all.  If you can get him talking about it, then it will probably become apparent to him that he wants to be rid of this vile shit.  Hope it goes well for him...8 years of straight hell wasn't fun.",1530885707,06-07-18 9:01,,,,,,,,,,,,
