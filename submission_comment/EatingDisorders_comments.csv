0,ks2vbf,EmoDoodles,"Long-term weightloss can only be maintained through permanent changes. So if if you were to lose weight by purging, as soon as you stopped you would gain it back. This is why unsustainable fad diets always fail. If you have a slow metabolism, it would be natural for you to have more weight. If you're having to fight against what's natural for you, the result will not be 'healthy' even if it brings down your BMI. You should never have to throw up or skip meals to maintain a weight that is healthy for you. As long as you're eating when you're hungry and not going overboard and eating past full (aka binging), whatever weight results from that is your healthy weight.

My therapist is aware of my habits. He never makes the whole session about it (I think he feels that would be encouraging the behavior). He just checks occasionally makes sure my health is not in an unsafe place. There was a couple times were I was feeling sick on the phone with him which I know caused him worry but other than that, we don't focus on it too much. Depression is my main issue and we stay pretty on track with that.",1610062091.0,2021-01-07 17:28:11,MysticalWateryEye,"The ""only way"" you've found is disordered eating. Low metabolism has way more options than this. If your solution to weight loss is not eating and purging when you eat, then.... i hate to tell you this, but it's probably an eating disorder. 

Your therapist will not make all sessions about your ED, you are struggling with other issues, so the therapist will probably try to have a rounded approach. Eating disorders ARE mental illnesses, you are unhappy with how you look and using very disordered and eating disorder related ways to cope. I'm not a doctor, but you do need to bring this up with a doctor. 

From there you can decide what course of treatment you want, but if you have issues it sounds like a therapist (which you have) doctor, and dietitian would be a good step forward.

Gentle reminder that therapy encompasses a lot of things, so while i was being treated for my ED, i was also being treated for my other mental illnesses, including GAD, depression, PTSD. It's important to get it all out on the table, because the way are going about weightloss can greatly affect your ability to absorb any medications you may be taking as well.",1609986916.0,2021-01-06 20:35:16,ZLCer,"What u/MysticalWateryEye and u/EmoDoodles said!

I thought the same thing, and figured that being aware of my eating and just cutting some stuff out wasn’t doing any harm, since at the time it wasn’t out of compulsion nor did it have any emotional attachment or toll. Maybe some people can do the intermittent fasting thing, but getting into a pattern of not eating/purging is gonna set you up to have problems with eating, even if you don’t know. 

Again, i fully get where you’re coming from-i was in the same place. But from experience, I’ll just say this; the brain is a muscle. The body is full of them! Once you get into the pattern of doing something, it’s hard to stop; even after you’ve reached your ‘target’ weight. I found myself unsatisfied, despite having dropped a fair amount of weight. After a few months, straying from my routine of not eating started to cause me distress where it hasn’t before. People warned me that I couldn’t just choose when to stop, but I thought that I could; initially, I didn’t have a problem. By now, I do.

I really recommend discussing it now, and being open with how it’s not compulsive, and how to you, you’re approaching it from more of a strategic point of view than a truly dysmorphic or fully altered one. I think clarifying this will help you and your therapist come up with plans that work for both of you-in the beginning, being told I had an eating disorder and had to do things differently altogether just seemed foolish to me, because I was still overweight.

I guess I wouldn’t approach it like the problem is that she is overweight, but more that you are worried about her happiness.  And you could speak about your own experience with food as a touch point, that it makes you feel badly about yourself, or upsets or worries you, so you wonder if she feels that way?  And that it’s been hard for you to manage in your own life.

If she is binge eating, there are multiple things to consider, including but not limited to:
1. Speak with her about it from a supportive, non-judgemental place. Do NOT make it about her weight, the cost of food, etc etc. Shame/guilt is one of the WORST parts of eating disorders and it may just make things worse. 
2. Does she have an underlying medical issue ie. Celiac (any malabsorption disorder), PCOS, hyperthyroidism, etc. See your doctor and ensure there is nothing else going on before self diagnosing her. 
3. Is she restricting? It may not be intentional on her end or obvious to you (if you have your own difficulty with food). Maybe she has had food insecurity in the past or perhaps has felt guilty about her eating, which can lead to mental restrictions surrounding food even if she is not physically restricting herself... What I mean by this is that feeling guilty about eating certain types of food can actually feel like restriction to the brain, even if you are eating them or eating lots of other things. 
4. If your daughter needs help/support, find a WEIGHT neutral/body positive physician, therapist, or psychiatrist that specialize in EDs. Speak with them first and ensure their views align with your daughter's and yours. Ensure they are not focused on weight, BMI, ""health"". It won't help in the long term. 

Hope this helps. Full transparency, I had an ED for 20 years. I'm now fully recovered and in the ""overweight"" BMI range. I have never felt healthier, more energetic or more happy. I have a completely normal relationship with food/body - I eat when I'm hungry, eat what I feel like (varies a lot) and stop when I'm full. I don't stress about food. I'm now a physician and I never could have got here with continuing restriction (which is the underlying cause of the majority of binges). This isn't meant to be medical advice AT ALL, just speaking from experience and it's important to point out that women with eating disorders often do not reach their potential in life and I feel SO grateful for my recovery so I can do what I love as a career and have the life I truly want.",1609989319.0,2021-01-06 21:15:19,lunatua,"You should NOT put cameras and locks up.

I can remember how it felt to be overweight and the compulsion to binge is very difficult to control at such a young age as a child’s brain is not fully developed. A professional with experience dealing with children specifically would be able to give the best steps for your daughter. I had locks put in the house but this may not be the best approach for your daughter. I know it helped me, as my father explained to me calmly and with love that it was to help me and not to punish me.

It could be BED sure but, it may be as simple as having a talk about what normal eating looks like especially since (no offense indented) that hasn’t been modeled for her. Most Americans truly don’t understand what a serving size is or how much *should* cause them to feel full or sometimes what the feelings of hunger or fullness even are. 

As a parent of 2 similarly aged girls, if I noticed this, I would personally start with a nutritionist and let them then decide if we need to pursue ED specific treatment.

I was sneaking food, because my mother had already started trying to control my weight. Every snack I’d attempt to eat would be scrutinized or shut down, so I stopped wanting people to know that I ate at all. The thought of you installing cameras or locks literally made me cry. The thought of how wrong it would make her feel for following probably very urgent-feeling urges she’s having is very upsetting. 

Your post is self critical, which is fine, but I would say one step you can take is to not criticize your daughter’s weight or make her feel guilty or wrong for being hungry or in a larger body. Also she’s a teenager! Many young women gain weight at the outset of puberty.

One of the most detrimental things for my eating disorder was my mother doing these things:

A. Making me feel wrong for having extra body fat
B. Equating happinesses with weight/size
C. Stopping me from having things I wanted. 
D. Constantly analyzing both what I was eating and the way my body looked. 

Some phrases as a 13 year old that were triggering for me “you’re really getting kind of heavy.” “That’s not something girls your size should wear” “The kitchen is closed! No more snacks!” “Why are you eating? You can’t possibly be hungry” “she can afford to eat that. You can’t”

You’re a wonderful parent for trying to understand and get ahead of this. I STRONGLY recommend the book Anti-Diet by Chrissy Harrison (for your understanding, it’s a bit dry for a 13 year old). My therapist recommended it to me. It covers a lot of things regarding weight stigma/psychological, efficacy of diets, the dangers of weight cycling vs staying heavier, etc. 

Something to remember is this. It is not morally wrong to have a larger body. It is not morally superior to have a smaller body. Trying to treat an eating disorder with “a healthy diet” or further limiting access to foods can literally just shift the type/manifestation of the disorder. 
My experience at 13 sounds very similar to your daughter’s. Shortly after the binging, I began restricting/anorexic behaviors. Since then, I’ve spent 20 years cycling between binging, anorexic, orthorexic, and bulimic behaviors. Having a young girl thinking there is something wrong with her body is a recipe for continued disordered eating.

Every young girl is bombarded with the message that she has to be thin to be worthy. Some people are genuinely just genetically larger bodied. Be one of the voices in her life to let her know that her body is fine at whatever size it is and that she should never be ashamed or guilty about her body.",1610015789.0,2021-01-07 04:36:29,r1g8tn0w,"[READ: Health At Every Size by Linda Bacon](https://lindobacon.com/health-at-every-size-book/)

Tell her she has value regardless of her outward appearance and is worthy of respect (self respect and respect from others) no matter what she looks like. 

Be careful to not indirectly or directly criticize or judge her body, your body, or others’ bodies. I internalized a lot of my mother’s comments about how she and others looked. 

Teach her about self compassion and self care. 

Focus on her strengths, like being a kind person or trying hard in school, etc 

Be honest with your struggles and work together as a team. Model the kind of thoughts and behaviors that you wish to see in her.

2,ks2udl,sa-sha-,"I hurt my back moving furniture earlier this summer after graduating college and moving back to my hometown. I went to a new doctor at the clinic I have been going to for years before I moved away for college. Instead of diagnosing me with a slipped disc or asking about my other activities she immediately brought up the fact that I had gained weight since my last visit at that clinic (four years ago when I was 18). She didn’t ask about my health or daily habits or my history of weight gain. Honestly, even after years of being mostly ‘recovered’ it really hurt. I had worked hard to maintain a steady weight throughout college and finally was at a point where I had stopped dropping and then regaining the same couple of pounds. If you feel like your current weight is impacting your health I would definitely recommend speaking with a doctor who knows how to treat people with ED’s. But you may not be in a place in your recovery to attempt weight loss in a healthy way, and it’s not worth risking relapse just because a doctor made a one size fits all recommendation that may not be helpful or healthy for you. In my opinion just telling someone with an ED (no matter how recovered they are!) to lose weight without any understanding of how that information may effect them or without any professional support is just irresponsible.

I later learned my mom had even called ahead and told the office not to say one damn thing about my weight but she kept going on about it anyway. 🙄 seriously non-specialized doctors seem to think eating disorders are only a thing if you are currently dying from them like just shut up. 

I would consider how you feel energy wise. Are you still able to do things you need to do or enjoy? If you had labs, were they normal? Are you actively dealing with any serious health conditions that have gotten worse where weight loss may be required to stay healthy? If the answers are no, then screw that doctor. It is normal to gain a little weight sometimes and you are under tons of stress so there is no issue. If you miss your workout routine then try and think of ways to be more active that you enjoy.

I gained a little extra weight at the end of college as well and spent the last year trying to lose it. I lost a little but I am not going to restrict or force myself to exercise to exhaustion just to weigh a few pounds less. It is absurd. I have been trying to focus on staying active and making nutritious food choice covering all food groups. I can’t say I’ve made any total life changes and that is fine.

Anorexia has no drug or medication to cure it, so the danger is that you get too close to the fire and will get burned again. 
Most crucial: have you clearly told your MD that you have AN in your history?  You have to be very clear about this, and very honest. If you've done that, then this doctor is extremely out of line to even suggest that you lose weight.
My guess is that they don't know your history; you have to keep in mind that all doctors *typically* see is problems with obesity. By far, that's the greater concern than being underweight.  They are used to giving people well-intentioned advice to ensure that they don't go overboard on weight gain. Trust me: YOU ARE NOT THAT PERSON! In other words, based on what you said here - you simply are not at all in danger of being overweight to the detriment of your health, but you can be certain that employing weight loss strategies would be playing Russian Roulette - and most likely, the odds would be stacked against you, I'm afraid.

First, probably best to get a new doctor if you can. It's important to have a GP who you really trust and feel comfortable with; one who is on the same page with you, and who you can make decisions with TOGETHER.

It can take time to find a good doctor that you click with. It's so beneficial for your health and so worth it.

Another thing that is very important if you don't have this already: Make sure your medical record says 'History of Anorexia Nervosa' or 'Anorexia Nervosa in Remission'.

I have had this on my chart since I fully weight restored, and have at times gained weight to the point of being overweight. I think having that on my chart, as well as having a great relationship with my GP, has meant that the topic of weight has never come up except when I've lost weight. I was able to lose weight in a healthy steady way, and only then did my doctors bring it up. They wanted to make sure I was doing it in a healthy way, if I needed support, and then congratulated me when I explained how I'd done it.

The last thing I can think of that might be helpful, is if you have a psychiatrist or therapist, it might be helpful to ask them to talk to your GP or future GP so they better understand your mental health issues (eating disorder). My GP works with my psychiatrist and I find it really helpful for them to get the full picture of my health.

I hope you find this helpful. I know that awful feeling in the pit of your stomach when a doctor says something harmful to your recovery. Sending you virtual hugs.",1610062137.0,2021-01-07 17:28:57,yellowposy2,"Was your doctor aware of your ED history?

My therapist has been really helpful in reminding me about intuitive eating and trusting my body here versus tacking onto triggers.

When I first started I remember being so confused why I should eat if I wasn’t hungry. But it does get easier. One of the difficult parts in my opinion is eating anyways. 

Personally I believe you should a see a nutritionist and everyone who is recovering should. It can help gain insight on what portion sizes and how much you need (in experience EDs can warp an idea of a proper portion). 
Another I could recommend is asking for support from family or friends. For me, having accountability helped me not slip into habits. In my opinion, the hardest part was the beginning.

10,krlixt,horsecockenergy,"You seem like a really sweet partner. I would say keep going with telling her that her body doesn’t determine her worth, which usually is the recurring idea when someone has an eating disorder. Keep telling her that it’s okay to gain weight and that it doesn’t reflect on her as a person. Don’t focus too much on her looks but more of her worth, and don’t ever mention things like “you’ve gotten thinner” OR “you’ve gotten bigger”. Remove the stigma and anticipation of food, make it not a big deal  and don’t force her. Just be casual about it, teach her subtly that food is not a big deal and is to be enjoyed without worry. 

Again, you seem like a really sweet person. Best of luck!",1609930745.0,2021-01-06 04:59:05,Babygirl_charliexxx,"From my own experience of what I needed and still sometimes need from my boyfriend is just comforting but not in an obvious way. 

I struggled quite bad through one of the UK lockdowns and the gyms were closed, my mental health just went crazy. For two weeks I was in bed constantly, not moving or eating and I’m usually ok now (my focus has turned from bad eating habits to healthy ones weightlifting at the gym). 

My boyfriend suggested doing fun things with food. Every weekend we set a weird cuisine we never tried before and made some traditional dishes from scratch. Granted sometimes they failed, but for me it was breaking that “all food is bad” mindset and we didn’t have to eat it, I was just having fun with my boyfriend. We bought matching aprons with dinosaurs on and played traditional music from the country while we cooked as well.

Instead of focusing on her being sad and struggling, try suggesting things that’ll help in an indirect way. I hope I’ve helped, i know it’s really hard, I nearly caused my relationship to end. I really hope you two don’t end up in a circle of focusing on food all the time like we did. Good luck!",1609930929.0,2021-01-06 05:02:09,Me-thinks-I,"Hey, so first thank you for asking and this is actually really really sweet of you. Because not everyone think about it and end up saying something triggering.

So onto the advices :
-At all cost, and I mean AT ALL COST, refrain from giving her appearance related compliments. I know you mean we'll but when in recovery or simply on a bad day everything can be overturned by the Ed. ""You look beautiful"" May be translated as ""You look beautiful Now, but if you put on weight you wouldn't be anymore."" it could even induce a relapse and a wish to loose weight again.
-Ask her what she needs/wants
-Let her vent, if she wants to anyways, stay open minded and listen to what she says, comfort her. This can make a huge difference
-No food rated comments either (and this on a daily basis), because once again you may mean well but it has the opposite effect. ""You eat well"" or ""You're eating mroe that is good"" can be triggering comments.

That is all I cna think about :) And once again Bravo, you are an amazing boyfriend/girlfriend. I know dealing with an Ed is hard for people around Ed sufferers but I promise it can get better. One day it will be fine :) I hope the best for the two of you and have a lovely day!",1609958850.0,2021-01-06 12:47:30,Low-Euphoric,"Hey, I’m glad you’re looking for advice from a community that has experienced it firsthand. What has personally helped me the most is my bf making it clear that he was not judging me for any of it. No matter how worried you are for her health, never try to be controlling about her issues (« you shouldn’t do this, you know it’s not good for you » etc.) Make sure she knows you’re on her side, this means asking « could you tell me how I can help you? ». Validate her struggle, by telling her you understand why she would cope this way and that you love her no matter what, and that you’re willing to do what’s necessary to support her. Like I said, the most important is to make it clear you don’t judge her, no matter how mentally unhealthy she gets; shame is one of the biggest factors in an ED, so being loving to her while she feels the worst about herself can be very healing. 

Reassure her when it gets bad that everything is temporary, and that many people who have suffered from the same problems have recovered, even after years of struggle. And that you will be holding her hand the whole time. Of course, only say those things if you mean it, because if you know you can’t handle it (which is totally understandable, it’s normal) then don’t commit like that. So if you do choose to commit, know that it won’t always be pretty and you have to learn how to be self nurturing. Also what you could do is research about her ED with her, it’ll show her you’re truly invested and have the best intentions towards her.
Hope this helps, wish you the best of luck, again thank you for taking her seriously.",1609954313.0,2021-01-06 11:31:53,jetsetfoody,"For me, it is so comforting to know my BF loves me no matter my weight fluctuations. He’s def seen me as heavier and smaller and loves me just as hard. 

I’d be careful about commenting on her eating cause it can be triggering. This really depends on the person tho. For me, I feel very self conscious to receive praise about eating or any comment about the amount I’m eating. 

Get her her safe foods. She feel loved and understood. 

I think the best time to talk about eating disorder help is when I’m at rock bottom (sitting next to a toilet/purging), experiencing chest pains, ammenhorea, or just not around food. I feel desperate to get better when I’m at rock bottom but seldomly when I’m seeing weight loss.  

I recommend expressing how scared it makes you feel to lose her but please don’t get her ultimatums to recover. EDs are an addiction/mental illness. We need support to get better.  Support her, not her illness. Ask her what you can do, what triggers her, what you can do to help her feel safe/loved. 

Also, PLEASE don’t make it about weight. EDs aren’t just about being skinny. It’s about control a lot of the time and coping. I’d steer convos away from weight =/not = worth cause that’s triggering. Nobody wants to be told they’re just doing this to be skinny or for other people.

There are so many things about me that are unattractive due to the effects of my ED and weight loss but he doesn't ""see"" all that.  He touches me and loves me in spite of all that.  So, my point here, is to touch her body\* and reassure her with physical affection (all kinds - intimate, playful, casual) that you love her.  The more normalized you can make touch feel for her, the better she will feel about herself.

\*This should obviously be done with her consent, of course.",1609969379.0,2021-01-06 15:42:59,cjx888x,"I think that a huge part of it is to help yourself learn how to adapt your language. Focus on learning how to speak about others in reference to who they are as a person, and not about their appearance. You can set the tone by not making bodies a topic of conversation, even about your own or the bodies of strangers. Talk about people as though their value isn’t attached to their body/appearance. You would be *shocked* how much of a difference it makes to be away from the toxicity of what is considered ‘normal’ to say about ourselves and other. 

If you happen to feel very motivated to compliment somebodies appearance, go for something they had control/a choice over. Tell them you like their sweet new shoes/jacket/earrings/tattoo. Tell them their hair looks really cool the way they styled it that day. Tell them you love their style. 

When you are close with your girlfriend, you can compliment her smell, tell her you love the feeling of her skin against yours, that you love the way it feels to have your arms wrapped around her, the way it feels to have her hands against your skin. To heal, we need *new* experiences to connect with so we can lessen the connection with our old, unhealthy beliefs. Giving her language that drives home how it can feel to enjoy being present in your body and connecting with someone you trust who values you. 

For me, having people try to ‘convince’ me that my body is fine, and they think I am beautiful, does absolutely nothing. Healing for me came from being physically close with people who genuinely believed in the value of my physical presence and the experience of my body in a way that was connected to intimacy, not beauty standards. 

Tldr- I think everyone should stop trying to convince their girlfriend she is hot. Instead, work to change the culture of bodies.  We don’t need people to think we are beautiful.

I used to worry about this a lot too. It's going to be different for every person with an ed and also partner-dependent. Realistically, you probably won't have the brain space to be dating until you are quite a bit into recovery. 

I've been dating about since September or so and with the two guys that I've seen for more than a date or two (the first for a month, the current one for 2 months), I told them at different times. The first was maybe 5-6 dates in and it was because we were talking about exercise and he asked why I stopped running. 

The guy I'm currently seeing I just sort of offhandedly told him because the topic was on eating snacks and things.

I had a couple boyfriends while I was really in my ed, and I usually told them very early on like a ""this is something about me"" and made it more of a thing. 

Now that I'm quite far into recovery the ed is much less a part of my identity and therefore when it comes up, it comes up but I don't try to find a perfect time.",1609944660.0,2021-01-06 08:51:00,my_arms_your__hearse,"Hey there, I'm currently dating someone with an e.d. and personally, I really appreciated it when she told me.

12,kr3msc,Kindaspia,"Everything I am saying is from my own experience. I am not a doctor, but this is what helped me.
First of all, find a doctor who is trained in treating or not worsening eating disorders. If they have that training, they usually specify that. It may also help (if you have insurance this is more plausible) to find a dietician who specializes in eating disorders. Finding the right supports is key.
The first thing I had to do was focus on my behaviors. While eating disorders are a mental illness, much of the danger of bulimia is malnourishment. Focus on reducing the use of behaviors. It is very difficult to stop immediately, but if you can, that is the best option.
Otherwise, set goals. Things like “I will do this behavior less than last week” or “ I will reach out to try to find a dietician this week.” Small, reasonable, and timely goals were key for me.
If you can’t talk with the people physically around you, finding support groups that are PRO RECOVERY would be a good next step. Or first step. Like I said, it is very difficult to work alone. Be aware that not all eating disorder support groups are pro recovery, and they will make this a lot harder. Please avoid them if possible.
Often times reducing behaviors is done while trying to challenge the negative and harmful beliefs you have about food. 
Finally, find reasons to stay motivated. Whether you want to strengthen your teeth, or feel good about your body, be able to stay in sports (if you get to a certain point you may have to quit sports), enjoy food again, help your skin, make your bowel movements regular, or even just manage you emotions better, writing down your motivators and reading them when struggling can help you resist the urge to use behaviors.
One last thing. Recovery is a process. It is never going to be perfect. It won’t be easy. That is ok; as long as you are doing your best and trying hard, you will get to the point where you don’t feel the need to hurt your body the way you do.
I hope this was helpful. Good luck. You can do this.",1609876196.0,2021-01-05 13:49:56,Zelda_is_my_homegirl,"I think trying to find a solid therapist and dietician who specializes in eating disorders is more important to recovery than a doctor.

You still need to find a doctor for your liver and other potential physical health ramifications, but for recovery seeking out mental health professionals who specialize in it are the way to go and can help you with managing body neutrality while relearning to nourish yourself. 

Also I recommend the books Anti-Diet and Intuitive Eating. Anti diet has a lot of information about the fallacies of diets and intentional weight loss and it’s really helped me out.

Is it that the providers are out of network or is a diagnoses preventing it?

You should be able to call your insurer and they can provide a list of doctors, dieticians, therapists, etc that are covered. I asked specifically for a list of covered therapists specializing in eating disorders. 

For the physical issues, yes. See a general practitioner (DO, or MD). You should tell them exactly what you’ve been going through. It can be hard to face, but specifying how often and how many years you were B/Ping, and the symptoms you’re most concerned about. Liver, stomach, etc. you can ask for a referral to a gastroenterologist. I recommend writing it all down, including any questions and taking the notes with you. If your doctor dismisses any of it, seek a new doctor. I know it’s hard to deal with finding a provider, but you need someone who’s on your side. If you tell a doctor “I’ve lost x amount of weight from B/Ping x amount of times per week for x amount of years. I’m having these symptoms” they NEED to take that at your word and treat it with seriousness regardless of how you might appear to them. 

I am NOT underweight, and at the very beginning of recovery had an endocrinologist try to offer me an appetite suppressant injection when I gained an amount of weight that I’ve fluctuated in a day. I told him it was because I was in ED recovery and I was supposed to not count calories. He got all huffy and tried to talk to me about calories in v calories out. He ended up convincing me that I needed the injections and prescribed them (I balled my eyes out but managed to not get the script filled). My therapist and dietician were outraged and immediately had me switch to a doctor that practices HAES.

She helped me find other resources I didn’t know about. Another lower cost resource for counseling is called Open Path Collective. I saw a therapist through them and she was great. The National Eating Disorders Association is another resource that helps people find providers. There are free online support groups for eating disorders too. A Google search helped me find the one I’ve participated in. I also learned of some resources by contacting providers who I knew didn’t take my insurance. They were able to provide me with some references for providers who did. I don’t think you’ve ruined your life, you’ve just learned a lot of life lessons already.

Do the tests, eating disorders can create a lot of chronic conditions unfortunately, i'm in that boat and have been for years. It's depressing, and hard and you have a lot of medical tests in front of you, but the most important part is to keep eating, they might need you to do supplements for a bit, just to make sure nutritionally you are getting everything you need. when my GP was at it's worst, i had to have so much boost, ensure etc. So i know it sucks completely, but it's better to try that (of course talk to your gastro) about it, have you had labs done recently? because it could also be a part of that.

Have you been tested for Mono as well? because that's a pain in the ass, but it could just be CFS, either caused by mono or another thing. Sorry if this is overwhelming, i'm just going through my personal shit, to kinda share and help you realize that it's a rough boat, but it's better to try to stick to recovery than to slip back because it makes everything worse. Believe me.  

It's also such a weird position to be in, so i assume you have insurance, so i HIGHLY suggest therapy during this, because ED is a mental illness and dealing with your body trolling the fuck out of you while you attempt recovery is so.... it's AGH!, you get it. It's rough, i won't sugarcoat that and i'm sorry that i sound like a broken record repeating that, i just needed that validation back then, so i'm trying to give you that. 

But eventually a combo of figuring out what you can/can't eat, what conditions you have going on, which came first this or that. It will settle, sometimes it's a nutrient deficiency, sometimes it's chronic pain/illness. Bodies are weird. 

But you never really mentioned where you are in our journey, bodies readjusting to eating can cause the hot flashes and nausea, because it takes energy to absorb things and if you are already having all these other issues on top of it, it's draining on the system.

I’m sorry to hear you’re experiencing what sounds like some painful physical symptoms. I of course can’t diagnose anyone here I’m not a professional but I have struggled with disordered eating for years and years so I know what it feels and looks like to have an ED. Disordered eating is usually not because of nausea or physical symptoms like you are describing (though I suppose everyone is different and all eating disorders are different) it sounds to me like you are not intentionally not eating because of body image issues, control issues, addiction or other typical reasons why people develop eating disorders. It seems like you have something’s else to me it doesn’t sound like an eating disorder to me. I want to be clear that I could be wrong here but in my experience what I go through having an eating disorder does not sound like what is happening here. Do you purposely not eat because you think it will help you lose weight? Do you binge eat to feel better or suppress emotions or cope with stress? Do you purge after eating, on purpose? Is there a reason behind your eating patterns (either to gain or lose weight)? do you hyper focus on one or more specific parts of your body? do you do these things because you dislike how you look or think that it will change how you look? If you answer yes to any of these you most likely have disordered eating patterns. However, the physical sicknesses that you’re experiencing seem like something else to me, if you’re asking for a yes or no, based on my experiences and people I know and how you’ve described your situation I would say no you don’t have an eating disorder, it really doesn’t sound like it. but something is clearly wrong, you’re experiencing a lot of physical symptoms that aren’t normal and you should seek a medical professional if possible. Want to once again state I could be wrong, but usually you’d know if you have an eating disorder because you do these things on purpose to try to solve issues of body image or weight.",1609745426.0,2021-01-04 01:30:26,RogShotz,"I share a lot of the aspects of what your going through.

I had struggled with some form of ED before, and had friends that have gone through things like that...I';ll just like to share a few thoughts with you. 

I totally understand how childhood issues and wanting to control your body works--I've been there myself. I would encourage her to write down her past hurts and things she struggle with, think through them, forgive those who have hurt her, and find help. Maybe having something else she could control or take care of--a pet, perhaps--could help take off some of that urge to make life workable to her mind. Let her know that her worth is not found in what she looks like, but instead, it's found in who she is. 

Another thing would be to have her eat more nutritious food. Instead of counting calories, encourage her to drink more clear water (flushes out her system and helps balance the body's functions), eat more vegetables, and maybe even have her take some multi-vitamin supplements. Do some research about ""good calories"" and ""bad calories,"" and work with her to create a diet that she likes, that would give her the nutrients she needs, and yet won't be adding too much food to her diet all at once. Tell her that having muscle weight doesn't mean she's heavy or fat--in fact, having more muscles would help you burn more fat, both in the short term and long term. Keep doing exercise and things like that! Meditation might also help. 

That's what I could think of so far--don't hesitate to reach out and ask more questions if you have any. :) Blessings!",1609783739.0,2021-01-04 12:08:59,Ceilo77,"thank you for reaching out for your friend.  have you tried asking her if she would like to do things with you as her supporter.  example, eat certain foods together, go to the store and buy things together.  sort of be like her accountability partner. but do stuff with her.  let her know that the light headed and dizziness is from not getting the proper nutrients to her brain.  it could be that her exercise is burning off more calories than her intake.  try to include multivitamin for her to help supplement what she may not be getting.",1609795420.0,2021-01-04 15:23:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

28,kpuuwm,Zelda_is_my_homegirl,"Hi! I’ve entered recovery just about 2 months ago. This mindset regarding the purpose of exercise is part of disordered habits. This is the exact problem that I, someone in the throes of their eating disorder, is dealing with currently. 
When I read your post the words I see are “My weight plays a huge factor in my happiness and I’m in danger of developing new or worsening symptoms” 

I recommend that you reach out to a therapist and/or nutritionist that works with eating disorders/intuitive eating to help you through this hurdle. I think if you try to push yourself to lose weight through exercise you will simply exacerbate symptoms. 

I’ve spent 20 years with an eating disorder. Sometimes I’d spend a year or two not worrying about what I ate. I still had a disorder lurking in the back of my mind, waiting to step in.",1609719222.0,2021-01-03 18:13:42,Garbage_Patch_Kid,"Intentional weight loss is very tricky. Especially after restricting for years. Your body is most likely still healing from being in starvation mode, and further restriction may cause it to go back into starvation mode (which slows metabolism and increases stress hormones and inflammation). I would make sure you are eating enough. More calories will help fuel your metabolism. And focus on the good things exercise and your body is accomplishing! Try not to stress about your weight, as long as your body is happy and healing that is the most important thing!",1609717433.0,2021-01-03 17:43:53,anjaliv,"Hey, I wanted to point out something in what you wrote. You mention getting active and feeling good, so why would calorie restricting would help with your goal of getting active and feeling good? Your results should be entirely based on whether or not you were able to get active and feel good in the gym. 

Either that, or I can read it this way: you mentioned that you were becoming body dysmorphic and are telling yourself you’re going to the gym to “get active and feel good” but actually you joined the gym because you’re trying to change your body, once again making the false connection of wellness/happiness to weight (ED thoughts)

I would be honest about the reason why you’re at the gym. If you’re at the gym to feel better and get active you really don’t need to restrict calories. 

If you’re at the gym because you want to control your body shape again, you really REALLY don’t need to restrict calories and actually.... i would even step back from the gym and reassess things, because this would count to me as a disordered behavior. 

If you’re honestly trying to feel good and get healthy there’s about a million ways to get healthy and feel good without a gym, especially if the gym is causing you to go back down that rabbit hole.

The main thing here is intentions.... be honest with yourself about what you’re telling yourself, sometimes we’re back in the rabbit hole before we even know it! D: the thoughts of body image will always resurface at times, especially during stressful times like the time we’re living in, but we don’t need to act on them.",1609721956.0,2021-01-03 18:59:16,None,[deleted],1609766539.0,2021-01-04 07:22:19,dancebunnyy,"Heyyy so I am a certified personal trainer/group fitness instructor studying kinesiology and psychology (grad level) also in the final stages of truly feeling recovered from my anorexia/unhealthy exercise habits. A few things I have learned that helped me that may help you: 

- strength training! Cardio isn’t always the move haha but no worries you will not become the hulk either. You can incorporate strength training in tons of fun different ways of varying intensities. From what i have learned, for your purposes, I’d think about muscular endurance! If you’re into weights, lower weights and more repetitions with a progressive increase in weight will result in building lean muscle. You can also work your muscles by doing things like cycling, swimming, yoga, resistance bands, Pilates, barre, or any activity you enjoy!! Add some incline to the treadmill even! There’s lots of training stylists not as focused on the mainstream  “burning calories” or achieving a physique but challenging your body in other ways. The key is finding an enjoyable way for you to train your muscles in a  way that helps you feel your strongest :) you’ll build lean muscle and that change in your body will be visible as you get stronger but continue to work your heart and endurance. I know that info is not much but I’d be happy to answer any questions or anything 

- I can’t offer any credible nutrition info because I have no certification or education in the field. A perspective that helped me was to not think about needing to create a calorie deficit, but rather set positively framed goals to reach. I didn’t actually track my macros or nutrients or anything, but made goals like strive to eat more protein and veggies. Protein is definitely important for muscle definition!

- a buddy :) I was lucky enough to meet my best friend (another girl in recovery) who enjoys fitness and wanted to maintain a good relationship with it. Having someone to make the workouts more fun was so much better, but she was also a super supportive person to have with me, and I was able to be there for her too. We set healthy goals and did workouts together and it was great. It was definitely much easier before covid but if you have a roommate or friend or someone who you’d like to join you maybe ask! 

- I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting recently (new year I guess lol) and I’ve been thinking back on my lowest points and how I really thought it wasn’t possible to be exactly where I am today (well almost). A healthy relationship with food and exercise is possible, and even when it didn’t seem like it I just had to keep telling myself that. Eventually it became true! You got this :)",1609722742.0,2021-01-03 19:12:22,vagga2,"1. Have a simple routine of eating. Don't worry about what the calories are (don't even look them up), but three decent meals that will be fulfilling and are relatively healthy every day at roughly the same time. Even if you're trying to lose weight, ensure you aren't hungry after meals, and if you are, eat more. Personally, I don't ever feel inclined to snack between meals, but if you do, just have a simple snack like a nut bar that has enough sugar to pick you up but still has some nutritional value. Again, calories be damned, eat enough to be fulfilling
2. Have a routine of exercising. Make it a habit to go for a walk (or whatever very light exercise you prefer) every day. Add whatever aerobic work you like at the gym, 2-3 times a week will maintain fitness and maybe lose a bit of weight, 4 or more will improve fitness and pretty much guarantee weight loss.

Pretty much just routines. As long as you are staying consistent, it's relatively easy, it's getting into good habits that's hard.

Think of it not as losing weight, but instead as improving fitness. You are trying to live a healthier lifestyle, the weight loss is just a potential by-product. Also, note that muscle is easier to gain than weight is to lose, and is a whole lot heavier. So depending on body type, you might not lose that much weight, but you'll definitely be reducing excess fat and developing more defined muscle. (If you're worried about getting too muscly- don't, if you're sticking to running and other aerobic activities, you aren't really going to hypertrophy).

Note: While I've always been underweight due to my excessive exercise, I've never suffered from an eating disorder so am probably being insensitive, so sorry if I am. This is just a general outline in accordance with what has always worked for most healthy athletes and people I've met, and has mostly worked for me, influenced by what I've been taught as a Sports Science student and what we are taught at the AIS (international level athletes get a lot of eating disorders).",1609761811.0,2021-01-04 06:03:31,valshell,"Hey! It was a tough journey for me but I think I succeeded. I started by doing simple fitness challenges like 2 week get fit or something like that. So I didn’t overexercise, didn’t feel exhausted etc. It wasn’t hard at all and I was eating everything I wanted, no restriction (And I still do) . Also, I wasn’t talking about losing weight with anyone, didn’t read about nutritional values and so on. Plus, I didn’t check any label. I had some really good results within two weeks and felt my body getting stronger. Now I still prefer sticking  to a specific routine, but with the results I had I know I can get stronger/leaner call it however you want without any restriction. Really hope it helps! :)

Also I wanna add that gym can be boring for some people and if you have time and opportunity try something fun like dancing of kickboxing (you can do it at home)!",1609788118.0,2021-01-04 13:21:58,Lilith-Rising,"While you do physically need to burn more calories than you consume to lose weight, you NEVER have to count! Establish a routine, stick to it, and reassess at regular intervals. If you are not reaching your goal make ONE adjustment and continue on your path. Take notes on what makes you feel good and what isn’t working. Try rearrangement versus restriction, you are allowing yourself anything but you may arrange the appropriate amount or timing so you feel your best! Don’t worry, you’ll never have to count calories.",1609793892.0,2021-01-04 14:58:12,edsarebs,"Well, I think it depends on what your goal is. If your goal is really just to lose weight, then yes counting calories help. However, with your history, counting doesn't seem like a good idea to me. If your goal is actually to improve in the gym and feel better like you say it is, then calorie counting absolutely isn't necessary. I don't know what you've been reading, but counting calories absolutely isn't necessary to improving your health or athletic performance.

If I were you, the first thing I would do is look at your gym routine. Have you been progressively increasing how much you're doing, or do you always do exactly the same thing? Have you been trying out new kinds of exercise? Doing both of those things can help you get results without sacrificing your mental health.

You can also look at your diet without counting calories. Changing what you eat can definitely help in the gym, but that doesn't mean just restricting. Maybe try to add in some more nutritious foods. If I were you I would look at how much protein you're consuming, and then add some more in if it's not enough.

Overall, I totally understand how you feel. I feel like we look online because we want to get better in the gym, or run faster, or become stronger, and every website and influencer says that to do any of those, we have to eat nothing but protein shakes and oatmeal and count every calorie we consume. But that's honestly not healthy for anyone, and especially not for people with eating disorders. It's very possible to become healthier and stronger and fitter without doing any of that, so please don't get discouraged :)",1609716125.0,2021-01-03 17:22:05,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

i'm not a doctor or a nutritionist, but here is something that i do that helps me: maybe make some dietary change that doesn't require calorie counting. i don't know your diet, but i'm talking about things like.. giving up or limiting soda or meat or fast food or sugar/desert items. foods you don't need to survive, but that contribute a lot of calories. it should be something you know you consume too much of + has contributed to the weight gain you mentioned. if you have multiple food items, start with just one and wait a few months and then maybe tackle another one when you feel confident/ready.

if you don't have a food item like that, then it likely means you're having issues with portion size. if that's the case, maybe try eating smaller meals, but more often?

honestly, this might be worth consulting a dietitian or nutritionist about. just try to keep in mind that successful and SUSTAINED weight loss needs to happen slowly over a long period of time. just try to make and maintain healthy food/exercise choices and stick to them. after a long while your body will settle into a set point. if it doesn't, then you should consult a doctor.",1609715766.0,2021-01-03 17:16:06,Zelda_is_my_homegirl,"Thanks for posting.

An eating disorder isn’t always not wanting to eat because you hate your body or because you want to weigh less. Yesterday I saw this comment:

Being underweight is not what constitutes an eating disorder. Starving yourself is not typical eating behaviours - therefore it is considered disordered eating. If it repeats in a cycle, it is an eating disorder. You are sick if you are starving and you need to seek help. 

So I think that maybe you should go see a therapist or a doctor, you also mentioned that you suffer from depression. So maybe lack of motivation also has something to do with it. I don’t really know a lot about depression so I can’t really help you with that but I hope this helped en you get better soon! xx",1609714945.0,2021-01-03 17:02:25,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

You have set yourself free. You did something very difficult (going to residential) and you are currently doing something very difficult (continuing your recovery). These things are objectively difficult even with the privilege of treatment. I am happy for you.,1609707819.0,2021-01-03 15:03:39,TopNotchLoser,"I don’t understand why you’re being downvoted. If you’re an adult with a job that wouldn’t take kindly to taking time off (sometimes several months) in order to receive treatment or let say if you have low quality health insurance (or none at all) it is nearly impossible to seek help. If individuals do not have the health resources and monetary safety net that is required to engage and enter treatment, many can’t recover or fully recover on their own. Obviously there are a limited number of exceptions, but it’s highly unlikely. This is the reality. Some people literally cannot receive the professional help that is required for them to recover from their ED. 

When I was in treatment it was so fucking irritating to hear the clinicians tell me things like “your job will understand!” “you can make it work” like no. I cannot stop working and jeopardize my financial stability in order to receive treatment. No income coming in and taking on more debt? While also continuing to pay bills, rent, and basic needs? Literally impossible. My parents are dead and I have no other family to support me. No one at either facility I participated in recognized how out of touch they came across. 

The message of recovery is great and everyone deserves their health. I am 100% behind that and not negating the importance of recovering. But to downvote someone who is exasperated by this system? What the hell. Sorry this is so long, I just get heated when those who have the privilege to receive professional help look down and negate the experiences of those who do not.",1609623680.0,2021-01-02 15:41:20,jeabgrenouille,"I do not accept this. My thoughts might sound a bit harsh. I am sorry if they are. I don't know you or your situation so I might be very off here. 

If you want to recover, there is a lot that you can do for free. Tabitha Farrar's podcast and YouTube videos are free. This is a free no guide to recovery: https://sites.google.com/view/the-no-nonsense-guide/
If you don't really want to recover, no treatment facility in the world can help. If you really do, there are lots of free resources. I have also found Megsy recovery's YouTube channel to be really helpful.
Examine your social media and boot out the unhelpful people and seek people who support your recovery goals. That's free. 
If you know a type of therapy that you wish you could get, you can seek out accounts on tiktok or Instagram or blog posts about it and do some learning on your own. CBT is one that I think is helpful. 

In my experience, the biggest positive about treatment is having someone make choices for you about what and when to eat. Fortunately, there are ways to do this for free as well. If you live with someone who eats normally, you can speak with them and have them serve you or copy their portions. If you need to eat more because we often do in recovery, you can get support from others with planning extra snacks and challenging foods after meals.

Some people have commented that challenging fear foods can be costly, but again, there are lots of inexpensive choices. Some of my fear foods included ramen and mac and cheese. Those are rather cheap, and they can replace other expenses that come with maintaining our disordered eating routine, whatever those may be. 

Anyway, I am sorry if this comment is inappropriate given your situation that I know nothing about, but I wanted to leave it in case it helps someone who just needs to hear that they have the means to recover and they are not powerless or hopeless just because they cannot afford treatment.",1609630632.0,2021-01-02 17:37:12,nodaybuttoday__,"The reason you mentioned was one reason, but fatphobia was a huge reason why.

I know plenty of free resources, but none of them have had staying power, especially as I have experienced fatphobia even in recovery spaces. There is not a lot of space or understanding for people who aren’t thin and trying to recover without having weight loss pushed on us as the focus. My only “treatment” was a psychiatrist at 17, to whom I reported my symptoms of BED, exercise bulimia and restriction cycling, who told me “stand up and take off your jacket”, eyed me up and down, and prescribed prozac as an appetite suppressant. At this point in my illness I was what most people consider thin. After that was years of more illness and injury, and continued failure by fatphobic doctors and the General fatphobic world. Please, stop making recovery sound simple and easy when it is anything but for the people who aren’t already thin to begin with. We are often *prescribed* eating disorders and praised for weight loss and for “finally taking care of ourselves” while doing the same things that land thin people in the hospital. It’s an experience I have everywhere and I see now that online is no different.

I live alone, and I don’t have close people who can monitor me to eat “normally”, whatever that means. My mom is a diet addict and an exercise bulimic and the only supportive or nutrition-typical person in my immediate space is someone I see at work.

I did say that I didn't know your story. There was no way for me to know all the detail that you shared just now. I always comment with the intent of being helpful, but I recognize that what I say will not always be helpful to everyone. In the future, I'll ask questions first.

I am really upset to hear your situation and I do wish there were something I could say that would be helpful. I don't really understand where my perspective was thin privileged, but maybe you would be willing to let me know what I said that came off that way. As far as me saying recovery is simple and easy... I can see where you get that from what I said. I would clarify that I think that recovery is simple, but not easy. Not easy at all. I've been in recovery for 15 years so I certainly know it's not easy. I would argue that for a lot of us (maybe not all. I won't over generalize), it is simple in the sense that we know what we need to do to. Again, not easy by any means. If it were easy, my life would have been so different.

I know very well that eating disorders come in all sizes and I believe that everyone deserves the support they require to recover. Anyone who dismisses people based on their body size and does not treat them the same as anyone else with an ED does not understand how restriction affects the human body and surely assigns moral value to body size, but body size is not a moral thing. I agree with you 100% on that, and I can't understand why others don't agree when that is human biology at work. It isn't some unexplainable mystery. Science has explained it, and yet the advice some people are receiving is totally counterproductive. I'm sorry you have experienced that.

Anyway, I am sorry to have been unhelpful and for not seeking to understand where you were coming from with your comment. I really want you to know that I wish you well and I hope you can find some true support in your circle.",1609639950.0,2021-01-02 20:12:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I grew up believing no matter what I did or how I looked, no one could or would ever love me simply for who I was, so I got good at something I could hide from people so no one could take it away from me. I could control what I did and didn't eat (or throw up what I did), and it was the only way I coped with life. It got worse when I was dating because I believed with everything in me that once they knew the real me they'd be disgusted and my shot at being loved would once again leave me lonely, depressed...and right.

It took DECADES for me to figure this out but only because I tried to do it on my own. Once I met someone who knew everything about me, loved me anyway, and made me feel like I actually mattered and belonged, my relationship with bulimia (and depression and suicidal thoughts) started losing its grip on me. I then had to replace those thoughts and habits with new ones (which was really, really hard at first, kind of like going to a mental gym for daily workouts!), but with the help of my coach and my new and improved circle of friends to help me...I DID IT!

I was FINALLY and for the first time in my life okay with who I was -- who I am -- and able to forgive myself for not being perfect, own the fact that it wasn't my fault because I couldn't know what I wasn't taught, and finally eat without guilt or anxiety.

39,kok686,Zealousideal-Ad1615,i am going through the EXACT same issues right now. Just know you aren’t alone and it looks like this is a very common occurrence in recovery. Let’s keep pushing through! We got this .,1609539532.0,2021-01-01 16:18:52,MysticalWateryEye,"The romanticizing of our eating disorders is unfortunately not unusual, and unfortunately, because it is a mental illness, there will be days like these and it sucks. So let's realize that this will unfortunately happen from time to time until you get that ED voice quieter and quieter. 

You have to remind yourself of the negatives, the impact it has on your body, so that even if you did give back into your ED, you wouldn't be able to enjoy it, because there is nothing enjoyable about it, remember that? did you ever feel like ""ah yes! my body is perfect"" during your ED, ???? so why.... would you want to go back to that? (stuff i have to remind myself). Honest questions to continue to drill into your psyche.

Was i happy? and if i was could i actually enjoy it in the moment? instead of fanaticizing about it years later?

was i able to concentrate? 

The thoughts i have of food right now, and feeling that i'm spending too much time obsessing over / next meal/ what i just ate/ etc, any worse than when i was in the middle of my ED? and if so, when i thought about food when i had an ED was there ANY pleasure from it? or was it all just shame, guilt and fear? 

I know all of this might sound weird, but that's just some stuff you have to remind yourself, is the energy it takes from you to ""return"" to it, could be better spent towards self acceptance, or towards feeling just plain ""i'm okay"". and the ""i'm okay, not completely happy, but i'm able to not self loathe for 22 hrs of the day"" or whatever.... 

I fucked my body up each time i returned to ED, and it got me nowhere but a lot of chronic health problems and some old photos of myself where i look emotionally void. 

Then there's reminding yourself that no matter what, returning to the ED won't make you any happier, because it doesn't work that way, ED's thrive on control, misery and making you exhausted 24/7. 

I hope you continue to choose recovery, i wish you could get professional help, if you are still a student you can always try to contact the guidance counselor if possible, you shouldn't have to struggle alone, you've made SUCH improvements, and you've done so so much towards your own recovery, and that is AMAZING, can you give yourself some credit for fighting ED alone? but you don't have to be doing that alone, there's helplines, etc, and even just writing here is helping you lift some of that ED pressure.",1609539799.0,2021-01-01 16:23:19,Low-Euphoric,"Hey, I’m so glad you’re seeking help instead of just perpetuating the cycle, that means you’re trying, and it makes all the difference. You should be very proud of yourself for that taking into account what you’ve been through. 

I relate to what you say so much. From the frustration of not being able to “commit” to
old habits again, to rejecting the weight gain even though it’s better for you. The difficulty of going back to anorexia is very common. Actually after restricting for months, I started binging much more often, because my brain was trying to compensate for the restriction. It lead to purging (which I have been free of for about 5 months). I stopped binging when I stopped trying to stop binging, and it took a while but I got where I am now, so I know it was necessary for me to gain weight in order to understand that I don’t need to find myself beautiful to love myself. This is the most important thing I’ve learned by far this year; because of my low self esteem I probably won’t find myself attractive, but that shouldn’t stop me from caring for myself because I am more than my looks. Maybe this applies to you too? Sending you a lot of love your way, you are worthy of it whether you believe it or not, I wish you the best on your path to recovery.

I understand how you are feeling, and in a similar position.

Firstly I think it is brilliant that you recognise that you want to relapse and are struggling and that you're talking about it here - accountability is so important and I'm proud of you! And I'm sorry that your family is unsupportive, but we are here for you!

This disorder will always romanticise being unwell, convince you that you looked better, you felt better, you were more in control.

You've said that you used to excersie until you felt like death and how you shudder to think about it now. Cling onto that feeling  - that is the reality of relapse. 

You say that you feel like a failure for not being able to engage in old habits but I see that as the complete opposite - despite how you feel about yourself, and what ana is telling you, your strength to recover is stronger. Don't let ana tell you that is a sign of weakness it's shows an amazing amount of strength

In no way am I saying that is just as easy to think how bad you felt and carry on, and I understand that parts of your actions won't be in control. It's totally okay to struggle, to battle with these difficult and conflicting feelings, to prefer how you used to look and to take a few steps back in recovery. The important thing is that you keep picking yourself back up and try aim for recovery, keep talking about your struggles and celebrate every victory, no matter how small

I believe in you, and believe that you can recover! I promise you that all this hard work will be worth it 💖",1609545630.0,2021-01-01 18:00:30,godofsweetpotato,"There is no solution - I've had ED for ten years now and I never feel like I'm ever back to my 17 year old self, pre-ED. The good news though is that you don't have to be back to yourself pre-ED. You can be an even better version of every version of yourself so far.

That being said, you have to tough it through and eat healthier for yourself. It's SO tempting to relapse because that's what you're comfortable with but you know it isn't good for yourself at all! Don't seek to go back, please. Find a more comfortable eating method if that helps instead.

You are accepted and OK no matter your weight. You just have to learn to accept yourself. Very difficult process, but you have to. The only way through this is YOU! You can do it.

I know it’s not healthy and I don’t want to go back to having a full blow eating disorder but I’ve gained a TON of weight since I recovered and I miss my eating disorder weight. I’ve tried going back to those habits but it’ll last a few days then I go back to regular/binging. 

“Can’t commit” summed it up quite well. 

I also struggle with starting any weight loss methods due to how easily a healthy way of loosing weight will turn into an obsession and right back into a ED for me. 

Anywho, know that weight doesn’t define us. We will always want to look better and have a different weight idea in mind but weight doesn’t equal happiness.

What you said about seeing every single pound gained in your face, stomach, let’s - I see it too in mine. Especially the puffiness in your face. I literally just texted my best friend I feel like my face looks puffy. 

I’m at a healthy weight, that much I know, and I eat the three meals a day, all that. It’s a BIG deal I don’t skip meals or restrict like I used to - that’s a victory for me. 

But I feel myself relapsing more in my thoughts. And I struggle when I’m at work (I work at a coffee shop) and see a girl come in who is the “thinness” I used to be. Again, I see in my head I’m not fat by any means, nor am I even close to being fat. 

But I’ve begun to recognize my triggers are say when my old roommate would complain about her weight (who was a bit bigger than I) or my boyfriend about him eating “bad” food that day when I literally ate the same thing. 

I’m not sure if this helps, by providing personal experience, but if I may, here are some thoughts: 

Go for walks once a day, just so you feel like you’re moving around and not feeling stagnant on the couch or bed. 

As for food, know your comfort foods and which ones are fueling to your body and which feel heavy (for instance, I just truly do not enjoy pasta, whereas maybe pancakes - both carbs, mind you - make me happy). 

My bf says this mantra - “everything in moderation is good.” For literally everything in our lives. So where restricting is concerned, what’s helped me is when that very loud thought comes through my head that I should restrict, I say to myself that mantra, and then decide if it’ll make me feel nourished. 

If I’m deeply craving something, I’ll get it. If I’m craving something but I’ve felt heavy and lethargic from the week if I haven’t eaten all the healthy foods, I decide to do something lighter feeling - again, the balance.",1610138355.0,2021-01-08 14:39:15,MysticalWateryEye,"OH! i forgot.

When you are in recovery, your body is going to be doing some funky stuff! it's just what it does, it is finally getting food again, so it retains things for awhile, before making sure it's going to be consistently receiving food and nutrients, so bloating, face puffy all normal, including some AWFUL bowel movements. 

Your body is trying to readjust, and everyone recovers differently and bodies vary, but a lot of the puffiness is finally getting nutrients and trying to send them to all the right locations, then things will eventually settle. 

But if anything is painful or unusual of course talk to a doctor! please!",1609539985.0,2021-01-01 16:26:25,khaleesijune,Love this.,1609588803.0,2021-01-02 06:00:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think it’s very good way to show you care. My advice is to inform yourself specifically on how binge eating disorders work like do your research. In my experience (I also struggle with a binge eating disorder, but recovering well) the most important factor to take into account is shame. We usually binge to numb out the shame of not being good enough , and we purge to escape the shame about having binged. What has helped tremendously is when my partner repeatedly showed me he did not feel any judgement towards me when I was binging. This means reassuring her that you think it’s okay that she is just trying to cope, that you know everyone has their own struggles and that the problem is not her gaining weight. This is not the problem because she is more than a body. What’s inside is more important and she is already enough in this aspect, she only needs the tools to see it. The problem is that it is making her unhappy. Being thin has no value if she isn’t happy, and she knows that whatever weight she reaches, it isn’t what will make her happy. Remind her she has your support, but most importantly that you don’t judge her for any of it and that you believe she can get better, even if it will take time (emphasize that it is little by little, it’s less scary that way).

I decided I wanted to recover a few months ago and started eating more. then I changed my mind but I couldn’t go back to restricting because extreme hunger had hit. I was also borderline underweight and am now at a healthy weight and I also feel that eating makes me hungrier. I can also relate to being disappointed with the scale since I’ve gained and I honestly don’t know what to do since a lot of my Ed is centered around tracking my calories and weight everyday and avoiding the scale is not an option for me. I have tons of Ed logic for myself, but for you, I have real logic. I think you should fuel your body and listen to it and give it more food if that’s what you want. a lot of people without an Ed have 3 meals and 2-4 snacks a day so what you’re eating is definitely not too much. also, if you have a history of restricting, you usually need more food than most people to repair the damage done by restricting. another bowl of cereal is definitely not excessive!

In my experience, it’s totally normal to want more food even at a regular weight because it takes time for your brain to catch up with the progress you’ve made physically. I was encouraged to honor my hunger, and let my brain and body work themselves out. Once you’ve shown your brain that food is now regularly going to be available, it should start better regulating it’s demands. 

I totally recommend reading Tabitha Farrar’s recovery book since she talks a lot about extreme hunger and how to respond. 

It’s prob be a good idea to get rid of your scale and work on stopping calorie counting, but I know how hard that is!

And yes, get rid of the scales and anything else that tells you you’re not the right size because of a number. It took me fifteen years of trial and error with recovery, but I have learned that my body will tell me when I’ve had enough, so if I want food, it’s ok, it’s healthy, acceptable, and your body will get balance back and your mind will learn to trust your body again. It sounds like your body is in a refeeding stage possibly and that could be why you’re getting hungrier even though you’re eating more. That’s a good sign your metabolism is kicking in gear.

As you get older, you will notice that people don’t care as much about how big or small certain parts of your body are. I had very small boobs until around last year, when I turned 25 and went up a whole cup size. However, I learned to love my small boobs when I had them, (even though I was even made fun of as a middle and high school) and my sometimes androgynous body (although I identify as queer and non binary but femme presenting). 

As for fear of gaining weight back, that is totally valid. However, as many will tell you the damage on your body and mind that comes with restricting is not worth it. If you haven’t seen a therapist or talked to someone about this I highly suggest you do. It is so important to eat enough and nourish your body as a teenager and still growing.

I'd say this definitely warrants a conversation with a mental health professional. Is your family aware of this? Having an honest discussion about what's going on would probably a be a good first step, if you haven't already. Together, you can seek out a professional who can help. Regardless of what your specific diagnosis is, this definitely seems within the realm of disordered.

Another good step is a school psychologist or social worker (or guidance counselor, if neither of those are available). You can set up a meeting individually at first or with your family present if they are already on board. From here, they can point you towards some resources and out of school professionals who should be able to help.

There is a slew of misinformation about weight, body image, etc that surrounds us ever day. Remember where it is coming from. The diet/fitness/beauty industry is HUGE and companies and media certainly take a lot of liberties to sell their products and services. This information trickles down into our daily dialogues. Add to that the slew of misinformation on the internet, and the ""rumors"" that are spread via word-of-mouth in school hallways and cafeterias. I know it's tough, but do your best to take your advice from trained professionals and tune out the rest of the stuff to the best of your availability. 

High school is a great time to tackle these issues. Though recovery is possible at any stage, I believe the earlier, the better. I'm 30 and wish I would have addressed some of this stuff much earlier on. You can come out on top of this, and recognizing that your eating may be a cause for concern is an amazing first step!

maybe you could try running or hiit workouts, you cant exactly target where you lose weight though :(( try eating healthy foods if you don’t already it’ll make you feel good. and of course you don’t stop growing till a few more years. my middle sisters boobs grew like two sizes when she was 22 so HAHA. try things that’ll make you feel good, maybe new clothes or a new hairstyle??",1609566026.0,2021-01-01 23:40:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm struggling with giving myself access to any food I want instead of restricting, but what the heck am I meant to do when I just can't afford what I want to eat?

My best meal tip is a slow cooker or a multicooker, if you can afford one. I've seen them going second hand at charity shops too.

Otherwise, the way I deal with it is learning the price per kilo/pound for groceries. Sausages are one of the cheapest meats here at $4/kg so I stock up on them and use them for casserole, butter chicken but with sausage, bangers and mash etc. We can get a bit tired of them, but getting tired of them is better than having nothing.

I've recently found that some of our local farm box services are actually cheaper than the major supermarkets here for a lot of fruits/vegetables. This is especially great for potatoes and onions, which are a great base or side for a lot of dishes.

44,kxl0m6,tinari07,"Your best bet is to get medical advice. From how you describe it you don't seem fixated on losing weight or your body so it may not be a mental illness (eating disorders are mental illnesses) and it's possible it could be a medical issue. Although weighing daily can be a sign idk. You also mentioned moving back with your parents so maybe stress related? I suggest seeing a Dr as this sub/Reddit might not be the best place for advice on this.

Definitely worth getting checked out by a doctor.

I'd for sure put a pause on the calisthenics for a loooooooong while. It's more important that you let your body hold onto whatever calories you can than it is for you to get your heart rate up right now. Exercise when you're starving is really, really bad for your body.

When I'm having trouble eating, I'll do a lot of liquid calories-- Ensure becomes my bff when I'm having a gastroparesis flare (it's a medical condition I have that makes me feel full too quickly). I'll also do soups, but I throw some olive oil in there to add some extra cals. Peanut butter is also a great way to get some calories without feeling full or gross too quickly. I've also found that sugar makes me hungrier, so I'll have little bits of nice chocolate candy (I like Lindt) throughout the day.

The other thing I find really helpful for appetite is CBD oil. I \*highly\* recommend it (sorry, couldn't resist, but for real, it can be a really big help). Also really good for making me hungry is a tVNS device, which also has the nice side effect of calming me down a bit (you can get one here: [https://vagus.net/shop/stimulator/comment-page-2/#comments](https://vagus.net/shop/stimulator/comment-page-2/#comments) or if that's too expensive, there are some instructions online for how to make your own with a TENS unit).

I'm an eating disorder Dietitian who works with a variety of people struggling with disordered eating. It's never easy dealing with family who may not understand your struggles, and maybe you'll find comfort in knowing nearly all my teen clients have this dilemma. It's helpful to understand that family typically has your best interest in mind, but may not have education on the topic, or the tact to be able to respond appropriately. Try to give them the benefit of the doubt.  


Don't worry about weight. I would recommend a couple strategies to begin with:

&#x200B;

* Find a support system. Whether it's here on Reddit, a virtual support group (I can give you leads if you need this), or just some understanding friends. It's extremely helpful to be open and honest about your struggles to a few people you can rely on. I've had clients share that they learned it's important not to burden people because often you find yourself connecting with non-professionals on a complicated subject. Nevertheless, people want to help and provide comfort where they can, but it doesn't necessarily need to be ED focused.
* Find a distraction method that can divert natural instinct to move towards food when you're bored or needing emotional comfort. We often use food for self-comfort because it IS temporarily comforting, but has unintended consequences and often ends up being overall more negative than helpful. Food is great, and we should find pleasure in the taste and smell of it, but it shouldn't fill a void. Some people find it helpful to take a light walk around town, read a book, play an instrument, or play a video game. When you are looking for something to binge on, identify the thought and try to divert your attention to the activities you enjoy.
* Learn intuition and mindfulness as it pertains to food and eating. If you're truly hungry, never go without food. But if you're not hungry, then food isn't a solution for the 'void' you're feeling. One very helpful tool is to use the 'Hunger Scale' where you rate your hunger/satiety on the scale prior to eating. You can find this scale with a google search :). This takes practice, but try to recognize what true hunger and satiety feel like by using that scale when looking for a meal or snack. Eat when you're hungry, but maybe consider a distraction if you're not hungry.   


I hope this helps. :)",1610687140.0,2021-01-14 23:05:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We got this, friend!",1610680194.0,2021-01-14 21:09:54,EDRD621,"Hi,

I made this account for you, and perhaps will continue to be active on here for others who may find my advice helpful. I'm an eating disorder Dietitian who works with a variety of people struggling with disordered eating. I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like you've been really struggling, but be assured that you even recognizing the problem is real strength. Everyone has to start somewhere. Connections, or lack thereof, have been particularly difficult for many people this year. So you're not alone, at all.

&#x200B;

The first thing you need to do is to be kind to yourself. You've been led astray by a number of physiological deficiencies, as well as some environmental ones. This is not entirely a conscious choice, so therefore there's zero use in beating yourself up about it.

&#x200B;

Second, food is medicine right now. It can be helpful to think of it as such, for now. The reason is because nutritional deficiencies are a major contributing factor for ED thoughts and behaviors. The typical cycle is: Diet lacking in a number of nutrients > nutritional deficiencies > 'symptoms' of nutritional deficiency that typically lead to these behaviors like constant thoughts about food and weight, some loss of problem solving or brain fog, and various physical symptoms. It's a viscous cycle that you must break.

I'd recommend seeing a dietitian who can help you navigate introduction of foods in a controlled manner. Many of my clients find extreme comfort in giving 'control' up to a professional like myself, at least in some regard.  Dietitians are covered by most major insurances for ED coverage.

For the sake of the post, I'd recommend the first step to be is gaining some structure over your eating patterns. Schedule a breakfast, lunch, and dinner. That is it. Eat something, regularly, at specific times that work for you. 8am, 12pm, 5pm. That's where I would start if your fasting is at a level you suggest it is. Right now it's also beneficial to disregard the scale, I'd recommend placing it in a spot that isn't easy to access. Self-image and those ED thoughts are difficult to self-manage, so finding a therapist is also highly recommended.

Start there, plan to eat 3 times a day at least. It's scheduled and it's medication, for now. You need to correct nutritional deficiencies and take your health back.",1610686005.0,2021-01-14 22:46:45,midnightsy,"I wanna start by saying...

There was a video I saw of a man who was really into lifting. He looked incredible, textbook chiseled body, hard as a rock but still lean. Very handsome. 

He was explaining how, based on how they measure BMI on a scale, he was classified as obese. Textbook medical definition of obese. 

I was a bit taken aback as I didnt realize it, but scales are actually completely null and useless as it pertains to health. All of this mans bloodwork was standard, he didnt have any cholesterol problems, yet he was obese because of how much his dense muscle tone weighed on the scale. 

Basically, when your Dr weighs you, it's mainly for things like, anesthesia, how much you could have to put you to sleep. It really doesnt tell about your health or how you look. When that man looked in the mirror, he saw a fit, healthy person. His bloodwork showed a fit healthy person. Yet the scale says he is obese. 

What I'm getting at is that number is totally fuckin useless. Utterly and completely moot. What matters is how you feel. Eating relatively healthy, moving around moderately, and drinking water is all you need to do. The scale is obsolete. Throw it out. It is not good for you mentally. 

As for food, find things you find tasty and eat them in moderation with a standard portion size. That's all you can do.

Much easier said than done- but the journey is to understand that you don’t react this way for no reason. Maybe your brain has already dug deep trenches observing your mother, maybe your physical ailments are affecting your brain and body very directly, could be lots of other things but it’s not something you need to blame yourself for, or even give yourself a hard time for (I promise- I get the urge). For me, lately I’ve been having to do Carnation instant breakfasts when I can’t feel like I can put down food, but the trick is to give your body nutrients often enough during the day that it re learns how to produce its own hunger and desire.

If you have the money to see a dietician, I highly recommend it.",1610715267.0,2021-01-15 06:54:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the kind of moment where we need to try and utilize some coping skills to get through the moment. This can look like talking to your boyfriend if you can or any other supportive people you may have in your life. Continuing to focus on your breathing when thoughts feel overwhelming. Journal it out. Do a crossword or sudoku or something else that requires your focus. Use positive self-talk to remind yourself that you can get through this, you can tolerate this pain, etc. Do not compensate. This will on perpetuate the eating disorder cycle.

56,kxkh86,EDRD621,"Hi,

I'm an eating disorder Dietitian who works with a variety of people struggling with disordered eating. It sounds like your busy schedule is perhaps taking priority over your health, maybe by no fault of your own. Many of my clients struggling with anorexia have great difficulty fitting meals in and report symptoms similar to you. Your hair loss is of real concern to me, because this one marker I use to identify nutritional deficiencies, perhaps significant deficiencies. This can be turned around quite quickly though, yet it does take a lot of hard work. 

&#x200B;

I guess my questions would be - what foods are you eating? Are you feeling this way with all foods? u/charrrrrlatte has some great tips regarding bars and nutrition drinks. I agree.   


My first recommendation for you would simply be to schedule meals and snacks. 3 meals a day, 2 snacks a day. The difficulty with anorexia in particular, is that nutritional deficiency breeds further deficiency and you need to put an end to that cycle. If it helps, maybe just focus on eating *something*, 5 times a day. The schedule is important - so you need to plan the times that you're going to carve away to take a moment and eat. I often tell people that re-nourishing your body usually begins as if you were taking a medication. It's scheduled and you do the best you can to complete the task. Over time as you start to correct these nutritional deficiencies it becomes a lot easier to manage.   


Foods often bring back memories, or bring us to a certain time period. Was there a time period where eating wasn't difficult for you? What foods did you enjoy back then? I recall a time where I really enjoyed dunkaroos and those frosted animal crackers - and I can almost place myself in that era with just the thought it them, never mind tasting them! Try incorporating foods that you may have more positive associations with. It's important to remember that all foods can fit into a healthy diet, so there should be no shame in bringing back these foods you may enjoy the taste of.  


Nutritionally dense foods like nuts, granola bars, yogurts, cheese, trail mix, dried fruits, juices, and smoothies can be great foods to schedule. If you can drink some highly nutritious fluids/juices that is also a great strategy for re-nourishing.   


It's not uncommon to have this difficulty eating. But with a schedule and more nutritionally dense foods you'll start to find that you body's physiological mechanisms start to kick in and make it a lot easier.",1610688275.0,2021-01-14 23:24:35,charrrrrlatte,"Setting alarms can be helpful as a reminder to eat and making them non-negotiable. With such a busy job, I know people who have used bars (clif, luna, kind bars) to support them when they don't necessarily have time for a full meal. They also come in lots of different flavors so if you can find some that are tolerable, they are pretty efficient at getting the nutrients in.

If you really needs to you can also utilize supplements like Ensure or Boost.  Putting them in a smoothie with other nutrient dense foods like peanut butter can be a good way to decrease the amount of physical food that you need to intake.

These are just a few route you can go if eating enough throughout the day does not feel manageable right now.

Good luck!",1610676566.0,2021-01-14 20:09:26,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders. As a reminder, please do not make requests via the reddit chat app. We noticed that a lot of requests are made by chatting with the /u/EDPostRequests account.

Most people will probably just leave it at that. Some might pry and try and ask what is wrong or want to offer suggestions and depending on your relationship with them you can say you would rather not talk about it, it is private, or you can get more specific. People don’t need to know what is happening in your life if you don’t want them to but I think this is the easiest way to communicate that they need to shut up about it. 

Of course there is also the chance they will make some stupid remark like “I wish I had that” at which point feel free to just disagree or make a snarky comment about how great all the other side effects of this disease are. Most people aren’t stupid enough to wish an illness on themselves though unless they already have a pretty messed up relationship with weight loss. 

If you aren’t comfortable sharing any info you could just allude to the fact that “some people” wouldn’t want to hear that because they are dying of cancer or suffering a severe mental issue and you can’t usually tell who. You could make it a more general discussion about society and whatnot depending on how open minded the commenter is. They might think you are just trying to make them feel bad though, but most people would would realize this probably applies to you or someone you care about and back off.

So I contacted a nutritionist and, granted, it took me a couple of months to get back, but now I feel better than ever. And I know how it is with being judged. Before, when I ate an entire pizza, people would judge me a lot, telling me that's why I looked like that. Now, when I eat a crap ton of food, people don't say anything anymore.

The best advice I can give you is to have a really clear relationship with yourself and about what you are experiencing internally. It sounds like you do and you know this isn't how you want to feel. I wish I had better answers on how exactly to respond, but maybe try simply saying ""I've actually been sick and it isn't healthy for me! I'm working on getting healthier.""

64,kwesii,doodledoo5822,"Hey, congratulations on noticing that relapsing might be a thing that's happening. It's the noticing that I think is one of the hardest parts of preventing ED relapse. So from where I'm standing, that seems to bode really well, even if it turns out it is a relapse!

&#x200B;

I've been recovered for years but have baby relapses from time to time. But I notice them early, and it doesn't end up going anywhere too bad. And I've gotten better at noticing my ""orange flags"" that suggest that I might be about to have a baby-sized relapse. So I think it's truly amazing (and no small feat!!) that you're catching it early.

&#x200B;

One thing I've found \*incredibly\* helpful is to just tell as many people as I trust about it. My partner, my best friend, and my therapist all get to hear about it if I'm experiencing the beginning of a relapse. The first couple of times I told them, maybe they got a bit worried, but they've learned by now that all I need is for them to really just listen to me and know what I'm going through. So it might be helpful to tell your loved ones, and if you're concerned about them worrying about you, you can always preface it with ""I'm just telling you this so you know about it-- I don't need anything from you."" OR. ""I'm just telling you this so you know about it-- I just need \[insert thing that you need from them\] from you.""  


And yes, this is \*definitely\* like playing on hard mode when you don't have motivation to eat. One thing I've found helpful when I'm having trouble is prepping in advance (when possible-- this is also hard!) to have easy-to-nosh-on foods. I also keep Ensure around for times like those.

I did the online screenings and went to a few support groups. I didn’t have a diagnosis but I shared a lot of the same thoughts, fears, and behaviors with the people who did. I finally went to a therapist and she diagnosed me with OSFED- other specified feeding or eating disorder - because I didn’t meet the diagnostic criteria for a specific eating disorder, but have disordered eating that is sufficient to affect my functioning. I’ve met with her and a dietitian several times and am so glad I did. I realized I was doing worse than I allowed myself to believe and I only regret that I waited so long to get help!

I don’t want to waste a medical professional’s time with my queries if it’s not as severe as I think it might be. It has been a concern for a few years, when I was living at home my dad was very pushy about my eating and making sure I was eating enough but I’ve been out on my own for a couple of years now and without the external influence of someone else basically telling me to eat I seem to be falling back into the same routines.

67,kvq731,doodledoo5822,"Great question. When I was in eating disorder recovery, I learned that eating disorders happen at any weight. It's about the thoughts, behaviors, and the impact it has on your mind and body; not about actual weight, and not about whether you're gaining or losing weight. Even when I'm a healthy weight, if I don't eat enough food for a day, I notice the eating disorder thoughts come back; I notice the fatigue set in; I notice the self-hatred creep in. And over time, even if you are what doctors call a ""healthy weight,"" if you are keeping that healthy weight by doing unhealthy behaviors like throwing up, your body will see consequences like more brittle bones, increased chance of throat cancer, etc. that are all associated with eating disorders. So, I think it is safe to say, given what information you've offered, that you have an eating disorder. I think it's also safe to say that you would likely benefit, both in terms of life satisfaction and in terms of health/ life expectancy to find an eating disorder recovery center that jibes with you.",1610488542.0,2021-01-12 15:55:42,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

Seemingly that has been going on for a while, and it just shows what a shitty friend and person in general she really is. Nothing good would come out if the friendship continues, it’s just so toxic at this point.

You clearly stated your boundaries, like i don't see how you could have made them clearer all while giving them numerous chances, while still being supportive and reminding them ""hey number talk triggers me"". 

If you saw someone doing this to your friend would you be okay with that? and if you wouldn't then i think you know the answer. 

Ultimately we don't know all the details, but them mocking you on social media after your numerous attempts at saying ""this is triggering"", and them claiming it to be ""jealous of success"" is gross.

Why be friends with someone who only talks about weight loss and herself? You did already so well by asking her to respect your feelings about it, I think next step would be to learn the self respect to not allow mediocre people like that to steal your precious time.

She probably needs help herself, but it can’t be on you to be the one to help her when you yourself struggle with the same thing. And she doesn’t seem to recognize she has a problem which is hard. 

The only thing other than cutting her out would be to try talking to her and being direct, that you feel like all she does is talk about weight and that’s hard for you. But that really depends on whether or not you think she would be sympathetic and open to your honesty.

But from what you said, you shouldn’t feel guilty about possibly removing her from your life.

I advise this because it's both a great approach to help your son feel heard and understood without being judged, and because it'll give you more information about what exactly is going on.

Maybe talk to her about harm reduction? Ask her if she’d be willing to take multivitamins for your
peace of mind. As someone with an ED I can say that they do make a huge difference to my general health when I’m restricting. Another harm reduction technique would be to carry a chocolate bar or some fruit in your bag, if she passes out or feels faint she’ll need to increase her blood sugar level quickly.

76,kvq2uw,boiledcabbaged,"yes, i think you're slowly spiraling into an ED, as a person who starved herself for like a year on (TW // mention of calories & numbers) 300-700 calories and eventually hitting 0cal a day (basically drinking like litres of water to lose weight)

it is definitely a sign of a possible ED:
- Fear of eating in front of people
- Feeling guilty from ""eating too much"" and restricting the next day
- Afraid of gaining weight
- Obsessively checking yourself in the mirror for ""progress""

i too looked at those serverly underweight girls and told myself ""hah! i'll never be like them!"" and laughed it off but eventually i became like them, i lost so much weight that if i bend down, you can see literally my entire ribcage from the back, literally all my joints were popping out but yet, i wanted to lose more weight.

i eventually stopped on my extremely low calorie intake after realising how much fucking hair i was losing (literally a fistfull of hair just from running my fingers down my head), how lethargic i feel everyday and also how easily irritated i got with people talking to me, like literally i will get angry at them for breathing a decibel louder lol.

and also since i'm a female, i lost my period.

i also know how good it feels when you look at yourself in the mirror and your figure gets smaller and smaller and you feel lighter and lighter, but that is just a recipe for disaster because you'll want to cut your food intake even more than yesterday so you could ""keep up"" with the weight loss.. it's best if you stop yourself now before it's too late! stop looking at yourself in the mirror and start increasing your food intake day by day, maybe by adding a snack after a meal? or eat that chocolate cake or whatever cake you like OP! if anyone wants to judge ya, you say fuck em to them! its your life, your body your happiness! 

but what helped for me is to start and develop a healthy relationship with food again and also getting rid of that weighing scale, that cursed thing.. and also eating things that i like or crave then telling myself it's okay.

also you can watch Stephanie Buttermore (especially her ""All in"" videos and her instagram too! it's really inspiring) on YouTube, she too struggled with body image & the things she eat but she bounced back and found a balance between food and exercise, Stephanie really helped me a lot and i hope they can help you too even if it's just a little :)

sorry for the long and potentially triggering post, i just want to tell you that once you're in that rabbit hole... it's hard to get out and i really don't want you to fall into this hole, it's super not worth it

sending love to you, hope everything works out fine OP ❤❤❤❤❤

I finally got up the courage to talk to my counselor about it yesterday, and we're working on a treatment plan together. I'm only a day and a half in to the recovery phase and honestly I'm terrified of gaining weight (even more then I thought I would be) , and it's definitely a constant struggle with the negative thoughts. However, I know that if I keep heading down that path it will have negative effects on my overall health. I know it's going to get better, so I'm trying to stay hopeful.

80,kucpik,momunist,"Attempting to lose weight is risking relapse, regardless of whether or not you count calories. What you CAN do is try to increase your healthy habits without an expectation that they’ll lead to weight loss. If you eat more vegetables and get in more movement that you enjoy, you might lose weight and you might not, but you’ll definitely reap other health benefits so it’s still worth it.",1610292074.0,2021-01-10 09:21:14,None,"Hi, I've found that if you just eat mostly good fats, a bit of protein with every meal, veggies and fruit and increase your exercise, the weight should come off easily without calorie counting. If your metabolism is revved from daily exercise (gentle for a couple days and a little huff and puff style activity for a couple days to get the heart rate up) you should find your cravings reduce and appetite more stable and healthy. You may find you get quite hungry when you start exercise again and don't be scared - initially your body will need more food but it won't make you gain fat if it is the right foods. Your muscles will just need some good fuel to repair and refuel for the next workout. After a couple weeks or so, your appetite will lower a bit as your body gets used to using more energy expenditure. It is pretty hard to overeat on healthy foods cos of the fiber, protein and vitamins packed in which help to tell the brain it is 'satisfied' and then switches off hunger as a result.

I don't believe anyone needs to be hungry to lose weight. The right foods keep you satisfied and does most of the work for you :-) I find calorie counting stressful and anxiety inducing, too!! Exercise will help blood sugar regulation and burning calories (during and after) each session.

Listen to your body though. If you are feeling too tired to do exercise on some days, don't push it. Give your body time to adjust and go slow and gradual. Fatigue may mean you are doing too much too soon or need more healthy carbs to fuel your body, etc.

I hope this helps!! :-)",1610280218.0,2021-01-10 06:03:38,MaryContrary26,"I would not risk relapse by trying to lose weight. Instead, I would try to find ways to alleviate the stress and boredom.

However, i think if you can, try to get you and your brother to start cooking and making meals etc. Because her control is over the food in the house, especially the behaviors she exhibits while making you eat more, just to shame you for it, it's not good. Like, i am so sorry that you are both going through this. I'm hoping she honestly doesn't realize the layers and walls she's put up to validate her ED, but yeah, it happens unfortunately especially with parents with EDS. 

So i'd try to make your own meals, if you can, because this is probably the only way to help your brother see what a normalized meal/ eat/ activity is like, instead of the warped ED vision being pushed on y'all.

But again, NOT a doctor, i cannot give actual advice because we don't know the whole situation but i think taking some of that power away, and allowing yourselves the power to make your own meals will help with your brother.",1610297520.0,2021-01-10 10:52:00,Brennab333,"Hi! I’ve been in the exact same situation for most of my life! Fortunately it never affected my brother (I think due to a little bit of sexism in the back of my moms head) as she thought that women need to be skinny and perfect to be attractive. My mom prides herself on not eating like at the end of the day she’ll say “I only ate a yogurt and a banana today” and expects me to praise her and then tell her I’ve barely eaten. She would always “reward” me for not eating by telling me it was good that I hadnt eaten all day. She is also a mom that makes INSANELY large meals (especially dinner). She isn’t one to push for me to finish my plate but she’ll keep asking me over and over if I didnt like it if there’s any food left over. I developed pretty bad habits, I was over exercising, under eating and throwing up all to try to get down to a weight that would make my mom proud. The real kicker is that I’ve never been “overweight” and am a healthy weight according to my doctors! My mom frequently asks me to join these crazy starvation diets and tells me that if “we lost 20 pounds we would be smoking hot.” 

It wasn’t until a year ago when i popped blood vessels in my eye that she started realizing the effect her ed had on her and me. The white of my eye was red and brown for weeks and i finally started talking about going to a recovery clinic. I hope that it doesn’t ever get to that point for you but I think showing your mom how much this has affected you and your bother is the most important thing! My mom still refuses to acknowledge her ed and claims that she never said or did things that made me feel unhappy with myself and my weight. She did. Don’t let anyone talk you out of the way you’re feeling. You and your brothers feelings are valid. It’s amazing that you have your brother with you to get through this and I think a great thing you could do for each other is to validate each other when the other is practicing a healthy habit! Whether this be telling your brother your proud of him for eating 3 full meals that day or that your proud of him for acknowledging the fact that there is an issue! 

For me finding validation from myself and my friends was the most important thing! Once I decided I made myself proud and didn’t need to look a certain way to do that, my mom’s criticisms had less of a hold on me!

As for your moms health, i hear you! my mom is still the same. what ill do for her is make extra of what im making (if i make a smoothie i make one for my mom too and pack it up for her to bring)! its hard to help someone who doesn't want it but there are small things you can do! try not to give her acknowledgement for not eating, maybe even saying ""mom stop. you need to eat thats not healthy"" and then changing the subject!

I applaud you for your heart to help and for your bravery to ask for help. You're in a tough spot created by nothing you've done, and I see and celebrate you.

u/MysticalWateryEye and u/Brennab333 offer some solid perspectives and advice. The only thing I could add to what they've said is maybe confide in one of your mom's friends who could help your mom get some help. Is there someone you can talk to about what's going on so not everything is your responsibility? Or better yet, what would you like to see happen? How do you see the best way to help her would be? Give yourself permission to step across the parent/child line in this situation to start getting the help all of you need.

Before this relapse i would have occasional lapses mainly related to my mood and recognising it quickly (I think this was key), consciously working on increasing my food or adding back in fear foods or using supplement drinks was enough to get me back on track (I restrict mainly and overexercise at times), but unfortunately this time is different.

I'm sorry to hear that you are struggling. Well done staying strong today! I hope you are proud, I can imagine how hard it must have been.
I don't have a foolproof strategy to help when I'm spiraling with addictive behaviors, but I can get quite far by telling myself to wait x amount of time. On good days I might be able to tell myself ""I'll wait an hour, if I still want to do (insert behavior), I can still decide to do it then"". On bad days I might only be able to tell myself to wait 30 minutes, maybe 5, but seeing that I can wait 5 might make me feel strong enough to wait 10 the next time.

And it always helps me to make a commitment and telling somebody about it. My therapist, a friend, sometimes a random person on the internet. ""Hey, it's easier for me to stay strong when someone knows what I'm going through. Today I don't want to do xy. It helps me if you know."" In my experience prople are eager to help in such ways.

It's a good idea to work with a doctor who is knowledgeable about eating disorders and sensitive enough. Even better if she has a treatment team with doctor, therapist and dietitian all working together to help her make the best, healthiest choices.

She should try to focus on exercise goals that aren't related to weight.",1610159104.0,2021-01-08 20:25:04,Medical_Swimming_955,"As someone who has been in recovery for 8 years(I developed severe anorexia at age 15), I can nearly 100% guarantee you that she is NOT at place in her recovery where she has the wiggle room to lose even a few pounds. 

It's actually amazing how quickly the brain responds to the slightest manipulation of weight in somebody who has had a prolonged ED. I know that any time my weight starts to trend downwards, even by just a couple of pounds, my body responds physiologically(fatigue, increased hunger, heart palpitations). When I get low enough to a certain weight, my mind starts to go...and that's when shit hits the fan. The ED thoughts come back and it can be a STRUGGLE to get myself back on the right track. 

This isn't all to say that your girlfriend's situation is exactly like mine and that her experience with her ED is as engrained as mine, but I would HIGHLY advise that you sit down with her and express your concern. 7 months into recovery is simply way too early... If she is not seeing a counselor or therapist who specializes in ED's, I would also recommend that she should be talking to somebody.",1610159862.0,2021-01-08 20:37:42,Zelda_is_my_homegirl,"To me this is kinda like saying “my alcoholic gf wants to have a drink again? Is she recovered enough that it’s safe?”

Weight control is addicting. Especially if she hasn’t been a gym person, this might feel like a new door opening up to her eating disorder. A new opportunity to change her body. 

I would suggest you try to shift the gym and diet practices away from consoling/shaping the body. Help her work out for strong musculoskeletal system and heart. Eat food so that you feel satiated and energized. 

Intentional weight loss for an anorexic in recovery is not the best of ideas. It sounds like while she’s eating normally at this point that she’s still not over the body acceptance piece yet, which is truly the heart of the disorder.

her body is not nearly recovered enough. it's been less than a year and this us a dangerous time. i do not think it is a good idea despite the fact that for your healthy brain, numbers are a great progress tracker- for her they are not. 

you should not be out loud agreeing with her desire to lose weight as it affirms her current insecurities. the low end of healthy is not the only healthy weight or body fat percentage. she sounds to be in a healthy range at this moment and disrupting that and risking a relapse is not worth it. 

in addition, the comment ""her anorexia didn't appear as severe as it can be for some individuals,"" is irrelevant here. people of ed's die at all different weights. some people with bulimia hide it for years and die of heart failure while being at a perfectly healthy bmi, because their muscle is so damaged from their ed behaviors. 

i was in the same position your gf was in a few years ago. i started recovery and was doing great, got a boyfriend who was health conscious and treated me kindly. i expressed that i wanted to lose weight despite being a healthy weight and he loved working out with me. -- i will not continue the story or blame him because the relapse was out of his hands, but within a few months i was about 66 pounds and unable to control my bowels anymore. i was a 19 year old who could not control my ability to pee or use the restroom the other way. 

it spirals so quickly and is such a dangerous disease. it sounds like you love her very much and losing these few pounds could put her in a lot of danger. i encourage you to support her through her continued nourishment and assurance that she is worthy and valuable no matter what she weighs or her body fat percentage. none of those numbers matter to you as much as she does. make sure she remembers that and best of luck to you both on health and happiness.",1610173589.0,2021-01-09 00:26:29,None,"In my experience, anorexia and disordered eating is a lifelong addiction. Always in recovery until a crisis hits and can slip back into controlling patterns. Perhaps never as severe in the level of control but always there. I have been in relationships and married and I can honestly say that I was only ever in a relationship with my body and my disorder. Everything and everyone else were participants of my life but, sadly, it was just me and my illness primarily. Therapists could only help me to a degree and I had to take steps after YEARS of struggling, at my own pace and in my own way towards progress/recovery. And recovery was - and is - never linear. My poor husband had to be dragged through my hells and heavens but was never actually a participant in facilitating recovery cos it can only happen when a person is ready to change. I am 37 now and it all started at 14 years old. I then turned to binge and purge or overexercising...it is an illness of the mind and runs the show. It is an ADDICTION. The ED acts like a comforting best friend who lives on secrecy and denial and control. I feel so bad for every guy I was ever with because they never really had a wife or a girlfriend. An actor playing a role while the real me was hiding so much from reality.... I don't actively starve myself now but I definitely still cannot live without weighing my food and exercising.

However, I have to agree with others and say that this could put her recovery at risk. I of course don’t know her story, and everybody’s eating disorder can present different with different triggers, but pursuing weight loss, even the slightest amount, can be incredibly triggering. Even if she is okay in the beginning, she would need to be incredibly devoted to monitoring her thoughts and emotions in case she finds herself slipping into old disordered thoughts and behaviors. Losing weight is addictive. And triggers can be incredibly overwhelming- I personally can’t do certain types of exercise like running or heavy gym workouts because they almost instantly cause me to obsess about my weight and appearance, and I’ve been recovered from anorexia for 4 years. 

Like I said, I don’t know her ED personally or how she’ll react to losing weight in a “healthy” manner, but just be prepared.

It's ugly.",1610200802.0,2021-01-09 08:00:02,enord11400,"The largest risk here is of course that she will completely relapse and that risk is pretty significant. One factor is how long she was sick for both in terms of the physical and mental risks. The longer it was then the higher the risk. If she wants to lose weight to “look good” then I would say that does not sounds good. Is she in therapy right now? She probably needs to be to explore these feelings with a neutral party. Most resources you can find online suggest it takes 5-7 symptom free years to be fully recovered from an ED. That sounds long and it is. The behavior of someone with an ED can resemble that of an addict. Little things that might not have bad intentions can build up over time until you slide very far back. The thing is that there may not be much you can do about this besides tell her you love her the way she is and all you want is for her to be happy and get any support she may need. If she does not truly want to get/stay better then she won’t and the reasons someone may not want that are very personal and complex and have nothing to do with you. It’s also not totally impossible that things will be fine and she will figure out how to balance her mental health with exercise especially if that is something you do together. 

Bottom line, this probably isn’t the best idea for her to attempt but you can not stop her and should focus on being supportive.

When in doubt, consult a eating disorder specialist who, I can virtually guarantee, will say that making a conscious attempt to lose weight will not be good for her at this stage.

Additionally, exercising this much so early into recovery is generally discouraged. For many reasons, of course, both physical and mental. It can be very easy to redirect disordered thoughts into a fixation on working out and it's actually not  uncommon for people to develop a different eating disorder while recovering from their initial one.

Do not: discuss calories, weight, body fat, etc.
Do: support her, listen to her, be patient with her.

Recovery is different for everyone and it's -never- linear. There will be slip ups, there will be mini relapses, there may be major relapses. How those obstacles are handled makes all the difference in achieving her long term goals. 

Again, consult an eating disorder specialist. If she doesn't have a team she's working with, I definitely recommend finding one. Self recovery is doable, but it can be much harder, and being accountable to someone whose knowledge is limited (you - not your fault, of course) is much different than being accountable to someone who knows their s*** (doctor).",1610170453.0,2021-01-08 23:34:13,cetaceansituation,"Sorry for hijacking your comment!

It takes a long time, but taking a step back and putting it in perspective is what helps me. To look at the food on your plate and be thankful you have the ability to have it. That it will give you energy to do anything you want. I always think of children in other countries who literally would die for the food I used to throw away to pretend I’m eating. I still look in the mirror and don’t like what I see... but what reminds me it’s ok is that I am healthy and an able body. 
I am thankful for my legs that walk, and my arms and hands. And movement. No matter what size you might be, if you have a fully functioning body then you are lucky. Because some people don’t have the ability to run or jump. If you look at your body more as your vessel instead of looking at how you aesthetically perceive yourself. I mean it’s easier said than done to try to not take as many jabs at yourself. But don’t let yourself fall into the trap of an ED. It absolutely consumes you and it’s all you think about. It’s truly miserable. The most freeing day was the day I ate whatever I wanted knowing it was a healthy amount and that even if I gained 1 pound I wouldn’t die haha. To be more thankful than resentful of what you have makes it a tad easier. If possible when you are full, try saving leftovers. I actually don’t have a natural appetite anymore due to how much I destroyed my body. But everyday I wake up and think... “I’m not hungry but I know I have to eat to stay healthy”.  But if this is the beginning stages of an ED, run very very very far away. I lost so much weight in such a short amount of time and I thought I would love myself more thinner. I realized I’m still the same me. I now appreciate how I look, but even if I was a bit heavier it wouldn’t invalidate me as a person.

It’s ok. It will take time. Of course how I view it now is as someone who has recovered and not through the eyes of someone suffering. And besides recovery looks different for everyone. I think the behavioral aspect is what is important. Feeling forced to eat or not eat because of “guilt” is just as unhealthy as not eating for aesthetic purposes. Of course I view it for me as a reason to be thankful. But of course everyone does this differently. Good luck to you. It really is one step at a time. There were so many moments I would tell people I was recovered and I thought I was. I was lying to myself... again. But one day at a time truly. Please feel better.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/EatingDisorders) if you have any questions or concerns.*",1610155307.0,2021-01-08 19:21:47,EtAlbee,"I’ve been in a similar place and find myself in a similar one now. First off I wanna just put it out there - body dysmorphia is fucking cheeks, no matter what form it takes. The pressure, whether external, internal, or both, to be super muscular is no less intense or taxing than the pressure to be skinnier/smaller. I’m sorry you’re going through this, i imagine the gyms being closed and stuff has only exacerbated this issue. As someone currently struggling with it, here’s what I’d advise:

1) try and avoid triggering media or content when possible. I know it’s really tempting to go look at progress pics, body building pictures, etc.,but I’ve found that when I’m most vulnerable it only contributes to my paranoia and obsessive tendencies. There’s also nothing wrong with asking your friends to not say certain things or bring up certain topics-if it’s upsetting to hear about certain things, tell them that. You don’t owe any details as to why, and I’d like to think most people want to be respectful on some level. And if they don’t-leave the conversation. It’s not worth it.

(Id also note that this also falls under ‘knowing your triggers’, because it’s not always obvious and deeply individual. I didn’t initially see a problem w the phrase “skinny white boy”, or people talking ab actors who fall under that category, but I’ve realized it’s made me really insecure and let ppl know it makes me uncomfy w my body image and asked they not use it around me, even if it’s intended as harmless

2) Sometimes you have to consciously make the decision to sacrifice going to the gym/exercise time to do other things. This was hard for me to get over at first-at school I was spending an average 2-3 hours in the gym every day, in addition to taking classes and being in clubs. At first I avoided having “scheduling conflicts” at all costs, or put going to the gym above everything. I’d be late to club meetings, class, or even cancel/turn down plans with friends. Eventually I realized how much every other aspect of my life was falling behind my obsession w “getting fit”; one of the most useful changes I made was making a point to not say no to ‘fun things’ just because they might interfere with going to the gym. It was hard at first but by having an enjoyable alternative that distracted me from obsessing about my body, I was able to slowly get more comfortable with not going to the gym every single day and feeling guilty if I didn’t.

 3) Recognize your dysmorphic trends. I realized I had a big issue w dysmorphia when I would go to the gym one day, come back and see a body I was almost comfortable with in the mirror-miss the gym for whatever reason the next, and find that somehow, half my muscle had disappeared overnight. (Spoiler alert: It hadn’t. My brain was just being a dick.) I didn’t realize how consistently this happened until I spoke w a friend who experienced the same thing. Try to remind yourself that dramatic changes don’t happen over night, and you haven’t lost everything in a matter of days.

4) Try to phase off calorie counting. I’m not saying go cold turkey-I still haven’t managed that. But if you record it somewhere physically and visibly, try to go to only keeping a mental tally, or doing it somewhere out of sight so it doesn’t hijack your thought process when you’re not intentionally looking at it. I went from having it on a white board on my desk right next to my bed, to keeping occasional notes app, to mental tally to now just a rough mental estimate. I’ve also found that once you get a little more comfortable with not tracking calories so meticulously, it can help to try and eat foods whose calories aren’t clearly defined (homemade food instead of packaged/labeled, local restaurants who don’t have nutrition facts, indefinite quantities of stuff, etc.) In the beginning this can do more harm than good-when i was still rigorously writing down calories, I found myself completely stressed out by the thought of not knowing and ended up exaggerating the number and stressing myself out more. But once you get a little more comfy with easing up on the strict calorie tracking, this can definitely help.

5) If you’re close enough with someone who feels comfortable, try to have people hold you accountable. This doesn’t have to be, “hey make me eat/stop eating”, and it doesn’t have to be too intrusive. But if you’re close enough with someone who you feel comfortable discussing this with, I’d say “hey, I’ve been kinda struggling with body image lately, do u feel comfortable w talking about that?” If they do, then I’d recommend briefly describing it, and just going from there. I found that I compulsively exercised a lot less when I knew that my family/friends knew about it and were concerned; if I was in the headspace where I said “fuck it I don’t care”, sometimes they’d remind me not to work out too hard, or my friends would invite me over to do something instead so I could be distracted. It can also help to have someone to give a realistic view on your body when dysmorphia gets bad. If you can level with someone and say- “be honest, have I gained/lost weight/muscle, or am I just dysmorphic?” It can help to try and counteract the shitty narrator that is the brain.  

Ik not everyone can do this, so holding yourself personally accountable also helps; try and schedule non exercise or weight related things you want to do to try and fill up your time more. socially, try to plan activities other than eating together-this stressed me the fuck out and kinda conditioned me to want to avoid social interaction, which sucked. It sounds dumb but also just. Coming up with ways to distract yourself and ~enrich~ in other ways if you have the time can really help. Paint something, play a video game, play with a pet, really anything can help. 

6) as for the sleep-I’ve always struggled with that too, and exercise helped me fall asleep, which became kinda problematic. I dunno if you’ve tried zzzquil but I’d give it a go, it’s non habit forming and while medication isn’t a long term answer, staying up all night wracked by anxiety and depression is really fucjing awful and takes such a toll. If that doesn’t work, I would recommend that after a certain point of laying in bed- especially if you find yourself spiraling-sometimes you just gotta get up and stop trying to fall asleep for a while. This may sound counterintuitive, but it’s actually a pretty important part of sleep hygiene; the longer you lay in bed awake, the longer your body gets used to it and stops associating bed and darkness and that whole ritual with sleep. So even though it sucks and you just want to pass out, try to get up, physically sit somewhere else other than your bed, turn on some low light, and do something else for a while. Reading, drawing, etc; ik ppl say not to use screens but if you’re looking to distract yourself honestly sometimes it’s unavoidable-just keep it at low brightness.

I hope any of this helped at all; I hope the therapy goes well and that the dysmorphia/eating disorder (because it still can be that, regardless of whether or not it looks like “”traditional”” weight loss obsession ED) stops being such a dick to you. You can do this.",1610178534.0,2021-01-09 01:48:54,Grammar-Bot-Elite,"/u/EDPostRequests, I have found an error in your post:

98,ktg3h7,LucyBlue16,I’m glad you’re going to see a therapist. Mine has been incredibly helpful. My only suggestion would be to be completely honest with yourself and with the therapist. He or she has probably heard everything imaginable and will be best able to help if he/she has all the information they need. Of course make sure you feel comfortable with this person and make sure they’re a good fit for you. But after that just be yourself and be honest. Good luck to you!,1610158217.0,2021-01-08 20:10:17,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

When we have low self-esteem, suffer from anxiety, depression, trauma, etc, so many of us feel like we're out of control. 

When we feel out of control, sometimes we cope by overeating or under-eating, overexercising or not exercising at all. However, none of these things are favorable to our health when taken to the extreme. Nor are these ""coping mechanisms"" really solving the root cause of the anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, etc. What you get is a false sense of control that is only going going to exacerbate the negative emotions you were trying to manage in the first place.

I want you to know that you CAN BE in control of your decisions regarding your mental and physical health. In fact, you're the only one who is in control. When you respect your body for the amazing vessel that it is, you take pride in properly fueling and taking care of yourself. And I promise you that at the end of the day, people who fall in love with the person who has learned to love themselves first. 

Go to therapy or a counselor and put it all on the table. This is a crucial step towards where you want be. Realize that you are one of the MILLIONS of people who are struggling with the same exact challenges and feelings...

100,l1mete,nodaybuttoday__,"Intermittent fasting is restriction. Your body can’t sustain that and as a result, it likely crash binged to the point where you were eating stuff you didn’t enjoy because your brain was searching for food. Usually it’s not craving that’s happening, but the fact that we didn’t eat enough throughout the day to satisfy our energy needs, so night hunger happens. Eating more (both in quantity and frequency) during the day will even out your energy, and eventually direct your body to a safe and sustained set point weight.",1611193951.0,2021-01-20 19:52:31,Low-Euphoric,"Hey, I was exactly where you are right now, with the intermittent fasting and all. As much as I convinced myself that IF was helping, it was only delaying the problem. What helped me the most was first facing my fear of binging; this means accepting when you binge and not trying to control it. Yes you might gain weight but that is a very small price to pay for your overall well being and quality of life. Understand that your body is trying to protect you, like the comment above said, IF is restricting, meaning your brain will want to anticipate the restriction by binging. This is because it loves you! It wants to compensate for the restriction (I know I’m repeating myself, but it took me a while to understand it). 

When you first stop restricting you will want to binge a lot because you are finally allowing what you judged yourself for for so much time, and that’s only natural. Be on your own side and try to be compassionate towards yourself <3 

Something that helps me with the body image is telling myself that I don’t need to find myself attractive in order to love my body. It took me a while to realize it but it changes everything. You are worth more than just how your body looks like, and you deserve to be taken care of, so be kind to yourself unconditionally, whether you are relapsing (which is common during recovery) or not. What also helps is being « the observer », look at your thoughts and actions from an outside point of view like « I noticed im having the thought that I should compensate for this binge »; this creates the distance you need in order to be more compassionate to yourself. 

I send you lots of love and luck, I’m glad you are reaching out. You can do this, and see this as an act of self love that you’re trying. Keep trying, you will get there no matter how long it takes.",1611200660.0,2021-01-20 21:44:20,None,"Hey there friend, 

I hear ya. I would encourage you to stick with eating when you're hungry, and stopping when you are. This simple rule works well for me--I've also experiemented with intermittent fasting before, and found it helps sometimes. Maybe do more physical exercise and drink more water, so your body would get things moving and stay healthier? I also suggest drinking some water when you want to eat and know that you aren't really hungry. Sometimes, that helps me stop eating things I know I shouldn't, or at least not eat at that time! 

Keep moving forward. You're not alone.",1611250836.0,2021-01-21 11:40:36,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders. As a reminder, please do not make requests via the reddit chat app. We noticed that a lot of requests are made by chatting with the /u/EDPostRequests account.

Different parts of my whole have needed special care at different times and it’s okay to not be able to focus on everything all at once. It doesn’t mean you’re not doing little things to benefit your overall health, but sometimes one part needs a little more love than others. For a while it was my physical health, as I became weight restored and learned to eat again. Then it was my emotional health, as I needed to deal with the feelings that the eating disorder was obstructing. During the pandemic and while trying to sort out medication I gained weight, which was hard, but I was able to reason that my priority was my mental health. I was doing what I could to take care of my mind through a lot of stress, and sure I struggled with my eating at some points, but I was able to work on my brain enough to get to a place where I could better focus on caring for all parts of me a little at a time. Maybe that doesn’t make sense to anyone outside my brain, but what I’m saying is that it’s okay to give yourself permission to care for yourself in the ways that you need to at any given time (as long as you aren’t at risk of self-harm, then maybe caring for that part of you may be ideal).",1611280961.0,2021-01-21 20:02:41,tiramisuandbooks,"omg i went through the exact same thing
however i realized the more i restrict or obsess over my body the more i want to eat/sabotage myself so instead i started focusing on other stuff like reading, journaling, working out, going on walks around the neighbourhood
i am still trying to lose weight and bc we are all very sedentary rn it’s quite hard to do so 
i kind of eat lower carb that way i get less insulin spikes and prevent binge eating
i have the exact same issue with eating after dinner and i truly believe this is the reason why i can’t seem to shed my weight off quickly 
i’m gonna try to ask myself if i’m eating bc i’m physically or emotionally hungry
try not to make a big deal out of food like you have a whole life ahead of you to eat what you want so when you restrict yourself too much you start eating things without feeling hungry bc you feel as though it’s the last time you can have that thing 
so i make sure to remind myself that i can do without certain foods and this doesn’t have to be labelled as restriction 

i feel like in recovery a people tell you to “eat what you want” but i just don’t think this is beneficial 
you should eat when you’re hungry 
stuffing yourself bc you want to eat what you want even though you’re not hungry is another form of disordered eating (i know a lot of people are gonna disagree with me but the way to heal EDs is not through EATING EVERYTHING YOU WANT this approach made me obsessed with food and caused me to binge eat)

eat when you’re hungry and stop when you’re full this is the only healthy relationship with food in my opinion

Cheap foods are not necessarily safe foods, and vice versa. Regardless as to whether you have an eating disorder or not (I can’t diagnose, obviously) I hope there’s still merit in what I have to say! I found it helpful when I first started to try eating real meals at “meal times” (I know this isn’t everybody’s goal, but it was one of mine) to have food I could grab and go because my motivation to eat never lasted long enough to cook something and honestly I just didn’t care enough about myself to do so. Even now four and a half years into recovery I still don’t love cooking for myself even though I love me way more. Having a partner around (who is an amazing cook) definitely helps that regularity for me. Initially I ate a lot of picky meals, meats and cheeses and a bread and dip because they were easy. Obviously finances can be a factor and I respect that, but in the long run I was more concerned about having a good relationship with food and my body rather than eating the cheapest food available (again, not everyone’s goal, just mine). I guess what I’m trying to say is that I also struggle with motivation in terms of food so I try to capitalize on times I am motivated to pre-make meals and freeze them, or pre-bag snacks (carrots, whatever). Also, one of the most life-changing items I got was a microwave omelet maker. I had trouble with breakfasts until I got that bad boy, but now I can have a delicious egg or breakfast sandwich in a minute! Soooo helpful for low motivation days. Egg, milk, mix, go. And cheap!",1611197649.0,2021-01-20 20:54:09,None,"I'm the same way. I absolutely despise cooking. I know all the 30 somethings and hardasses like to drone on and on (and on) about how it's a basic life skill and I get it. However, I've no fucking interest in doing anything more than tossing something in an oven and setting a timer. None.

That and I grew up very poor. I like to stretch my money where I can, and since I eat out a lot especially as a third shifter, that means I eat less. To buy the ingredients and prepare a meal that's actually healthy at home is just too much work and isn't worth it when I grab something hot and ready for the same price (or less). To me, it's sort of a win-win.

102,l16y00,lrs888,"Personally I think that can happen. Anorexia is often a product of psychological mindfucks - it gives you the illusion that there is at least one thing that you can control, that it can stop the time going by so quick, and it can also be that you want a way out of your life and the not eating gives you that in a way (not being able to think about anything but food), and there’s tons of other possible reasons one might develop anorexia. Personally I think eating disorders often do have to do with body image, but those issues are more like (extremely debilitating) symptoms from underlying psychological issues. So yes I think you can have anorexia without the body image issues, it doesn’t make your eating disorder any less valid!",1611153966.0,2021-01-20 08:46:06,kvald_lipi,"It's the same with me, I never had body image issues, but I'm still starving myself.

I came here to discuss mine but I don’t think it’s worth a new post.

I don’t remember the last time I looked at myself and felt fat. I have a smart scale which gives you a rough body composition and shows you graphs. I have no negative feelings related to using it since, again, I have no issue with my body shape. Besides it’s been only going down since I got it and started tracking, so it’s actually nice to use it. My stats are pretty neat too, I don’t really want them to change.

I have very little appetite due to being stressed and busy, but I find that even when I’m hungry and prepare a meal, I will nope out of it if I get into conflict with a family member. Like if they unfairly insult me or have an argument with each other or shout/curse for whatever reason, I will conceal the food to avoid drama and not eat for the day. Which is easy as I’m physically used to fasting etc.

I used to think it was a way of “getting back” at people close to me. But since I don’t want them to know and just leave to be alone, it’s probably a control thing. It didn’t occur to me because I generally have a good relationship with everyone, my family isn’t abusive, I don’t want their attention.

You said something very profound that stood out to me most: ""I feel like she just doesn't understand...""

You're absolutely right -- she doesn't understand! She has zero clues how you feel, but I would also bet she's struggled with some type of eating issues herself which is why she's always asking about your weight.

Years after I finally told my mom about the bulimia I'd become best friends with, she let it slip that she ""didn't want to be fat"" when she was pregnant with my sister and never ate. She kept letting me think it was my fault and like I was the only one in the world who'd ever struggled when in fact she basically started it...

...which is why she let me keep thinking it was all me. She didn't know how to help me because she had never gotten help for her own self. She felt so guilty it was SHE who couldn't tag about it because she felt like a failure as a mother. The reality of it was that she was so selfish that she couldn't see past herself to help me.

...but she didn't know any better. Since no one had helped her, she didn't know how to help me.

Knowing what I know now and what I wish I had known then is if I'd had someone to talk to I could have gotten past all the living hell so much faster.

You know how when you rip off a bandaid and you're really afraid to do it because you know it's going to sting for a minute? That's what it's like when you allow yourself to talk to that teacher you trust - it might be scary to walk through that door, but once that person knows your story and your concerns, he or she will know exactly how to help you -- with or without telling your mom.

As terrifying as it might seem, if you can take just that one step to talk to that person you trust, the next step will reveal itself once you're there. The only difference of that next step is that you won't have to take it --or any other steps -- alone ever again.

As a matter of fact, you're already not alone. I'm here for and with you.

...and I can promise you this: If I can get better and have a life I actually enjoy, I know you can too.

Your body has probably just adjusted to a new 'set point' weight. 

If your body is currently within a healthy weight range (using BMI as a guide) then it may not need to be shed by the body as 'excess'.

A few other factors can also influence/hinder weight loss like sleeping patterns, over-exercising, caffeine intake, food intolerances, medical conditions, hormone changes (what age are you now compared to when you had an ED?). Hormones change as we age, too. Seasonal changes throughout the year, lack of sunlight,  salt intake, processed foods, refined sugars, stress, etc.

Healthy weight loss just takes time. Try to focus on how much fitter you are now and nutritionally nourished. Exercising for health is so good for the brain, mood, focus and wellbeing :-)  Blood sugar levels are easily stabilised, too.

Such a huge part of getting better is having an environment that will promote that, but unfortunately having a bad environment can do just the opposite. Does your sister/family know about your struggles? If your dad does and is continuing to make those comments, that’s something he needs to immediately change. If you haven’t approached them yet, as scary as it can be, it could help you and your sister a lot. If that’s too much, maybe you can open up to your sister about your own issues with food, and that might make her more willing to open up about hers too, or at least make her feel less alone.

112,l0yqec,BrowncoatIona,"So, spoiler alert, I am slightly tipsy writing this. 

There are kind of two avenues you could take here.

One of them is to start distancing yourself, recognize her habits/disorder are unhealthy. Therapy could help with this, for sure. But any route will be challenging. 

Second, you could talk to her in a way you don't feel is ""calling her out"" too much. Perhaps bring up that neither of you seem to be the peak of ""health"" when it comes to food, and talk about how you want to do better and offer for her to join in on that effort.

It's really challenging. EDs are tough. I would say being as honest as you think you can be, but simultaneously with an ED no matter what you do there's a chance she will continue/worsen her behaviors. 

I wish you love and luck. You need to take care of yourself first and foremost before anything else.

Edit: fixed some tipsy typos",1611126675.0,2021-01-20 01:11:15,None,"I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. I’ve been here before although very slightly different. I lived with a friend for two years. During the first I was recovering from bulimia. I’d had it for around 8 years at that point and was finally at a stage where recovery was starting to work. My friend knew this and during my recovery attempts I never spoke about calories, weight etc and would tell her if some conversations were a little triggering (I understood why she spoke about them because diet culture is annoyingly prevalent!) However during our second year of living together I noticed she was excessively restriction. She was under eating, over exercising, stopped socialising, going out, weighing everything to a gram and it was incredibly triggering for me. I recovered into a non-skinny body. It’s still taking me time to accept I’m just not skinny but it was really tough to see her become smaller and smaller and I could see the warning signs because it’s exactly what I did. I tried to bring it up but she was adamant she was just being healthy. 

Like you, I knew I was eating a healthy amount but it was super hard and my ED wanted to copy her. I also knew she’d be in denial if I brought it up. Ultimately, although I had first hand experience of ED and wanted to help her and give her time, it was too difficult and it really really affected me so I had to tell her. 

I found it helpful to write down a speech of sorts so that I could read it out and express my concerns. Otherwise, I would end up waffling or going off on a tangent. I explained I was concerned for her health and that her actions were very hard for me to be around. However, I kept bringing it back to me being worried about her because I didn’t want her to be attacked. I explained that certain actions/comments were hurting me and although I wanted to help her, due to my own issues I think I needed to step back and help myself first. My therapist also suggested I move out to prioritise my recovery but we only had a couple of months left on the lease so I didn’t (also to avoid the hassle).

At the end of the day, you can’t help anyone if you are in need of support yourself (put your own mask on and whatnot) but I do think talking to her is the first step and see if she recognises she has an issue. It’ll be scary and difficult but i think it needs doing 

I hope even the smallest bit of this helps you xx",1611141963.0,2021-01-20 05:26:03,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders. As a reminder, please do not make requests via the reddit chat app. We noticed that a lot of requests are made by chatting with the /u/EDPostRequests account.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

First of all, just want to echo that this is a really tough situation and I am sorry that you are dealing with it but I think it’s really important to also realize that it’s a positive sign that you have the insight into how her behavior is affecting your relationship to food. 
I would say that even though you may be unsure if you had/have a “diagnosable” ED, one of the best tools at your disposal throughout this situation would be a therapist. I have been in this exact living situation before and being able to have someone I could go to every week and be like “AGH x,y and z is bothering me so much” was really, really helpful. And that’s what they’re there for! I realize finding a good therapist who is affordable is a bit difficult, but it’s worth at least looking. 
Also, I feel like when I was in this situation, I kept going back and forth between completely wanting to distance myself from the person and the situation for the sake of my own health/sanity and also chastising myself for letting outside factors affect my eating disorder behavior. Realistically, no one can avoid triggers completely, so I kept telling myself that it was my problem if I was letting someone else’s ED affect my own. This is probably the wrong attitude to take. Forcing yourself to grin and bear that living situation while you also realize that it’s negatively impacting you is honestly probably not going to make you any “stronger.” If putting yourself first means that you need to distance yourself from this person and living with them, then that’s okay! 
You’re probably right that bringing up your concerns to her will make her recoil, but in the past, I have said things like “I need to do X for my own health and well-being” because she may need to reach out for help on her own time, but that doesn’t preclude you from being able to voice what you need to help yourself. 
I realize I may have given a lot of sort of abstract advice, but in terms of actionable things that have helped me when I’ve been in this situation is 1) talk to my therapist a lot lol 2) try to distance myself from the person as much as possible (pandemic must make it harder and you don’t want to be holed up in your room, so I’m still going to think about ideas for this one) 3) try to spend more time around people who I know have healthy eating habits, simply because your perception of normalcy is getting super skewed. Maybe in the current pandemic situation, this could even come in the form of surrounding yourself with positive media - try to distract yourself as much as possible from thinking about food and body image by watching your favorite comedy TV show or reading an exciting book. I hope this sort of makes sense. You could also try journaling - I love to write letters to people that I never intend to send, helps me get my frustrations out without actually needing to confront someone. 
I’m sorry for such a long post, but I’m going to keep thinking about this because I have been in this situation and it’s really hard when you feel like you have no option but to stick it out and hope things get better.

114,kztzx8,Bigbootybaskett,"I’m really sorry to hear you struggling with this. With my experience, I would say yes, you do have an eating disorder, however, try not to worry about a self-diagnosis, and on repairing the food relationship instead. A medical diagnosis from a doctor can be extremely helpful to get you the right types of physiological and mental treatment, but of course doesn’t change anything about who you are. To label yourself with an eating disorder should only be used for positive reasons- like if you feel it will help to make you feel validated and safe, or that your issue can be dealt with. The self diagnosis of an ED can be dangerous though if it makes you panic, and in that case I would try to think about it less as a disorder and more that you really struggle with your relationship with food and it’s a really big challenge for you. The most IMPORTANT thing to do is to see a counselor and a nutritionist if you can. Make sure that the counselor has some background in EDs- or they will be of little use to you, someone who maybe doesn’t fully understand their situation or level of sickness.

116,kztyqh,MysticalWateryEye,"Eating disorders are a mental illness, and so getting a therapist to help you would be a good idea. If you can't afford one, there are some online services that offer cheaper plans or there are hotlines/helplines. 

Obsessive thoughts can be really hard to quiet down, because the ED voice is so dang loud. So it's good to try and have some affirmations that are nice about yourself, even if it's something simple like ""my hair looks nice today"" or "" my worth isn't my weight"", to just repeat over and over whenever the negative thoughts come back. 

It's REALLY good that you want to get better, having motivation to want too will really help in recovery! and you should be proud of yourself for wanting recovery and realizing that this voice isn't something you want constantly harassing you.

117,kztxww,Bigbootybaskett,"The best thing you can do is meet with a counselor/therapist-seriously. And it HAS to be one who has some experience with eating disorders or they will be of little to no use to you. First I wanna say recently I’ve learned a lot about the BMI scale- basically it should not be used as a way to guide people’s weight and health because it has very little true meaning, it’s narrow and outdated. Someone who works in eating disorders and mental health will understand this and be better able to steer your mindset away from the number focus. My most immediate advice for you is too look up coping skills for ‘intrusive thoughts’, how to push them back when they come into your head and how to reduce them in general. For me, it sounds silly, but I literally shake my head to try and reset and then get up and switch locations. Sometimes even just an environment change can help. As for being terrified to gain weight- I’ve heard that sometimes a hypothetical exercise can help. Like saying “what if I eat a lot of food today? What will happen?” Maybe you’ll say that you could gain some weight. So what happens then? The goal is to answer them as logically as possible, to come to the conclusion that things will be okay no matter what. Please take care if you try this, for some people if you’re too unstable it can just cause more worry. Another method is to try the same exercise with a friend, someone who views you positively. What would they think about your situation/you gaining some weight? Would they think of you any less?",1610975437.0,2021-01-18 07:10:37,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

118,kztxah,None,"What’s helped for me is not buying any snacky, ready-to-eat foods (granola bars, crackers, etc.) If I want to eat, I have to prepare it. That’s been quite a deterrent for me lol",1610989648.0,2021-01-18 11:07:28,AnaDion94,"I think the common thought (and probably the right one) is to not focus on weight loss during this stage of your recovery. And I agree, because I'm doing the same thing and it is a constant struggle.

That being said, this is what worked for me (for about a month before relapsing since the new year): eating *really* healthy meals and working out. That helped disrupt the b/p cycle because I didn't feel as much guilt after eating. Working out helped because burning all that energy made my body desperate enough for energy that I was GOING to eat. It's easy to starve yourself of nutrients if you then just lay in bed all day; it's harder if you're maintaining a somewhat active lifestyle.

My meals were usually a meat, a cooked vegetable, and some sort of huge salad with cheese, craisins, whatever crispy toppings i like, and a homemade dressing (so i could control the amount of salt, fat, and sugar). I tried to minimize saturated fats and sugar, but not shy away from them if needed (like, i don't need butter on broccoli, but I didn't want to hold myself back from adding a bit of honey, cheese, or EVOO to something if i know I'll really enjoy it). As my workout intensity increased I noticed I was getting lots of headaches and tried integrating more carbs, which definitely helped; for me that meant a plain, baked sweet potato or sometimes brown rice. I snacked on fruits and had greek yogurt with granola, dark chocolate, and craisins for when i was caving something sweet. Or a cup of hot chocolate. Or cookies and milk if I felt like living dangerously  :) 

For exercise I literally just jogged in place in my apartment. Sometimes while watching TV. Sometimes listening to the Hamilton soundtrack. Sometimes fast, sometimes just walking. Not necessarily hitting a number of steps, but trying to beat my lowest number over the previous seven days. AND I didn't weigh myself. Weight loss was based on how my clothes fit and comparing my overall fitness (i.e. only being able to jog for like 20 seconds vs 10 minutes)

For me, this was the healthiest I'd been since the pandemic causing ALL my ED behaviors to flair up in the worst way, and I'm trying to fall back into it. I liked being able to enjoy food and enjoy my body without fighting the urge to punish it every time I ate something. 

Good luck with all the things!",1610977185.0,2021-01-18 07:39:45,sweet_ging,"Exercising everyday really helps.

But when I exercise I feel much less anxious and in control and even excited to keep making my body stronger.

Of course this doesn’t fix everything, you can still over eat, be unsatisfied with your weight/ look... but for me I feel much less scared about feeling that way for long because I know how satisfied I feel once I start working my body",1610986434.0,2021-01-18 10:13:54,Lilith-Rising,"Yes it is possible and I’ve done it. If someone told be I couldn’t recover from BED and successfully lose weight from my painful obesity, I would just choose to never recover. It’s definitely possible but I do agree the effort needs to be in feeding your emotional needs. Weight comes off if you burn more energy than you ingest, regardless of whether you obsess over it or not. But instead of focusing on this fact and weight, make a conscious effort to become more in tune with your body and practice healthy/feel good habits and get a routine down. This lays the foundation for a healthier lifestyle and after you have spent less time thinking about weight you may have already seen yourself improve in other areas which builds confidence, and it may only require minor tweaks in your habits to reach future goals. So yes, you can have it all but it’s a matter of prioritizing your mental health enough right now to set numbers aside and build habits and hobbies instead. Progress will come with patience and care. Also I want to add that eating nutritious meals routinely helped disrupt b/p cycles as another poster has mentioned. Getting what you needs daily helps emotionally and physically.",1611000713.0,2021-01-18 14:11:53,iamtryingtobehappy,"It is almost impossible to overcome BED while still maintaining body goals/losing weight/maintaining weight (to use your words). 
I understand how that will make you panic. Hold on, there’s a reason for what I’m saying. I promise it’ll be okay. 

BED stems from restriction. most EDs are a form of restriction. When you binge, you spiral and tell yourself what a horrible thing you’re doing, and you beat yourself up afterward. Even the release of the binge is mitigated after by the horrible self-hate that always follows. This is still a form of restriction. If you are binging, you are restricting. 

That might sound paradoxical, because it is. But when you binge, you are trying to cram as much in as you can because you are in survival mode and you will tell yourself in an hour or so that you will never. Do that. again. That is restriction. 
The only way you can stop binging is by eating what you want. And when you first start this Avenue of recovery, you will want A LOT of it. Who wouldn’t, after being told you can’t have it, etc. ? It’s normal. Uncontrollable hunger is so normal in recovery. Your body is saying, finally!!! Food!!!... the only thing different about this, that makes it not a binge, is that you are kind to yourself afterwards and you sit with yourself as you eat. You don’t black out, you just savor what you have and love yourself. Think about what love looks like, give it back to yourself. 

you might gain weight during this time. That’s normal. Recovery leads to weight gain and body changes. You might gain weight and lose some and gain some back. It’s a process that takes years. I’ve been recovering for a few years and my body shape is changing. I’ve gained weight, lost some, gained it again, gained more muscle. This thing is not linear. And I know what I’m saying can be really difficult to absorb. But you have to leave this mindset of “body goals” and “healthy weight” behind. 

Please trust me sweetie, I KNOW that’s so hard. Even as I write, there’s a part of my brain that laughs at what I said. But know it’s true and good for you. Society’s definition of healthy needs to change and become broader.

I tried the whole eat whatever your body needs thing and it was a shit show. I had extreme hunger that lasted until I went from very underweight to slight overweight and it was traumatizing and caused really bad relapses with subsequent huge binges and eventually constant b/p. I regret not seeking treatment when I was underweight because eating a lot of calories caused refeeding syndrome and it was a truly painful experience on my body and psyche.
The only time I consistently did well with both recovery of some sort and weight loss is when I did a paleo style diet. I ate meat, eggs, lots of veggies and seeds and even made desserts sometimes. I did limit my calories and exercised quite a bit but I actually ate more calories than I would have ever felt comfortable with in the past while trying to lose and the binges almost stopped completely and I lost a lot of weight in like a month.

I think paleo worked for me because I have a lot of dietary sensitivities and really never crave grains anyway. I ate til I was stuffed everyday with rooty vegetables, protein, fruit and seeds and I just felt content all the time. It was also the best way to eliminate processed foods which I find both addictive and too stimulating for me personally and I will overeat them and purge, so it really helped with that. The bloating was not pleasant in the first two weeks because I wasn't used to eat so much volume, but it settled and I saw massive changes in my body. I was happy, I only relapsed because I'm still dealing with water retention and purging makes it go away, but before this relapse doing things this way was the longest I was ever ed behaviour free.",1610993832.0,2021-01-18 12:17:12,2020202838,"Do you think it's normal to think that you're going to become obese if you try to recover (even if you never were clinically obese)?

 I know this stems from fear of weight gain and diet culture, but do you think it is normal to feel like you are eating more food than you think you need/deserve? It's hard to justify eating so much/so often when literally no-one else does it around you. I've been deeply ingrained in diet culture and the fitness community for so long that I find it so hard to think about what 'normal people' feel like around food.

Eat for yourself and your body. If anyone gives you shit for it, try to ignore them. They probably just don’t understand. 

Many times my parents have commented on the amount I eat. I try to brush it off because I know that if I want that second spoonful of pb, I should have it. It’s not going to kill me. If I *dont* have it, I’ll keep thinking about it ... thinking about it... and will eventually binge.

121,kzgz9p,raeg14,"Hi! I went through something similar in the past. Although I wouldn’t recommend weighing yourself during this time, you might gain some weight on the scale at first just from having food in your body now more regularly, and initially hold on to some of it for longer in addition to water while your body re-adjusts to regular food intake again. It may also depend on how long you’ve restricted, and your body may crave certain nutrients it’s been lacking. In terms of if you’ll actually gain weight, I’d say it depends on your body’s set point/healthy range. I’m a big believer that everyone has a sort of set point or healthy range unique to them that your body will fight to be at. You said you have been able to eat whatever you wanted before and stay healthy, so you already know this can be your reality, you just have to trust your body’s mechanism to get you there in the long run as long as you stick to listening to what your body is asking for! 
You also mentioned depression made you gain weight and you’re still dealing with the depression. I’d strongly recommend focusing on trying to get help for your depression as well as your eating at the same time (a therapist, a physician, online groups, hobbies, anything that might work). For me, I dealt with depression as well and coped with it by binging or cycling between binging and restriction which also wasn’t healthy. I knew I should just listen to my body and eat when I was hungry and stop when I was full, and I so badly wanted a healthy relationship with food, but I personally couldn’t do that until I sorted out what was causing my depression and started to heal from that first. Not saying that’s what you’re dealing with exactly or what will happen to you if you start eating more regularly again, but I think it’s just probably even harder to have a healthy relationship with food when you’re also dealing with depression or a situation, relationship, or some other reason contributing to your depression. Best of luck, it’s okay to not have it all figured out and it might take some time and some set backs but know that eating enough everyday even if you’re scared is always worth it, and even if you do gain weight, I promise it’s not going to be the end of the world like you might think it might be! Your relationship with food and quality of life are more important than the scale or how you look!",1610947501.0,2021-01-17 23:25:01,beezusbooflin,"So here’s the thing: it’s entirely likely that your weight gain was due to depression. But if you’re like me, you gained what you perceived to be a lot of weight sometime after you turned fifteen. For me it was my senior year of HS and first year of college. This is NATURAL. Perhaps a significant portion of that weight gain WAS due to depression, but maybe some of it wasn’t.

“Atypical” anorexia is a stupid word. The fact is that your body thinks there is a famine, and even if you may not be underweight according to the bmi scale, you’re probably underweight for your body. I never went below a BMI of 20 and I still needed to gain 15 lbs. to recover because I was underweight for MY body. 

So you probably will gain weight, and it will be absolutely a good thing. You may overshoot your ideal weight, but then it’ll go back down. Depending on what age you were when you got sick (if you were younger than 19 I’d say), your setpoint weight will be higher than it was before you became ill with depression. 

And that is totally okay and normal and necessary. You said you were never overweight (even if you were that would be fine. Some people’s setpoint weight is in the overweight range and that’s healthy for them.) If that’s the case, then you’re not going to be overweight (unless you overshoot, in which case you’ll lose the weight again later.) Your higher weight might be the only healthy weight for you, and that is perfectly normal and fine.",1610984584.0,2021-01-18 09:43:04,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

Portion yourself out a smaller, healthy meal and eat more meals throughout the day compared to your standard 3 meals a day. Focus on meals with plenty of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. These are the three key nutrients to achieve satiation. I don’t know if this is your case but when I heavily restrict, eventually I get so hungry that it will trigger a binge that I will give into. I unfortunately still really control my caloric intake but I’m trying to focus on giving myself more frequent meals and smaller meals throughout the day.

123,kzfnek,DisagreeableCompote,"Maybe try to go vegetarian first? Or even try reducing your meat intake or animal products. 

Vegan is incredibly restrictive in what you can eat. I’ve been a vegetarian for 15+ years, but I still eat eggs and dairy, because cutting those out would limit me to an unhealthy point. And it’s honestly hard sometimes for me to get the nutrition I need even still. But I’m someone who struggles with variety in my diet, but if you’re someone who likes to eat a lot of vegetables maybe it can be okay. Certain vitamins like B12, D, iron, omega3’s, protein, fats can be particularly hard to get as a vegan/vegetarian and you don’t want to become deficient in those. 

So if you do want to go through with it, maybe do some research about what vegan foods (or supplements) will give you the nutrients you need and try to make some meal plans that incorporates those things so your family can be more reassured you can make this lifestyle change in a healthy way?",1610921045.0,2021-01-17 16:04:05,asst2therglmgr,"You can absolutely go vegan and remain healthy. Veganism isn’t just raw fruits and vegetables. There is loads of junk food out there. There are plenty of ways to keep weight on. There will likely be a period of awkwardness on holidays and any other shared meals with family but, bring your own food. If they have questions answer them but don’t get too in-depth. Non-vegans will grill you if you give too much information. They are constantly trying to find fault with the vegan diet. I personally quit animal products immediately 7 years ago and I had no problems. We’re obviously not the same person though. If it’s something you feel passionately about, you should do it. Do it for yourself and don’t worry about what other people say because other people will always have something to say about it. Try to find a local vegan group or something like that. That was extraordinarily helpful for me.

Edit: honestly one of the biggest challenges is dealing with non vegans. They will constantly attack you and, after a while, you learn to just leave it alone because they’ve already decided that veganism is the devil. They don’t typically ask questions because they’re interested. They ask questions so they can find something “wrong” with veganism and be 100% “right” that it is unhealthy and stupid.",1610920911.0,2021-01-17 16:01:51,hannahtb96,"if you are passionate about animal welfare, i would consider only buying and consuming locally and ethically produced/sourced animal products? that way it doesn’t contribute to pollution, factory farming, cruel corporate practices, antibiotic resistance, etc. Therefore you can still eat animal products and not worry about restriction. 

As much as i am sooo happy for you being in recovery and admire your strength, i fear anything even remotely restrictive that would involve a lot of thinking/calculating about food (even something as benign as finding new vegan substitutes and recipes) could set you back. restriction can be such a slippery slope. 

I think maybe veganism can be a recovery goal for you. since you said you had been weight restored “recently”, maybe when you are healthily recovered for one year (or whatever you choose) you can explore the idea again.  

congratulations on your progress and health, and best of luck to you xx",1610927691.0,2021-01-17 17:54:51,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

Also wanna say that for me, and actual medical diagnosis was really validating for me. You can get one from a psychiatrist, therapist/counselor, or physician as long as they’re properly certified. For labeling yourself- try not to worry about the title of an “eating disorder”, but often a medical diagnosis is a really helpful step into forming a real treatment/recovery plan and can open up your world a little bit.

You should definitely bring this symptom up to your psychologist as it will give them more insight about what is going on, and it will allow you to carry on with your recovery.
It is normal wanting to hide it, but be aware that is actually the eating disorder who wants to keep this going.
As you said, purging may become an addictive behavior because it aliviates the food anxiety, gives you a sense of control and feeling of emptiness and cleanliness even. It makes absolute sense that you are afraid to bring it up because they will ""take it"" from you.

I’ve been struggling with my eating disorder since I was 13, and like you, throughout high school my mother brought me to multiple doctors who all suggested inpatient and was absolutely unwilling to stop my life, and also to just be in a place with people I didn’t know. I’d been doing okay for the next few years so I thought I would be able to recover on my own. This isn’t what you want to hear- but I would really encourage you to think a little more on it. There ARE half way programs. For me, I just decided I needed to go inpatient. It’s been too long, and I’m getting worse when I can’t afford to. I’m still struggling with it, but it definitely doesn’t feel like it use to because I’m making it MY decision for MY health. And I’m acknowledging that I won’t be able to focus on school and do well if I’m struggling so much with this. But there ARE treatments even if you’re unwilling to leave school- that are intensive outpatient, which may be what you need.

It was a weird, wild journey that worked out through sheer luck, and I have no idea where I’d be if I’d gone to outpatient, who knows. I think seeing what is available online is a good idea though, there’s a lot of programs happening online in my province. Also, just a side comment, because I know I definitely would have considered going to outpatient as putting my life “on pause”. But now in hindsight I realize that’s not really the case.

It’s been a while for me too, about 7 years, not considering myself in recovery because I haven’t been properly treated. I’ve had this body dysmorphia probably the whole time- but only really started to accept it this past year. I’m not sure if it will ever go away, but something that’s been helpful coming from my counselors is the idea that things that are happening in your head are still real. I felt like I was crazy knowing that what I see in the mirror isn’t entirely accurate and I felt like I never know who I am or what I seem like to people. My therapist reminded me that body dysmorphia is not hallucinations. It’s more like seeing a photo in all the wrong colors than seeing a photo and thinking it’s a table. As for your mother- totally get that. Everytime I come home my mom comments on some part of me that looks thinner and it’s incredibly triggering. Do your best to explain how the comments affect you, but I know that that doesn’t always work especially if she’s mentally ill. Try to understand that since she’s struggling as well- her vision may not be any clearer than yours. She’s your mom too- she’s biased, she’s not objective on the matter.

And god, I'm sorry your mom isn't respecting your boundaries-- that's really shitty (and very generous of you to have compassion for her).

I think I've gotten to a place of self-love, but it looks different from what I expected. It makes me think of some quote I've heard a million times about love being an action, not a feeling. And I think me loving my body looks like me feeding it, me making sure it gets enough sleep, me giving it comfy clothes, and me making sure I give it whatever it needs, even when it's hard or inconvenient (and of course, doing so imperfectly, but always striving to do so). And when I'm taking care of my body, I really do in my heart of hearts \*feel\* love for my body. 

But I guess that love doesn't look like what I'd expected pre-recovery. Pre-recovery, I thought it would look like me thinking I'm hot and pretty no matter what. But now it's more that I love the fact that I love myself, because I recognize how hard I worked for it. And yeah, I think my body is attractive, but I'm not sure I necessarily ""love"" its appearance. I think maybe it's not possible to feel love for the appearance of something, at least for me.

130,kyo51m,ccctee,"Hey! 

First, I have to say: 
A) Congratulations on choosing recovery and for all that you have been able to achieve. I know from experience how hard it is to eat when the ED voice is loud and you have come SO far already but the sounds of it. 
B) Be gentle with yourself. This seems to be very hard for people with eating disorders. We love to beat ourselves up. We are our toughest critics. However, this can make everything harder and can actually lead to more reliance on the eating disorder/unhealthy coping behaviours just for us to feel better. SO many times in the past I would slip and then my self-negativity and feelings of worthlessness would make me feel so bad that I would turn to my ED to cope/feel better. It's a dangerous cycle! 

As for your question, so you jumped on the scale and saw a number you don't like... I don't necessarily think it's a horrible thing to know your weight/BMI. It can be VERY hard to realize you're above a ""normal"" BMI... I have experienced that. I remember how it felt. It may be hard to see this now but it may be for the best if you can continue to push yourself (eat as much as your body is asking for, don't restrict types or quantities of food, don't compensate with exercise/purging). It will train your brain over time that you WILL eat regardless of your weight and that your weight does NOT control you're behaviours. This is a crucial step in recovery. Your body will change MANY times over the course of your life so it's important to learn how to continue looking after yourself/prioritizing recovery despite your body shape/size. 

As for your mother, I'm sorry you feel like she would be disappointed in your weight gain. It's also really healthy that you have enforced some boundaries with her in the last few months if this is what you need for your recovery. Parents can be a huge trigger at times - partially because they are imperfect themselves and have their own food issues/fatphobia but also because they don't often understand what staying at a smaller size cost us. If you have never had an eating disorder, you can't POSSIBLY understand how the constant nagging thoughts, the isolation, the hunger, the obsession with our bodies and the poor self esteem could ruin your life. With my own parents, I had to sit them down and talk to them in depth about it for them to finally understand why I needed to be at a higher weight. I'm lucky they cared and tried so hard to understand me. If your parents aren't like that (or you just don't want to tell them everything), continue to set boundaries and remind yourself that you are looking after yourself, doing what you need to in order to be happy and that they are NOT imperfect and have their own issues. You were not placed on this earth to satisfy other people's opinions of you... 

Lastly, I know it's easy to focus on all that you have lost during your recovery... No, you may not be a size ""x"" again. You may not be the thinnest in the room. You may not ever fit into that pair of jeans you loved at your thinnest. But try to flip the switch in your head and think about all of the things you are grateful for. In recovery, we can have real, authentic relationships. We can be more caring for others because we aren't so self-centred. We can do activities we love and truly ENJOY THEM, not just think of the calories we are burning doing them. Our mood can be more consistent. We can THINK. We have ENERGY. We can live up to our POTENTIAL. We can be happy. We can find true love from people who care about US and not our bodies. 

We can't do any of these things with an eating disorder. 

I wish you only the best. Stay strong. Keep eating. These feelings will pass and you will have a full, happy life ahead of you if you choose recovery.",1610824925.0,2021-01-16 13:22:05,gumptiousguillotine,"Hey, you feeling guilt over taking a step backwards is AMAZING. You feel bad because you know the decision you made isn’t good for you. Do you see how awesome that is? The parts of you that want to fall back into restricting and counting have gotten so small that the voice that wants you to succeed and be healthy is screaming in your ear now. That’s amazing to me.          
     
All you can do is continue to move forward. You made a choice that you know doesn’t serve you, and now you have an even better jumping off point to avoid making similar decisions again. Call your dietician, continue the dialogue with your partner, and absolutely continue the dialogue with yourself. Do not talk down to yourself for making this choice, but talk WITH yourself about why you did, how you feel now, WHY you feel these things now, and how to continue to make the good choices you HAVE been making up until this point.

I felt like the thought came back during dinner, though, and thinking about the possibility I might be losing weight initiated a feeling of deprivation in me, so I ate more than I might have otherwise.  I felt bummed out and disappointed, because I feel like I have more clarity now about deprivation and restriction, and I'm not going to take food away from myself, but yeah, the interplay between weight, body image, and what we eat is tough.

The body is physiologically designed to keep equilibrium between food intake and energy expenditure and that is why it is so difficult to just overcome physiological drives to 're-feed' after a period of starvation. Your body is doing what is designed to but we upset this balance when we leave it too long between meals or aren't eating enough and let blood sugar levels get too low.

In a nutshell, don't get too hungry/starved and you will find your binge eating should subside.

If you happen to be caught out without snacks on-hand or food is a while away, (as can happen sometimes in life) ensure that your first meal is high in protein, has veggies and good fats in it. It will help stop the cycle in its tracks before you lose control.

Sometimes we don't intentionally starve ourself but get stuck chatting to someone or whatever and our food timing is delayed - all we can do is prepare and act the best we can to minimise the negative impact of the vicious cycle on our minds and act accordingly when the time arises. Control what you can as best you can during those times. Life happens!!

I keep almonds/cans of tuna in the the car and in my handbag and pack fruit in my bag, too if I am heading out between meals. If I am going to be out during a main meal time, I even pre-pack my lunch. I just can't stand being hungry these days!! ;-) I eat small balanced meals every 2-3 hours and it seems to kick the cycle!! :-)

132,kyo3k3,Garbage_Patch_Kid,"My boyfriend and I live together and it’s a very similar situation, I eat way more often and he just eats a few times a day. We have pretty different tastes in food and don’t eat at the same times, so we split things. He shops for his groceries, I shop for mine (for the most part). There are some things we share but I make my food and he makes his, we eat when we are hungry. Sometimes we will share food like pizza, and communicate about who gets what (he likes spicy things on his pizza and I don’t, for example, so we have to figure that out beforehand). And sometimes we eat together, but for the most part it’s pretty individual because that’s what works for us. 

I would really encourage you to talk to your boyfriend about all of this! About how you are feeling and what you need for recovery. If he wants something for a recipe, he needs to communicate that with you because food is a sensitive topic and you feel guilty when he says something after the fact. You don’t have to eat the same things at the same time, you just have to figure out what works for your relationship. And the first step is to talk about it!",1610826890.0,2021-01-16 13:54:50,SorchaNB,"Jesus Christ, OP. This sounds like a one-way ticket to relapse. You have a history of bulimia and now your boyfriend is literally making you feel guilty about eating like a normal person, causing you to starve yourself, eat in secret and cry. Look objectively at what you've written there. It's not a good situation at all. 

First off, he knows of your ED history and issues, but does he know the extent of what's going on with you currently? If not, he should. Is there a reason you can't be honest with him about this, perhaps due to shame or fear? Think of it like this: how would you feel if your habits and words were having this awful effect on your partner? You'd want to know, right? A bit of honesty and communication on this front could be the difference between you continuing to suffer needlessly or not. Tell him straight up: ""I have a history of disordered eating and I know you don't mean it but sometimes your words and habits cause me to feel guilty about eating, starve myself, eat in secret and cry"". It might even be worth showing him this Reddit thread. Regardless, it will probably come out eventually if the current situation is taking such a toll.

Secondly, it might be good to surround yourself more with people who eat ""normally"" (ie. several times a day like you do). The more you do this, the more you will break this food-anxiety association that you've built in your relationship with your bf.

His “forgetting” or not being hungry is a trigger for sure. But I’ve talked to him about this and he’s actually been really supportive of me eating when I’m hungry, or even have an appetite as long as it gives me more satisfaction that it does stress. Have you had that talk with your boyfriend? Maybe while he is being understanding of your ed struggles, he doesn’t fully understand what a good relationship with food means to you. Most people I’ve met who have never struggled don’t even realize that the guilt and anxiety we have around food even exists. To them it’s not something to think that hard about. Never be ashamed of your needs to keep that healthy relationship with food. I’ve tried getting healthier snacks or low calorie things so I can eat a bunch but not feel as bad about it.

It's like that function of autocorrect where your keyboard mislearns a word and keeps ""correcting"" it to the wrong word every time you try to type it... And you certainly CAN retype it the correct way every time it pops up but until you go into the programming and correct it at that deeper level, it's just going to keep popping up as the wrong one. Mindfully correcting it works but it's exhausting and easy to not notice so it sometimes slips on by you. 
I work with people with eating disorders every day and I've found that anorexia often has a deep self-belief component of being afraid to grow up, and/or wanting to be invisible and overlooked. 
When I'm able to help my patients recover whatever memory it was that first formed this belief in their unconscious mind, they can finally release it and we can rewrite the programming together. It's always such a huge shift for them to acknowledge the difference between maintaining a healthy weight and eating habits with conscious effort and simply loving themselves and their bodies so much that it automatically translates into honoring their body naturally and effortlessly in everything they do... Which includes what they feed it 
I wish you all the best on your healing journey! I struggled with anorexia myself for several years. Sadly for me, when in thought I'd healed from it back then, I didn't and over time it morphed into bulimia instead. I lived with they for decades.

140,kxstn1,Babygirl_charliexxx,"I struggled with this for years. I ignored a knee and hip injury because of the guilt from not running and pushing through it. This ended up with my knees buckling from under me on a treadmill and collapsing. This obviously led to me being banned from the gym by my parents (I was 16 at the time).

Now at 21, I am a little bit of a gym rat but in a good way. I lift weights and eat protein but still have relapses a few times a year when I am stressed.

These relapses are the times that my knee and hip begin to lock up again. 

Now I know you don’t want me to tell you that eating more helps repair injuries as I am sure you know and this isn’t why you’re here.

If I am struggling to get back into eating and I have injuries, I ice it in the morning for an hour and elevate it. Before exercising again I put a heat pack on for an hour. Take ibuprofen before exercising to reduce swelling if it happens again. 

Also, try upping protein. Just one whey isolate protein shake in the morning or evening will help repair your injury so much. Whey isolate usually has 90 calories for 30g of protein and will help a lot. If not, try cottage cheese before bed as this type of protein (casein) is a slow digester and will keep you fuller for longer as well as slowly releasing protein as you sleep.

I hope your injury gets better and you could possibly get into the mindset of food is fuel! Good luck!",1610712043.0,2021-01-15 06:00:43,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

143,kxstk6,EDRD621,"Hi,

I'm an eating disorder Dietitian who works with a variety of people struggling with disordered eating. The ED voice that comes alongside eating disorders can be very tricky. One thing I want you to notice is that you say 'I like how I'm clearly losing weight', while also talking about all the negatives associated with it. Be very certain that it's the ED that likes you losing weight, not you.   


The cycle of restricting and binging is also very difficult and needs to be broken. When we restrict food from ourselves, our body begins to do anything it can to stop that. Constant thoughts about food, obsessives planning, worrying, difficulty focusing - these aren't just you, these are scientifically proven side effects of food restriction. Ancel Keys took a group of healthy individuals, gave them 1/2 the calories they needed and over the course of a few weeks they started to get those exact symptoms.  Health and survival is your body's #1 concern and when we fight against that, the body ramps up everything it can to stop that.   


Problem is that the body isn't physiologically built with the best mechanisms so hormones that effect hunger actually become less effective if we don't listen to it. Our body produces a ton of ghrelin (hunger hormone) to tell us we are hungry, and doesn't really stop until either we eat, or we've been exposed to so much ghrelin our receptors end up not wanting anything to do with the hormone because there's so much. 

&#x200B;

Often my clients will tell me 'I done this forever, I feel mostly fine'. Food and eating are moreso how we control long term health. You haven't sustained massive trauma like a broken limb that needs to be attended to right away. Time does catch up, and some things can't be reversed. I won't go into the details because I'm already typing a lot, haha.   


So what can you do? Well we need to schedule some times to sit down and have a meal or snack. Three times a day have a meal. We don't plan around possible binges, but we do plan our meals to prevent binging. If a meal doesn't contain Carbohydrate, Protein, and Fat then you're more likely to binge, empirically. Meaning this isn't something you control, we've done the studies and research and more often people binge without those components at meals. Want to know another fun fact? When we have a meal containing protein, and right after have something 'sweet' that we enjoy, like a cookie, binging episodes go down massively.   


You have to know, and this is really important, that restricting is causing your body to respond with binging. Allowing yourself foods you enjoy alongside a regular meal and snack schedule will prevent these binging episodes. Start with something small and manageable, if you're only eating one meal - try two scheduled meals. If you're already doing two meals, try three schedule. Etc. You got this.",1610724237.0,2021-01-15 09:23:57,SpecialSeasons,"Will power. Self love. 

Its a journey and once you fall into the toxic world of ana (or mia) those thoughts will always be there, waiting to take you back under.

I have been slipping, recently, as well. The thing that I have been trying to do is cook breakfast and dinner, even if I'm not hungry, and attempt to eat.

Lately, it's resulted in me giving the majority of my food to my dogs but.. At least I'm trying.

My advice to start eating normally again is to forget about restrictions and just eat what you want when you’re hungry. Basically, just try and ignore any type of worrying thoughts about food and dismiss them as ridiculous and harmful to your health. For example, if you want a cookie then go get one. If you want some chips then go get some. It’s ok to get fast food and to have it guilt free. And eat healthy foods like fruits veggies and meats if you want. Food is meant to be enjoyed and enjoying food is a part of life. I used to eat intuitively (just ate what I wanted when the time came, til I was full and not in excess) and I was not even close to being overweight (not like being overweight is anything super horrible, but just saying that if you don’t restrict you won’t gain 10000 pounds and eventually your body will be self regulating and at a happy and healthy weight). 

I’m no expert in EDs whatsoever but I just wanted to give you my advice in case it helps. 

Btw after a while you won’t even think of food, and when you do think of food allow yourself to have it in moderation and til you are full and satisfied.

It will actually make it very difficult since it will mess up your metabolism.
It could be depression from his living situation, and the weight.
Consider his roommates his family and have a talk with them please. Since they’re the ones that probably see him the most.
And remind him to eat and drink water. Even if it annoys him.
I don’t know his financial situation, whether he or his roommates work, but they have to buy proper food.

When talking abt it, make sure to come from a place of love, not authority, tell him you care about him and that u want him to live a happy and healthy life. As someone who struggles with ED tendencies, I tend to avoid and/or manipulate conversations around my diet so having a talk may not help. Instead, help him eat healthier. Maybe pick up a pre-made salad at the grocery store instead of getting takeout. Tell him to get frozen veggies to throw in ramen as it cooks. Ask him to cook a healthy food for you (I like broccoli, chicken breast, and zucchini). These are just ideas btw no pressure haha. I always appreciate when people get me healthy food or keep my interests in mind when eating. 

Another separate thing I want to mention is that EDs aren’t always about food, they’re more about control. He may feel out of control in the environment so maybe helping him regain control will help him be more healthy. Ask if you can help him decorate his room or help clean the kitchen. DO NOT insult the place he lives - this always always makes people feel like shit. Talk positively about his place and he’s going to move forward much faster. Establishing a healthy routine can also establish a sense of control too, like wake up, drink a smoothie, study till 12, eat, read, workout, shower, eat. Sry that was a lot of info but I hope this helps :)",1611628477.0,2021-01-25 20:34:37,Idrisnite,"Sorry, I don't have advice, just wish you guys well. I feel him.",1611616253.0,2021-01-25 17:10:53,enord11400,"You could try talking with him about nutrition first. A shocking number of people think crash dieting is an acceptable weight loss method and don’t realize it has been widely proven to not work long term or they think they can force themselves to be the exception. However plenty of people also fall into an eating disorder this way so it really is a slippery slope. Many of those people also do not realize they have an eating disorder until someone tries to tell them they have to stop or they might die. Personally I can’t relate as I knew exactly what I was doing to myself from day one, but a close friend of mine was laying in the hospital still insisting that she just accidentally took a diet too far. She had a bmi of about 20 at the time so you are right to be concerned now. You do not have to be underweight to be at risk of serious complications from an ED. If he just wants to lose weight he should see if his school has any nutritional counseling services or something of that sort. If he starts acting differently like more withdrawn, significantly more or less emotional, sleeping a lot more or a lot less then those might be signs this may be more or a mental health situation. You could try asking his roommates if they’ve noticed anything different about him. It could still be a mental health issue even if nothing seems wrong. You’re right to remain vigilant but if he’s suffering from a mental illness then it is cruel to try and make him feel bad about it. I know that probably wasn’t your intention at the time, but try and be mindful that he isn’t trying to hurt you and all you can do is let him know you care about him the way he is and let him know you will help him however you can. Also remember that you can not help someone who doesn’t want your help and that’s not your fault.",1611626915.0,2021-01-25 20:08:35,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

He definitely had a problem of some kind. Keep in mind that you don’t know exactly what it is. He could have ARFID, he could be struggling with depression or digestive issues that make it hard to eat. Though it does sound like it is likely body image related - that’s just something to keep in mind. 

If you haven’t already, I would strongly consider sitting him down and saying that you need to talk about something serious, what he is doing is not normal and could harm his health, and he needs to get help. Maybe find some resources he could use: a dietitian, a therapist, a mental health center, etc. If I where you, I would tell him that it is really important to you that he gets help - here are a few places he could go, or he could find some place himself.

He's definitely displaying some disordered behaviors, but I wouldn't say he has a full blown eating disorder yet (He's definitely moving in that direction though).  And the reason I am making that distinction is because there is still a huge stigma that ""men don't get eating disorders."" We all know that's not true, but if you flat out tell him you think he has an eating disorder verbatim, he won't see a problem because that's not something men ""get"" ...so you really can't approach it from that angle -- that's probably why you didn't get a response when you did try to speak up. 

Depending on what his fitness goals are, you may be able to work that angle into addressing how he is eating.",1611686310.0,2021-01-26 12:38:30,tuckerlyn,Highly agree.

OP I recently got worried my friend had an eating disorder because of how much xxxx cals he would post on twitter or call himself a f**ass and talked so much about working out. So I reached out to him and told him that’s he’s still okay and he still has a chance to not suffer this he’ll hole of an eating disorder. I was right he was becoming anorexic but he didn’t know enough. I said that his metabolism will get fucked up and from then on it’ll get less and less and less and less until there’s nothing left. That it will be all he’ll think about day in and day out. From the moment he wakes up planning the entire day to the moment he sleeps regretting what he ate or didn’t eat. This won’t ever make him happy. 

You can tell him that too. Tell him how you had suffered. Tell him you’ll be there to help. You both can go to a real nutritionist together and he can start eating what’s good for him and he’ll believe it because it’s a professionals opinion. He can try out bulking at the gym. Yes he can be broke but healthy food can still be easy to come by. Vegetables are cheaper, even frozen veggies. Or canned veg and fruit. 

But also reassure him that no matter the struggle you’ll be there for him, lest he start hiding the disorder from you.",1611637119.0,2021-01-25 22:58:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
150,l4zmqb,iwantanorangemouse,"Anorexia ≠ the desire to be thin. That’s an incorrect stereotype, AN can be “caused” or “motivated” by multiple reasons including but not limited to (and often a combination of many of these reasons) genetic predisposition, OCD tendencies, diet culture, bullying, trauma (usually sexual), gender dysphoria, etc. I have AN and it stemmed from trauma, and trying to gain some semblance of control in my life. Everything was falling apart but I could control what I ate, and I could make it “perfect”. I had never struggled with body image issues in my life before developing my disorder, and didn’t intend to “get thin” by restricting. It was purely about control and perfectionism.

\--Drink lots of water. This helps to heal your gut and cleanse your body from the inside.

It isn’t easy but it definitely is possible. Myself and some of my friends are in recovery and one thing we do to help each other out is meal/snack support over zoom or FaceTime if one of us is struggling and that’s been really helpful. I’m down to do that with you if that could be of any help to you. I’d also like to second what someone said about unfollowing people or things that will trigger your eating disorder- I had to delete everything except Reddit and found that to be really helpful because there is so much diet culture/pro eating disorder content out there that wasn’t contributing to my recovery and I didn’t find the risk of being triggered and sent into a tailspin worth it anymore.

Helped me is writing down a list of things that I enjoy doing that I can’t do if I’m consumed by me eating disorder and then doing those things even something as small as playing with my dog or being present in my friendships.

don't force yourself. go small steps, set small goals. 
smoothies help, and things that don't taste much. basically what you would eat if you are sick. admit yoh are sick and you deserve to heal. you deserve to eat and also you deserve to take those nurishment from the food to make you into you.
if yoh cant get professional help get your friends or family help. not from someone who would not take this seriously though.

That in an of itself is so powerful...and it might be part of the reason she's not wanting to talk about it with you: she doesn't want to hurt you any more than she's convinced she already is.

When I was going through my decades of anorexia and bulimia, I was DESPERATE for someone to help me, yet by accepting their help I believed I would be hurting them even more. I was convinced my mere existence and my inability to be perfect -- or at the very least have my best be good enough -- was causing people around me so much pain that the only way I could numb the pain for me was to not eat/binge and purge. I also believed the only way to stop me from hurting everyone else was to not be around.

Any time I tried to tell someone how I was feeling, they'd tell me I was wrong, they cared, and I wasn't hurting them -- again reinforcing my twisted belief that I couldn't even get my own thoughts right and pushing people away even further. It was a horrible, vicious, cycle.

Once someone saw me for who I was rather than what I was doing, things started to change.

Maybe you could share my post with your sister and ask her if this is how she's feeling too. And then just listen. Your sister doesn't need ""fixed."" She just needs to know she's heard, loved, and good enough. From there the healing can start.

From there ask her what she would like to have happen and what it would take for her to get better...and how you can help her get treatment. Please remember even though you're her sister and you love her immeasurably, you're not qualified or responsible for her treatment. It's not your burden to carry even though it is without question a burden. You can help her best by helping her get to the place where people trained to help her can do just that.

You get the privilege of letting her know she matters, she's good enough, and she's worthy not because of the things she does or doesn't do but simply because she's alive.

In the meantime:
I have a low appetite from messing up my hunger cues by years of restrictive dieting and now I take adhd meds (getting dx was one of the best things that happened to me) and a different med that can make me not feel hungry.I eat mechanically most of the time - so eat about every four hours or try to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Ideally I have a snack between lunch and dinner. Most of the time I don't have a big problem eating a meal. Sometimes what I had planned on eating for lunch especially, I try to eat it, it is something I know I like, but it tastes off or I just can't swallow it. 
Instead of trying to force it, I stop and eat something else. Usually a protien smoothie with frozen fruit or ice cream blended in. I have other go to snacks I can usually get myself to eat.

The most important thing is you eat regularly. It doesn't really matter right now what you eat. Do not worry about it being ""healthy"" or ""good"" for you. Your goal is to find things you can tolerate eating and going to a doctor.",1611536507.0,2021-01-24 19:01:47,cetaceansituation,"To add to the above comment and address your limited eating schedule:

Of those things, try to always have some sort of snack you know you like with you in your bag. Talk to your teachers about what's been going on and let them know how important it is that you eat something if the urge comes up. Chances are they'll give you permission to eat in class or at least tell you it's okay to excuse yourself for a few minutes to have something.

Have you tried Ensure or Boost? They're liquid dietary supplement/replacements. Avoid the high iron one, as it can be pretty metallic, which I suspect wouldn't sit well with you, but they aren't bad tasting and they would give you the vitamins and calories you need without making you work for it (chewing).

If you haven't been eating because of little to no appetite, you will likely be deficient in a lot of vitamins.

I would suggest you take a trip to your GP to get your iron levels (as well as other vitamin levels) checked out. Once you get some supplementation back into your system and build up iron levels and other vitamins as needed, your appetite should return to normal. Then you're good to maintain them cos you'll feel like eating.

Deficiency in vitamins can worsen existing feelings of anxiety, depression, etc...

My weight has gone down. My weight has mostly stayed the same, give or take a few pounds, for the last year or so.

I am at the higher end of a healthy weight for my height, but am not at a weight in which I feel my best. I currently do not feel 100% in mind or body because of my weight, so I would like to lose weight by means of healthy lifestyle changes.

It doesn’t seem to work the same way it does for others. Then again, I am the absolute WORST judge of all things when it comes to my body and food. It is still something I am practicing I suppose.

The thing that keeps me in line, refusing to return to my eating disorder: 

Remembering. I remember what I was like. I remember how insufferable I was, not only for the people around me, but also insufferable to be in my own skin. I wanted to die. There was no joy. Relationships were shit.

Now? I can truly say, for the first time that I can remember, I am happy. So what if I am not at a number that makes me FEEL happy? That number won’t make me happy. Feelings aren’t facts. 

I need to be reminded this. Daily. Because it is so tempting to chase the feeling. I’m romanticizing the entire experience of being terribly terribly ill. How perverse. How heartbreaking. But when reminded this is not truth, it is easier to continue practicing recovery.

I have made a lot of changes, including changing my mental health medications.

It is easy to go back to behaviors, but those are not only bad for your physical and mental health, but they are not sustainable. You will inevitably burn out.

The best way (based on my research so this is just my **non**\-professional opinion) to permanently lose fat is to gain muscle. Important to note that losing weight is not the same as losing fat. Progress might be slow because you may not be giving your body time to recover and repair muscles. The attached link to this post is a video by a youtuber who can explain it much more than I ever can. Natacha bases everything she says on science and not bullshit/diet culture. She's helped me so much - I've had a history of overtraining and extreme calorie restriction and I sincerely hope she'll be able to help you too.

I just went to my Dr last week for an unrelated reason but asked him for a referral to a dietitian or nutritionist because I was afraid that if I started calorie counting again I would fall back into my old habits. He suggested trying to count calories to see how many I am normally eating/day but not to cut any the first week, then cut 15% for a few weeks, ultimately slowly decreasing the amount to what I *should* be eating. But all I heard and what has stuck with me is ""cut calories"".  It's only been 5 days and I've slipped so quickly back into old habits and as much as I hate to admit it, it feels so good.

It’s frustrating because we’ve all been fed the lie that health has a “look” when in reality, you can tell very, very little about someone’s health based on their appearance. Weight loss is not a behavior - it’s a potential outcome of pursuing health. And for someone in recovery from an ED, pursuing weight loss is almost a guaranteed relapse or path to pseudo-recovery/quasi-recovery. 

HAES means that regardless of body size, humans deserve to be treated with respect and given access to health treatment without a side of weight-stigma (which has been shown to be more harmful to health than living in a larger body). I don’t know how anyone with a heart who genuinely understands this philosophy could be against HAES. It’s cruel to judge and dismiss people bc of their weight. An example is how ED treatment is sometimes withheld from people in bigger bodies. 

Intuitive eating is not at all about eating unhealthily or giving in to every urge. It’s about listening to your body. Hunger, fullness, satiety, even learning ways to cope with your emotions are all principles of this practice. 

Which is why I said to look into these philosophies. For me, my ED was a lot about control. Trying to recover from it with more control never yielded any results.

164,l3n2s3,loz303,"This is really tricky. Obviously everyone is different, but I know that for a lot of people, eating disorders are really really hard to talk and open up about, because people struggle to understand. I always worry that people are judging me, think I’m pathetic, making issues out of nothing, should ‘get over it’, ‘just eat’, there’s ‘nothing wrong with you...’ While your comment may have just been ignorance, in her eyes it could’ve indicated more such as a lack of sympathy towards her. You need to show her that’s not what you’d feel/think/say when she opens up, and that you do care. 

The fact that she’s previously opened up to you is a really good sign. That you betrayed that trust, is not. But, it’s very easy to slip up accidentally and not realise that what you’re saying can hurt someone you love, especially when it’s hard to understand their disorder. I trust that the fact that you’re seeking advice, realise your mistake and want to fix it is a good indication that what you said was completely unintentional and accidental. 

My partner is not educated on eating disorders. He admits to not knowing much or understanding. But he tries his best to be deeply emphatic and sympathetic. I think the best thing you can do is listen to her. Encourage her to open up more about how she’s feeling, her past, her present, her thoughts. Then show, again and again, that she CAN in fact trust you with what she tells you. This will take time. She won’t open up all in one go, especially considering you’ve recently broken her trust. But proving that it was a genuine mistake can only be done by showing that you won’t do it again. 

Perhaps research more into her disorder in your own time. You don’t necessarily need to tell her you’ve done this, but it may help give you an insight into how she’s feeling before she tells you. This gives you a chance to prepare yourself - what to say, what definitely not to say. Yet, the most important thing is to actively listen to her. Never be dismissive of her, particularly when she’s opening up.

This is all I can think of to help with long term healing, but this is not a quick fix. In the meantime, there’s slightly more stereotypical, less meaningful things you can do to show that you’re sorry and that you love her. These are still important for short term forgiveness - you can say you’re sorry all you want, but these help show that you are as you’re putting thought and action into the apology. Flowers, a handwritten letter (possibly apology letter), plan date night, other stuff more attuned to your relationship. 

Overall, communication is key to solving this. Sit down with her, and perhaps even ask if there’s anything she specifically needs from you to help you both move past this.

Good luck",1611463296.0,2021-01-23 22:41:36,treenetee,"can you really ever fix that? people who have eating disorders remember every remark made, every insult given, i can 99% be sure that you fucked up the relationship, why didn’t you apologize right then and there and have the shitty “friends” stop making remarks. what a fucking douche bag. honestly it would be better to leave and have her find someone who doesn’t make such a low joke to someone you KNOW has an eating disorder, im honestly disgusted.",1611488099.0,2021-01-24 05:34:59,Maurixox,Yeah there’s no fixing that,1611560424.0,2021-01-25 01:40:24,None,YTA,1611520586.0,2021-01-24 14:36:26,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

In the mean time, distraction helps me a lot when eating alone. I'll watch a TV show/movie/Youtube video I like to create feelings of happiness around meals and allow me to mechanically eat more easily. Also, rewarding myself with an enjoyable activity afterwards helps sometimes.

Wish I saw this earlier.  I have so much to say on this topic I started a website. [www.alsana.org](https://www.alsana.org) or [www.castlewoodvictimunite.org](https://www.castlewoodvictimunite.org)  To everyone, be VERY careful, ask a lot of questions, do your research.  When my daughter went to treatment at Alsana aka Castlewood Treatment Center we didn't know the right questions to ask.  Today I would look for reviews from other mental health consumers, for example on Yelp and HealthGrades. [Look up their license](https://www.asppb.net/page/LicenseLookup). Every state has a free online database with information about licensed professionals. If they don’t show up there, they may not be licensed. If they are listed there, see if they have been disciplined by their board for misbehavior. (Note: The absence of a disciplinary order does not indicate that the individual has never been punished by their licensing board; many states only keep disciplinary orders available online for a certain amount of time. These disciplinary orders, if they exist, can usually be obtained through a public records request. In some states, you can even request all the complaints filed against a licensed professional.) Alarms should go off if any of the following cautions applies to your therapist: Pushes patient toward an abuse narrative, especially one involving childhood sexual abuse, that doesn’t fit that person’s memories before entering therapy. In these cases, the therapist will often interpret all symptoms as evidence of that narrative, even if the patient disagrees. Physical symptoms may be interpreted as evidence of “body” or “somatic” memories of the abuse stored outside the brain in the affected body part.  
Interprets the patient’s vague feelings, flashbacks, dreams, guided images, and fleeting emotional reactions literally. Dismisses the patient’s doubt, skepticism, or need for external proof that the abuse occurred as evidence of “being in denial.”  Eating disorder treatment has a high rate of relapse and many treatment centers are owned by large for-profit corporations.

Renfrew Res does have the UT curriculum but at the residential level of care there’s more to it (I agree IOP got repetitive fast). They have three stages—E, A, and T. E is very similar to the IOP stuff but A is more exposure work around uncomfortable emotions and body sensation which was helpful for me and T stage is personalized exposures created by the team for you (I never made it to T stage but some friends who did had exposures around getting clothes at the mall, or singing in public (it was tied to her trauma).

170,l3myjr,Vegan_8,"This is why the bmi requirement of diagnoses in anorexia is so stupid and bullshit...”atypical anorexia” is still just anorexia. I actually had that exact convo with my old psychiatrist when she diagnosed me with anorexia. I was like “??? My bmi is technically normal though because it’s not under *x*” and she said 1) that bmi means nothing and is bs; she pointed out that I’d lost so much weight and said that I was underweight even if my bmi didn’t clinically reflect that. And 2) that even if you wanted to call it atypical anorexia by considering the weight thing, it is still anorexia. They also mentioned that the DSM requirement for anorexia diagnoses of being underweight has been dropped, now it’s more of an individual basis/consideration based on your individual weight history and trends or something like that. 

I think the bmi thing is stupid and invalidates so many people. Some people have metabolisms that are more genetically rigid than others and find that their metabolism adapts really quickly to slow down almost immediately on few calories so weight loss is hard, whereas others find that if they don’t eat as much for just a couple days they can drop weight like crazy. Both people can do the exact same behaviors and have their health and lives affected by their ed in so many ways, but one can look absolutely emaciated and clearly underweight whereas the other one can look more “normal” in the eyes of our society. That’s genetics, my dietitian explained this to me a bit and you can also research genetic variability in eds, it’s interesting. But my point is, weight should *not* be a factor in diagnosing a *mental* illness like eating disorders. If your thoughts are constantly focused on your ed and you are miserable and it is affecting your life, you deserve help and are “sick enough” no matter your size or if your bmi is “technically normal” or not based on the highly flawed bmi chart. I really think you should get help but just know that your primary care doctor probably isn’t well versed in eating disorders and won’t know how to accurately help or diagnose you, especially with consideration to weight as *not* being a determining factor in diagnosis. I think you should ask for a referral to an ed-specializing dietitian and a therapist (often they work as teams to help you). 

Best of luck to you and your recovery—you deserve it!!",1611445358.0,2021-01-23 17:42:38,vintagecedarwood,"I have a diagnosis despite not going to a doctor at all while at a low BMI.

I had the same thing when I started eating more. Things will eventually balance out.

Your appetite will eventually go back to normal, don’t worry. Things like peanut butter, avocado, etc. that are quick but filling are a good go to for if you are still feeling hungry but tired of eating.

172,l3mu7j,Tea-rex-,"I had an ED for 8ish years and started to enter recovery about 2 years ago so it can definitely be a super long journey but I think it’s amazing how supportive you already are and that you’ve noticed he is having problems eating. Ultimately, the sooner they are addressed the sooner he can recover.

Some things that helped me with my boyfriend were:

1. Making sure he was fully educated on EDs and all the misconceptions (you’ve already done this)

2. If I would call myself fat or say I felt that way, he would gently take out a picture of me and ask me if I could honestly say those things to me - this is a difficult exercise I learnt in therapy, it’s quite hurtful and hard to say those things to myself but it makes me realise I don’t want to say those things, and I wouldn’t say those things to someone else so why me. 

3. Finding good distractions after eating to reduce the intrusive thoughts and panic attacks - walks/reading/movie/writing (my therapy journal) 

4. Instead of telling me I wasn’t fat or I ugly, he’d ask me why I felt that way. Unfortunately if we believe we’re fat/ugly hearing that we’re not doesn’t always help and what can be useful is exploring what it is that is making me feel that way. 

5. I know that you’ve tried to get him to access help but it does sound like he would benefit from talking to a doctor/therapist. You could try gently suggesting this, say you’d go with him for support and see if he’d like that.",1611478999.0,2021-01-24 03:03:19,Luc-2001,"I'm a transguy who fought with an eating disorder myself, so I can relate pretty good to your boyfriend. There are a lot of trans masculine people out there who try to be as thin as possible to not look feminine, because the point is: it works!
 Most of them may think (including me) this isn't an eating disorder and they have everything under control, they believe they could stop whenever they want. Sadly it's not true, if you're once in it you're in and it' very hard to get it out of your head. Maybe it started from another point, with other intentions, but the results are the same. And it's hard to live with all these thoughts about calories and food in your head,  especially when dysphoria is also a thing.

Probably it's the same for your bf than it was for me, only transitioning can help. If he feels good in his body, maybe the struggles with weight get better too. It won't stop from one day to another, maybe it will never be completely gone, but this could be the way. First you should talk to him about that, if he also thinks so and what his plans are.",1611518783.0,2021-01-24 14:06:23,moth-moth,"Hi there! Speaking as someone who had anorexia it’s definitely going to be a long haul for him to get back to normal care free eating. But it can absolutely happen. Here were a few things my boyfriend did to support me:

1) when I said something negative about my appearance/ weight he’d take me aside and ask why I think that then tell me what he saw. It didn’t always help in the moment, but it helped overall because I could say to myself that maybe  I wasn’t seeing myself clearly if he doesn’t see all of the issues I was seeing.

2) He would lightly guilt trip me into having treats/desserts because he’d say he was worried about me and didn’t like seeing me punishing and denying myself of anything. Again in the moment it didn’t always work but overall it did.

3) I guess similar to 1, he made it so I was comfortable talking to him about what it felt like/ worries/etc and listened really well, and we could have a conversation about it. So I didn’t feel alone because we were on the same page. 

It took two years with him before I got to the point where I can eat food without worrying about calories, or carbs or portion sizes or trying bites of food I wouldn’t normally eat, and I just eat what I’d like to. There is no real magic trick to my knowledge that makes things better, it’s just a lot of little things over time make a big difference.

I and many people I know struggled the same way. The more weight you put on, the more it grows into your chest, hips, etc. Helping him get more comfortable with his body would help, but since transitioning physically normally takes forever, maybe working out with him would help. Eating a lot, especially chicken, eggs, etc with protein, and lifting weights will help him build muscle. Maybe by explaining that to him, like “I can’t really help you with your dysphoria, but I can help you develop a more manly body with eating more especially protein and working out, maybe you can get a little more comfortable in your body.” That seemed to help me before medically transitioning.",1611521496.0,2021-01-24 14:51:36,Woolly-hat-taker,"thank you :). I really appreciate what you said and I would like to think that I'm doing a good job.

I would like to think I'm quite educated, although I am aware I could probably do more. and I will. 

as for number 2, I cant say I did it but I'm happy you told me and it's definitely something I will try to implement. it sounds like it could work and would help him to realise how he feels about himself isnt true. 

3 is difficult as I dont live with him and end up seeing him 1 or 2 times every week (about every 5 days). This hurts as I know how much having me around all the time physically would help, as I've seen that when I have been around him. he does often distract himself afterwards and sometimes we do stuff together, but it is a bit more difficult when I cant be with him.

4 is also definitely a good idea. it hurts when I tell him he isnt any of those things and nothing goes in, so I'm deginitely gonna try that as something new. thank you :)

he does have a therapist, and is just starting to see him again now. he has previously lied about how he has been doing with his eating but promised me he would bring it up next time, which will be in 5 days. I would love to go with him if I can but with covid I doubt it will be allowed given that technically I'm not even supposed to be meeting socially with him (dont worry, I havent been planning any house parties). I really hope I can because I know it would help him, and he has said it himself too.

if I'm 100% honest I'm not entirely sure how much more of it I can take as it hurts me alot and is affecting me mentally and even physically (tight chest, some pain). I doubt it will come to a point where it gets too much for me as we are seeing some signs of improvement already and that is ultimately what I'm doing this for, and I would like to think that it will be at least relatively consistent. I know he will have off days but I really hope he doesnt dip too hard and too consistently again.
I completely understand if you dont have the time or cant be too bothered but I replied to another comment and I'd you could read that too then I would be very grateful, incase there is anything in there you feel like you could add to.

thank you so much for your comment :)",1611484371.0,2021-01-24 04:32:51,Woolly-hat-taker,"it scares me to think it could be that long, I care about him far beyond anything else. seeing him do this to himself greatly distresses me and it affects my own mental health too and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep watching it.hes been through a similar spell before which I believe took him about 6 months to get out of to some extent. From what I know, dont think he ever got into a position where he was able to eat and not count any calories and not worry at all, but he was eating healthily to some degree which is what matters to me the most. I do want him to get totally better and I think he is already showing signs. he is starting to get his cravings for food back which he said he wasnt getting before, and he has eaten at least one tiny little thing for the last few days. my main concern is how much he exercises along with this. since the day he ingested a large amount of calories (4 days ago) he hasnt had a day where he has eaten/drank more calories than he burned off. I'm not an expert and I wouldnt assume you are either but I dont hink that's good.

As for what you said your boyfriend did, I can confidently say 3 is something I am already doing, and 2 is also something I have done to an extent. i do tell him how much it hurts me to watch him do this to himself, and half of what he has eaten recently has been down to me directly or him doing it for me. A question I have, should he know about what I have posted here? would this be a similar kind of thing that shows him how much I care and how much I want him to be able to break out of this? or would it be a bad idea. i feel like i could talk through what everyone has said aswell and see how he feels about it.

thank you for your comment. it's really helpful :)",1611482932.0,2021-01-24 04:08:52,Tea-rex-,"I did mean to say to make sure you are taking time to look after yourself. It’s hard having mental health issues because you don’t want to affect those you care about and them get weighed down but then you also need their help which can obviously put strain on them which you don’t want...it can be a horrible cycle. But it is so so so important for you to look after yourself and make sure that you have support. I don’t know where you’re based but the UK eating disorder charity, beat, has resources for carers too and advice. There’s also a helpline or support groups (which some find helpful some don’t) but you could consider to get advice not just from those who have suffered with EDs but those who care for them, like yourself. 

I used to lie to my therapist. I wanted everyone to stop worrying about me but ultimately I was lying to myself because as much as I wanted to get better I wasn’t ready to. As in, I knew I needed to eat and I wanted to stop having all these anxieties and intrusive thoughts but I was still so desperate for the false security my ED gave me. It wasn’t until a couple of years ago when I did unfortunately experience serious health problems that I decided I really had to recover and was ready to recover so it really is just a matter of when he individually is ready to take the plunge into getting better. 

I’m not sure how best to advise on telling him you’ve spoke about it. I only say this because sometimes you can be in such denial and be upset that someone has spoken about you even if it’s come from a place of love. I had a friend who I noticed had definitely developed anorexia (purely because of my experience). She was totally in denial and I got so worried that I reached out to her boyfriend hoping he might get through to her and she was so hurt and upset as she felt I had no right to disclose her issues to anyone. I’m not at all saying that is how your boyfriend would react and it could be incredibly helpful for him to realise there are so many with the same symptoms as him who have recovered and have some advice for you both 

I think it’s just about how you word it, making it clear that you’ve been getting worried about him (and your own mental health) and want to care for him as much as possible that you sought advice on how to help (which is true) or you could even suggest getting advice from others to test the waters and see how he feels about that?",1611486724.0,2021-01-24 05:12:04,moth-moth,"I guess at least from my perspective it wouldn’t hurt to tell him that you posted on the sub because you’re worried; mainly because it’s just best not to have secrets, especially since EDs tend to be secretive enough as it is. My boyfriend was the first I outright told I had had an ED and it was really nice just to have that person I could always be honest with and who would be upfront with me. 

Another thing that helped kick the last of the cyclical food related thoughts for me was cooking at home more, that way I knew what was in a dish and it was all dishes that I liked and couldn’t really get where I live, so that definitely prompted me into eating more and not feeling as restrictive. It also just made food into an activity and something we could do together instead of a puzzle that could never be solved. 

I guess I’ll also say that I didn’t come out of it exclusively because of my boyfriend though he very much helped. It just kind of clicked for me one day that I didn’t want to be a damsel in distress because of this, I wanted to be the the one running the show and I didn’t want to physically strong rather than weak and willowy. So while it is really nice to have help and support along the way it is ultimately up to him to make the call.",1611508858.0,2021-01-24 11:20:58,Woolly-hat-taker,"thank you. I know I need to take time to care for myself, but it can be very difficult when I am practically prepared to dedicate my life right now to him getting better if I get to see that.

he does understand it hurts me and I dont thinks he would have an issue with what I've done here as he will most likely never speak to anyone who comments here, and certainly not because of what I've posted. I would make sure he knows everything is ok and that none of you know who he is and whatnot

I will definitely check out that charity. I need to have more of place to vent for myself and seek help personally, because it does really affect me. I'm sure they will be able to help.

he does often say about how he hates that it hurts me and hates that I worry and I understand that but I obviously cant help it. part of me wishes my expression of those feelings would just sort of magically make him get better, as to stop me from suffering, but I know that's not right, wont happen, and is somewhat of a self centred view.

I really hope it diesnt get ti a point where I cant take it anymore and either have to leave or somewhat distance myself from him, and I dont think it will. he has said he wont let it get to that point but from what i can tell he means that more si from the perspective of not telling me about it anymore and hiding if from me. i dont know how that kind of ultimatum (me or the eating disorder) would affect him and I really will try not to let it get to that point. I would word it alot different to that, and not make him feel like he is being selfish or sacrificing me for what's gotten into him, but in a way that is what it feels like. but as I said, I'm seeing improvements and I'm talking with him about how to deal with things and how to still have e a happy and healthy relationship dispite this. so I dont think it will come down to that.

I dont know what else you have to say but even it's nothing, I really appreciate your help. you've offered me alot of great advice and places to go with this. thank you so much :)",1611488108.0,2021-01-24 05:35:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They had also been my best friend for nearly 14 years and we had been engaged for over a year. 

It was a bad breakup. 

However, honestly?? It was probably one of the best times we could've ended it. 
In treatment (especially residential), you (should hopefully) have many people to talk at almost any hour. Not saying you will right away, but having that knowledge alone helps a lot. It took a lot of time for me to talk to the staff about what was going on, but I did get there. 
And there are people to keep you accountable, to help you from slipping too far. I shudder to think about how I would've dealt with that breakup outside of treatment. 

Treatment was really, really hard. And having that happen beforehand only makes it harder. 
But I'm still unbelievably thankful that it happened right before.

I’ve been inpatient, too and it’s really stressful so I completely understand where you’re coming from. 

The main thing about recovery is: 

You have to do it for yourself. 

Don’t try to do it for your family, boyfriend, or job. Because you’re health and life are yours not theirs. 

It’s important that you recover for yourself. 

This is really hard to do. And it’s best not to think of it as “all or nothing”. Recovery is usually going to be a slow, incremental thing that takes time. 

I just hope you know that there are other people here that know what it’s like. 

I know you can recover and I wish you well! 💜",1611407322.0,2021-01-23 07:08:42,sarathedime,"I’ve dated people who give up on me because of my eating disorder. Looking back, they had a lot of their own flaws like commitment issues where they were looking for the perfect woman. One guy, who was actively cheating on me, said I wouldn’t be a good wife and mother because of this. 

There were so many times I thought I was alone or wasn’t good enough. I really loved them because I love deeply. 

I wish I could give you the answer. I wish I could tell you how to recover without support from someone that close. But it’s worth it. You *deserve* it- a life without obsessing over the eating disorder where you can finally relish in the little moments of life.",1611382656.0,2021-01-23 00:17:36,ccctee,"Hey, 

Sorry this is happening. It's definitely not an ideal time but I suppose there's no good time for heartbreak. 

I think it's incredible that you've decided to go to treatment. It's a huge step and a difficult one, I know. It's tough that much of your motivation has come from your partner but, regardless, it's a positive thing that you're pursuing recovery. 

I know it is hard to see now but this will all be for the best. Breakups are SO hard. I remember my last breakup ... It was around the 4yr mark and I was finally commiting to recovery. He had said he wanted me to recover ALL along but I was too scared. Part of me ""couldn't"" recover because I was scared he would leave me when I gained as much weight as I needed to. I thought ""he was attracted to me when he met me at this weight... He can't possibly be attracted to me when I gain 30, 40, 50+ pounds"". This was legit my GREATEST fear at the time. 

So I started recovery. I gained weight. I gained A LOT of weight. It was really hard but I kept going. I was super motivated to change my life and, yes, part of that was related to him and our future together. However, once my weight plateaued a few months later and I was feeling MUCH better (not in terms of body image but in terms of my freedom with food, energy levels, personality, etc.), he decided ""he wasn't in love with me anymore"". You can imagine my anger, shame, disgust. It was so hard - literally my worst nightmare coming true. And it was hard for a long time. 

However, it's two years later now and I can HONESTLY say it's the best thing that ever happened to me. It made me realize that I had MY OWN motivation to recover. It made me realize he was an ass hole if he didn't want me in his life at my healthiest because I am so much better of a person overall when I'm recovered. It made me realize how selfish he was to do that when he did. Now, I look back and I'm so glad he ended it so I could find someone who loved me for my personality and my true strengths, not because I looked a certain way. I also don't know if my recovery could have lasted because our relationship started when I was much under my healthy bodyweight and I don't know that I could have felt attractive to him at a bigger size. I have since found a partner that loves me so much more than that man could have. My current partner thinks I am beautiful, encourages me to eat, loves my soft belly, grabs my bigger bum/thighs with the cutest boyish grin and, most importantly, loves me for my sense of humour, kindness and values. 

I know it may be hard to see now but you will make it through this. You deserve recovery for YOU. If you want to, you'll meet someone who loves you at your healthiest and they will love you for all that you are. If this guy can imagine a life without you in it, and be okay with that, he doesn't deserve any more of your time. Focus on yourself and your recover for now and, I guarantee you, your life will open up to countless opportunities and amazing people/experience. 

Rooting for you, friend ♥️.",1611430300.0,2021-01-23 13:31:40,houston_veronica,"Agree on all the other wise comments here, and wanted to mainly say: this dude would leave for any of the problems that Future You would have. It's not the anorexia...it's him. 
It's okay - not everyone is equipped to be an adult! But there is someone wonderful for you, who will love and appreciate you as you are, will be, or could be. Things are never perfect in any relationship; your own struggle is this ED, but every human has a struggle.Ed's just happen to be more evident on the outside (not always) - so people judge. But never you mind! You are going to be so much stronger, happier and truly ready to live life if you give treatment a true chance. Try your best - take advantage of every single program and moment.  Believe me - you  have so many reasons  to recover. 
PS: It's always possible that the person isn't totally accurate in your BF's plans - it seems odd that they would know his plans, unless you guys are very  young in age-- in which case, it may be even better to be free of any relationships that could weigh you down. Also: you may feel like ED's make you feel lighter or more free, but you are dragging around a huge ball and chain. If you are willing to trust the process, you're going to be feeling light as a feather - free   and full of hope.

Even when I was clearly upset when she would call me fat, she kept calling me that. But one day I broke down to my other sister about my ED and the sister that kept calling me fat happened to overhear. I talked about the toxic mindset that I had, how i started restricting myself, etc. and my sister hasn't called me fat since.

So if you haven't done this already, maybe tell your mom the impact her comments have on you and what it's like to struggle through disordered eating. I've learned that people cannot read your mind and if they have a glimpse of what it's like to struggle through this, they may understand.

It's a really difficult conversation to have but if gently explaining why those comments are not helpful doesn't work and your mom or anyone else continues to say this stuff then you have to get somewhat aggressive and tell her/them that YOUR BODY is not up for conversation. If there is concerns about your overall health that can be discussed but not this. I have had to do this with my mother after many failed conversations of why those remarks were harmful to my recovery. If you are seeing a therapist or dietitian for your eating disorder then it may be time that they have a conversation with your mom at least. You also can direct your mom and grandmother to NEDA resources if you think they would respond to that. When it comes to your peers you have to get a little defensive and tell them your body ISN'T for comments/conversation.

Then, you guys can state the truths about him and look for things he can stop/start doing for him to start believing in these truths. 

My ED actually stemmed from comments about my body from my sister, so maybe ask him if there is anything you can stop/start saying or doing that will help him achieve a better mindset and help him recover.

Also, I am no means an expert so what may be best is to seek out a therapist that can help him. But of course, talk to him about it beforehand and see if he would be willing to see an expert that will help him recover.

My ED lasted for around 8 years and I hit the exact same plateau. It actually made my ED worse because I was so desperate to keep losing weight. My therapist also explored the idea of me eating more and it terrified me. I’m almost two years into recovery and I still occasionally get terrified of gaining weight. 

I think some level of weight gain is inevitable but everyone is different so I can’t say how much weight you will gain and numbers may be triggering anyway. 

After years of only half committing to eating more I finally plunged and let myself eat. I wasn’t overly excessive but I was working hard to eat food I always avoided and learn to deal with the uncomfortable-ness of it all. I did gain weight but not loads tbh. Once I did this and realised I wasn’t suddenly obese and could enjoy food I started to moderate my diet. Not restriction but like enjoying things in moderation, planning when would be a treat meal for example and I found my weight started to stabilise. 

I have had nearly two years of no anorexic/bulimic habits (maybe 2 or 3 mini relapses in that time) and my weight is stable. I still panic every now and then and am working on that anxiety of gaining weight but I can see that eating hasn’t suddenly made me obese. 

To help with those thoughts I try to see food as fuel so if I overeat a little or feel a bit full I think to myself “wow look at all the nutrients I’ve had to help me on my run tonight” - to clarify I’m not at all endorsing “earning food” or “having to burn calories” I do not believe in that mindset at all but I tweak it to make me think about every way the food is going to benefit me, perhaps my concentration at work will be better or I won’t feel as tired when I see my friends. 

I’m challenging myself to go through a phase where I increase my carbs - this like the above terrifies me and, it’s so cliche, but you just have to trust the process and really stick to the meal plans. 

Make sure you have effective coping mechanisms to help if you get anxious or stressed about any body changes too. I talk to my bf a lot and we have set distractions when I get nervous to calm me down.

I hope some of this is helpful!",1611326506.0,2021-01-22 08:41:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

183,l2lf34,ZLCer,"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry you're having to go through this...and feel like you have to recover on your own. That is the WORST...and I know this from experience.

I just wrote to another person who was going through something similar, and here's what I shared:

""You 100% are not alone! 

You said something very profound that stood out to me most: ""I feel like she just doesn't understand...""

You're absolutely right -- she doesn't understand! She has zero clues how you feel, but I would also bet she's struggled with some type of eating issues herself which is why she's always asking about your weight.

Years after I finally told my mom about the bulimia I'd become best friends with, she let it slip that she ""didn't want to be fat"" when she was pregnant with my sister and never ate. She kept letting me think it was my fault and like I was the only one in the world who'd ever struggled when in fact she basically started it...

...which is why she let me keep thinking it was all me. She didn't know how to help me because she had never gotten help for her own self. She felt so guilty it was SHE who couldn't tag about it because she felt like a failure as a mother. The reality of it was that she was so selfish that she couldn't see past herself to help me.

...but she didn't know any better. Since no one had helped her, she didn't know how to help me.

Knowing what I know now and what I wish I had known then is if I'd had someone to talk to I could have gotten past all the living hell so much faster.

You know how when you rip off a bandaid and you're really afraid to do it because you know it's going to sting for a minute? That's what it's like when you allow yourself to talk to that teacher you trust - it might be scary to walk through that door, but once that person knows your story and your concerns, he or she will know exactly how to help you -- with or without telling your mom.

As terrifying as it might seem, if you can take just that one step to talk to that person you trust, the next step will reveal itself once you're there. The only difference of that next step is that you won't have to take it --or any other steps -- alone ever again.

As a matter of fact, you're already not alone. I'm here for and with you.

...and I can promise you this: If I can get better and have a life I actually enjoy, I know you can too.

I'm so proud of you btw.""

Is there someone you can talk to whom you trust? Please give it a try. You're not supposed to go through this alone, and I promise there's someone who's praying right now for someone to help.

I know I was.",1611364553.0,2021-01-22 19:15:53,Tea-rex-,"I’m so sorry that your parents are not able to understand and aren’t giving you any support. I must say it’s really good that you’ve noticed you are experiencing issues and are actively after help because the sooner EDs or disordered eating is addressed the better for the individual.

I went through something similar as I was a competitive swimmer and developed anorexia and bulimia during this time. Everyone assumed my weight loss was healthy and because I didn’t “look” underweight no one really listened or understood that I needed help. 

When people started to listen they had all these misconceptions about what an ED should look and be like. I found it helpful to find resources and articles online explaining things like, you don’t have to be underweight, over exercising is a form of restriction, it’s not just about being thin but also control and trying to channel your pain through certain actions. I don’t know where you’re based but the UK national ED charity (Beat) has good resources. However they might not help if your parents aren’t prepared to read and understand what you are going through. Beat also has access to online support and therapy groups which could be helpful but everyone is different. 

If your parents don’t understand and keep dismissing you is there any chance you could go to the doctor with a trusted friend or adult? I know this might be hard with the pandemic. It’s really important as a young woman you get your period cycles back on track and a doctor will, rightly, be concerned about this. 

I’m sorry that they aren’t listening and are making this about them. My mum did similar, when I would try explain what was hurting/affecting me she’s turn it round and say that I was calling her a bad mother and was being ungrateful.

184,l2ldte,Fungus666,"I’m underweight and always make sure I eat less than others, because it makes me feel somehow better about myself. It is really toxic for me because even when I’m very hungry I don’t let myself eat more than others. It gives me satisfaction when others tell me “You eat so little! No wonder you’re so small” but I always play it off as in it’s just how I’m built and not an ED. I started eating less than I should because my mum is naturally very thin and when I would eat more than her she would make nasty remarks about it or joke. This eating thing is always a competition for me and it makes me so unhealthy. I don’t “look” anorexic and I don’t go to the extreme but I have an obsession with keeping my thinness. Just be careful with this because it can escalate very quickly. xxx",1611313919.0,2021-01-22 05:11:59,MaryContrary26,"Well yeah, restrictive ED's are competitive by nature. Also hypersensitivity to what other people eat. How do you fight it? I really couldn't until I recovered and my body was well fed. Then  I stopped caring about what other people ate if that helps.",1611319631.0,2021-01-22 06:47:11,edie43,"Yeah, I’ve built up resentment towards my bf because he eats less than me while I’m working on treating my ED. I’m bulimic so I’m not even restricting but it drives me insane.",1611324234.0,2021-01-22 08:03:54,anitacina,"Yes I’ve been there. I reached a point where I couldn’t eat in front of others because I didn’t want to feel “wrong” for eating as often and as much as normal people. 

Your behavior is totally “normal” in your situation. Even when I’m at my best (almost recovered) I still have this habit of eating less than others. I guess you can’t really get over it but you learn it to make it less extreme with time and dedication.",1611325382.0,2021-01-22 08:23:02,highlowletgo,"I struggled with this for a long time when I was in the peak of my ED. I kept a journal for a few months when I was really struggling and so many of the entries are like ""xxxx didn't finish their food etc etc""... it's really hard to deal with, but what helped me was to remember that even if we ate the same things, we would not look the same. Also all of our bodies have different needs so just because I eat one thing doesn't mean I should eat less or healthier. Good luck, I know it is hard.",1611335409.0,2021-01-22 11:10:09,Idrisnite,"I can kinda relate but instead of hate or anger it's pure jealousy and guilt and disgust with myself for not eating even less.

First of all, I'm sorry that you're struggling with this – ED's are super competitive and unfortunately it's a hard mindset to break. I've definitely struggled with this myself, and it's hard, but I would suggest trying not to wait for the affirmations of ""you eat too little"" as you described. When someone *does* eat less than you, try working on recognizing that emotion, but not taking it out on them (they're not doing it because of you! I totally understand how personal it feels but it's up to us to combat that).

Unfortunately, the only way to really get over this is to stop comparing yourself to other people's eating habits, and to work on not restricting. Remember that it's likely that nobody is paying as close attention to their food as you are, they're just eating to satiety. It's really about getting rid of the connotation of ""good"" eating and ""bad"" eating.",1611352376.0,2021-01-22 15:52:56,NameyMcnamerson0003,"Great news is that you are aware of it so you’re already a big step forward. I was bullimic for 14 years so can relate to the envy of others seemingly having more control over themselves around food. Control, gosh darn control is all I wanted and while I still work on this each and every day, I do think I’ve found control for the most part but I was always focusing on the wrong thing, food!

The only thing that’s ever helped me is to LET GO of control. Even the act of letting go is still control in the end. For example, if you’re holding onto a pencil in your hand that’s a choice but you can actively choose to let go of that pencil too. In the end it’s up to me as to whether I decide to let it go or keep holding on. I kept thinking about what I was afraid of, what am I holding onto so tightly? 

For me, I realized that I was afraid of getting fat because it meant my parents would reject me or be disappointed. This is because in all actuality, their love felt conditional to me. I felt I had to be perfect and couldn’t make mistakes (‘get fat’- I know that isn’t a mistake now though). 

To make a long story short, I decided that ‘fuck them’ that’s their issue and I still deserve love no matter what. So I bought a scale and I binged for the 27 millionth time and struggled all night to keep it down, I wanted to accept my action and see the damage. All night the voices came, telling me to purge, that I was a pig, I have no self control. On and on Negative Nancy went and normally I would give in except that first time.

The next day I checked my weight and barely put on a pound. Moving forward I decided to continue trying to forgive myself each time I binged and to just keep it down and try again the next day. My progress wasn’t linear and each time the voice would come Negative Nancy (the ED) and I (another voice I name Positive Polly) would remind her that ‘it’s ok, you’re still worthy of love even if you over eat. If anything, go ahead, eat the donut cuz you know it won’t add a million pounds. Just enjoy it as tho it were your last donut on earth’. Every meal it would be this tennis match in my head but slowly Positive Polly started getting louder and more trustworthy. 

It’s very different for everyone so I can only speak for myself but I think what anyone with an ED has in common are those damn ED rooted voices in our head encouraging us to do whatever behavior it asks of us or makes us feel like shit. Realizing and hearing that Negative Nancy voice helped me learn that I could control the volume and turn it down. It’s never going to go away for me but at least I know when she’s talking instead of Positive Polly.

That was a rant, a purge of words (pun intended lol) but hopefully that can somewhat help to know you’re not alone. Next time your Negative Nancy comes in your head and starts comparing quantities of food, treat that voice like a scared bully and tell them ‘I see you but I got this, I’m allowed to eat however much I want. I am always in control, even if I choose to let go of it. If I let go, it’s because I want to.’ Or something like that.

Sometimes it takes a NegAtive Nancy to help us realize that we can control our minds and it just takes practice to make that Positive Polly voice louder!",1611360648.0,2021-01-22 18:10:48,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

You should be able to reach your own goals without the fear of triggering her. This is her battle, and what you’re doing isn’t bad.

Unfortunately the world is just triggering, whether it's people, internet, celebrities, or even just food packaging - there will always be something to trigger us and make us feel like we can't do it bc it's too hard and it's easier to place the blame elsewhere.

All I can say is that you keep doing what you're doing as long as you are 100% it's healthy and sustainable for you and reassure your SO that you have to do this for yourself and it's not a reflection on them or the way you think they should live or get better.

It may also be able for them to look into resources that can help them cope with triggers and separate themselves from it.",1612400210.0,2021-02-03 18:56:50,tymopa,"One thing people haven't mentioned (and I agree with nearly everything they have said) is that you need to be careful with talking about what and when you are eating and when you are exercising. Also, pointing out what someone else (stranger or otherwise) is or is not eating or doing is equally troublesome. Even the slightest comments are burdensome to someone with an ED because society constantly obsesses over it. My husband is an avid exerciser and he will often come home and tell me how exhausted he is because he worked out so hard. In general, just don't.

I would also refer you to NEDA and read up and possibly ask them some questions. Your partner needs to know that the path she is taking is honored and that all you care about is that she feels mentally and physically strong.

It's not something you can do for her. But it's commendable and very kind that you want to make her journey a bit easier.

You didn't say what eating disordered behaviors and thinking she struggles most with, so my advice is going to be pretty general. I wouldn't talk about calories. Your needs and her needs will be different, so she doesn't need to hear about your calorie or protein goals. I think it's ok for her to know you're working out, but if you want to talk about it, I would emphasize the progress you're making in gaining strength, which is your goal. It's ok to be happy that you doubled your bench press, or whatever goal you're working on. I wouldn't pressure her to go to the gym with you or to workout, which can be hard when you're feeling good about exercising and your gains.

My boyfriend (who've I known for 10 years) is a big gym bunny and going along with him and having him there to show me how to do certain exercises and helping me to plan workouts helped us both. He could see what issues I found most triggering and adapt to them and I didn't feel so self conscious in the gym because I had him to go to if I started to feel overwhelmed or upset by it.

As a general rule too we don't really discuss calories or macros or any of that. We also learnt to be quite blunt with our own goals: he's doing xyz and I am doing abc. We are there to support each other, not compare, and we also listen to each others plans quite objectively.

187,lc0dd8,ismybrainonthefritz,"I can't say I have the answer for you but I have been through therapy (with 3 different therapist and with a nutritionist that specialized in eating disorders - binge eating and bulimia for me).  All of them worked with me on recognizing the ""control"" part of what I was doing.  You said you can ""control"" your eating habits during the day.  For me, that's where a big part of my problem was.  I was trying to be so in ""control"" that I couldn't help but (over)react with a binge.  

I worked on using ""moderation"" during the day - recognizing that no food was a bad food and that the control I was using was not effective.  One of my 'rules' at work was that I never allowed my self to accept any food offered by co-workers (special occasion type stuff like cupcakes, cookies, etc).  My nutritionist said that, anytime I was offered food by a co-worker, I had to say ""Yes"".  I had to take at least one bite of whatever it was.  I had to give myself permission to eat something that I deemed as a 'bad' food.  This helped me stop looking at my nighttime behaviors as a free-for-all on the 'bad' foods.  

Did it help?  Ultimately, yes.  But eating disorders are hard to overcome and bad habits have a way of coming back.  I have always, am currently, and will continue to struggle with food and weight.  It's a fact of my life.

I switched to making sure I had a snack before I left work, and even one on the way home when stuck in traffic. My urge to binge when I got home was sooooo much less when I did this. She encouraged me to have snacks on hand at all times and to snack whenever I got hungry, with no foods considered ‘forbidden’. I do this all the time now and have smaller meals at mealtimes.

191,lbc1rk,CraftsAndSass,"If you haven't read it, The Body Keeps the Score is a good book on trauma which is a common comorbidity with EDs. Also read the Minnesota starvation study, which provides some insight into the nutritional and psychological aspects of EDs.

I was in residential treatment as an adult, and I wish people would understand that self sabotage does not exist. I don't want to make myself feel terrible. I don't want to be so hungry I can't stand up straight. I don't want to have panic attacks several times a day. I engage in behaviors because they are the only thing that makes me feel so amazing for a few minutes. Nothing beats the starvation high. So yeah, I'm not self sabotaging, I'm coping. Face the urges head on: explore what need they meet, how they make us feel, positives and negatives of engaging in behaviors, then explore how to replace the behavior.

Also, no one in res is ready for trauma therapy. There is so much work to do before trauma therapy is safe. There's no reason to rush it; it only causes more bad ""side effects"" of trauma therapy and ultimately, mor urges and ED behaviors. Spend time on preparing for trauma therapy fully. Patients may also not be comfortable doing trauma therapy with a therapist they'll only have for 6, 8, 10 weeks. 

Take our suggestions on group therapy topics. We know what we struggle with. Yes, we need to learn to let go of control and blah blah blah, but if patients keep asking for a certain topic, at least consider covering it. And if you decide not to, explain why. We're still people. We're sick, we have a lot of issues, but we still can identify our needs.

To make the process more comfortable, validation goes a long way. Imposter syndrome is very common, especially among ""high functioning"" individuals, so validating emotions and progress is helpful. Providing explanations for why the program is structured a certain way or has certain rules can help patients better understand their ED, themselves, and others. It's okay to have some lighter groups that are more like community builders or fun activities. It builds morale, especially after difficult meals or groups.

With an ED, when a patient is struggling they are labeled ""non-compliant"", put on contracts or sitters, and threatened with discharge. If a patient is struggling, you need a different way to treat the ED. A person struggling still isn't getting what they need to cope without symptoms and tolerate the distress. It's not a disciplinary issue. 

I'm a teacher and think it's very similar to the idea that if a kid isn't learning, it's not a lack of will. Kids lack skill, not will. My job is to figure out what skill is lacking and help them develop, not tell them they ""aren't trying hard enough.""",1612388628.0,2021-02-03 15:43:48,MaryContrary26,"It might be helpful to think of the ED (voice) as both an abuser and a constant companion who drives the behaviors. The work is finding a way to put space between the person who can't live like this anymore and the relentless thoughts that have become so ingrained that disengaging from them leaves room to feel the painful feelings they've been able to keep at bay by living in a haze and focusing on harmful goals. The struggle is between wanting to recover and being terrified. I mean this has become an identity for most folks and without it who are they?  So what can you do? Help them recognize the ED voice when it takes over,empower the healthy self, model  normal life,  and just have compassion.",1612389483.0,2021-02-03 15:58:03,Frosty-Dragonfruit80,"Understand that it’s so insanely illogical. There will be times when your patients frustrate you; I have an eating disorder and have been inpatient and when I have periods of recovery I look back and think “what the hell”. I suddenly can’t understand anymore and other people’s behaviors become very bothersome. So I guess what I’m trying to say is- understand it’s irrational, try and be sympathetic but don’t get caught up in patients games, do some reading (the body keeps the score is amazing) and try and focus on the “why” and not so much just the food intake and meal plans.",1612361034.0,2021-02-03 08:03:54,HubbyHasBlueBalls,"I went to residential treatment and it did soooooo much harm that I genuinely wish I had never gone.  It literally made everything worse instead of better. So, I don't have a whole lot about what was helpful, but I can highlight things I needed.

1. Don't forget we are human beings no different or less than you.  Treatment itself is already incredibly degrading, please be aware and try not to make it worse.  You are stripped of everything and have little to no way of really protecting or defending yourself.  Someone's request for little things mean a lot.  If I have to beg numerous employees for something as basic as a hairbrush or to go to the bathroom, it becomes devestating and the message that you aren't seen as a human being starts to hit home.  I know ya'll are busy, but put yourself in our shoes once in awhile.  Things that feel unimportant become really important when you have literally nothing.
2. The quiet ones need your help and support just as much, if not more, than the ones who make a seen or seek out support.  As an abuse survivor, my immediate response is to hide and push away because people feel dangerous.  I needed someone to sit with me, even if I might not be able to engage right away.
3. Trauma informed care is REALLY, REALLY important. Don't just assume that your treatment center trained you fully (if at all) in TIC or that they are actually providing a trauma informed setting. This is where my residential treatment center really messed up.  Not providing TIC to trauma clients is guaranteed to do harm and long term make things worse instead of better.
4. You're adult clients are going to have different needs than younger clients. Treat them accordingly.  In terms of trauma, residential treatment might provide the very first environment that is truly safe for adolescents.  For adults, the first time ever feeling safe was when they moved out of their parents house or away from an abusive spouse.  Coming back into a setting where they a locked in and lose autonomy is going to be very triggering.  It's important that treatment professionals are cognizant of this and react accordingly.  Turning your head and ignoring isn't acceptable.",1612392348.0,2021-02-03 16:45:48,thanksfortalking,"I've never been in residential treatment, only counselling. I recovered absolutely on my own the first time, but I relapse frequently. (Yes, recovering on your own is a thing to some extent.) But here are some tips anyways, just based on how I hear counsellors, people in my life, the media, and other people who have struggled talk about eating disorders: 

1. No one was absolutely happy before having an ED. (It's more like people could ignore that I was unhappy before I had an ED.) It's not like physically recovering from an ED will make you happy. It exists for a reason. If you treat people like they're recovered on the inside because they're weight restored, you are triggering them. If big changes aren't made in their life or big traumas healed or something, that recovery either isn't gonna last or is gonna become a different issue instead. 

2. Not everyone with an ED has BDD. Some of us know what we look like, and some of us are even fine with what we look like.

3. This is a chronic illness. Taking away power or doing dehumanizing things with the excuse that you're protecting the person... This is usually a long term kind of thing. Doing something harmful to keep us safe in the short term if actually selfish. You're having less people die in front of you just so more people can die afterwards but at least you don't have to see it. (Sorry, there might be a better way to explain this.)

4. The whole, ""You need to be weight restored before you can recover in your mind,"" thing is less of a factor than your superiors will tell you. It can be possible to minimize distress to some extent during the weight restoration process, and you should try. Also, anorexics have on average higher IQs, not lower, so we can afford to starve off a few brain cells and still learn new things. Of course there are extremes though.

What you said about not being ready for trauma work makes so much sense to me now that you explain that! I just got a copy of The Body Keeps Score because of your recommendation. I’ve also seen many clients read it here at work, and I think I could personally benefit from it as well. Thank you so much for your detailed response. I really do love my job, and want to be better at it in any way possible.",1612993862.0,2021-02-10 15:51:02,thanksfortalking,"So much this!

Also, I've had a nutritionist tell me to keep a food diary and it was a BAAAD idea. I'll go out on a limb to say that's not a good idea for a doctor to request of anyone at all who has or had an ED before, but I could be wrong.",1612485207.0,2021-02-04 18:33:27,hazymissdaisy,"I love how you explained this! I agree, I don’t really understand how utilizing “contracts” is helpful. Unfortunately, I’m not at a high enough position here to have a say in that, but I try to keep in mind what you’ve said and explain to others that this is a sickness like any other and we can not blame clients for not improving by our specific methods. Thank you so much for your reply!",1612993991.0,2021-02-10 15:53:11,hazymissdaisy,"Thank you for this response. I’ve been thinking a lot about the first point you made, and I think it’s helped me to better understand some of the clients here. If you don’t mind me asking, how can I enforce rules that may feel “degrading” to clients in the least harmful way possible? I’m not in a super high position here, so I don’t make the rules, I just have to enforce them. Lately I’ve been met with a lot of resistance from adults clients about having to keep certain items “secured” in a closet. I’ve gotten the impression that our facility may be a little more strict than others. Your comment has helped me to better understand that it may not be that they’re particularly upset about not having constant access to their face wash, but that it’s more about feeling like they have been striped of all control. Is there a way I can still enforce the rules and keep them safe without making them feel like I’m trying to punish or upset them? I feel like just acknowledging how they may be feeling could go a long way, but I’d love to hear your thoughts on this! Thank you so much for your comment!",1612994350.0,2021-02-10 15:59:10,hazymissdaisy,"Hi, OP here! Thank you for your answer!

I ended up just lying on mine anyway, or I'd binge and forget what I had. I get that it forces the patient to see the logic, but EDs aren't logical, so not a great way to treat them.",1612490103.0,2021-02-04 19:55:03,HubbyHasBlueBalls,"Acknowledgement and validation is very helpful.  It's absolutely frustrating as an adult to go from being a kindergarten teacher trusted with 25 students every day, taking care of my own children, running a home, to then be placed in a center where I'm no longer trusted with a butter knife.  (head's up,,,,I wouldn't have done anything wrong with the stupid butter knife). It's honestly not even about control honestly, it's just feeling dehumanized after awhile. If you see someone really struggle emotionally after enforcing a rule, it would mean a lot to check in on them and give them space to talk about it. I'd say other than that, consistency is really helpful.  The treatment center I went to constantly changed rules, staff couldn't keep up with it all, so it translated into always feeling like something was being taken away from you or you were always in some sort of trouble.  When you have so little that is already allowed, and that gets stripped too, it doesn't feel like help or support, it feels degrading. The only other big thing I would say is enforce rules equally on everyone.  I had one TA who constantly singled me out, and I'd always be in trouble with.  Her words were, ""I really challenged her eating disorder"".  She didn't, she absolutely put me in PTSD hell though.  She was a constant reminder that I didn't have or deserve a voice, and she could do to me whatever the hell she wanted. Don't do this.  You have no idea what your patients case histories are and what you might be triggering, not to mention many places insist on treating the ED first. So all the PTSD stuff she was triggering wasn't addressed or dealt with by my team.  I was left to deal with the flashbacks and panic attacks it caused all on my own, and by the end I was absolutely drowning in it.

One last thing, try to reframe ED behavior.  In treatment it was dealt with as if my eating disorder was unacceptable and bad.  It made me feel as though I was bad and deserved to be punished (which meant that treatment itself felt like a punishment and treatment providers were the punishers). What helped most was my outpatient therapist telling me that my ED had served a purpose and was a coping skill that got me through a very difficult time in my life.  In a way, my ED saved my life.  But now, my situation was different and my ED wasn't helpful like it was before.  I needed to learn different coping skills that would help me where I was at in my life now. This reframing really helped a lot, and it might help some patients to frame it this way towards them.",1613006300.0,2021-02-10 19:18:20,thanksfortalking,"Okay! So I would mean things like any kind of forced treatment without any kind of options of what it looks like, having to ask permission and having your bathroom time monitored for an older patient, infantilizing conversations, etc. I think I was a little harsh in that point but I think you probably get the idea that it is a balance between treatment for short term survival and treatment that makes long-term recovery more likely.",1613061552.0,2021-02-11 10:39:12,hazymissdaisy,"Yeah, I always try to acknowledge how hard it is for the clients to go from being independent adults to coming to our facility. I know I would be frustrated too, I grew up going to strict schools and never did well with rules in general so I can totally empathize with that in a sense. I think the consistency is a big thing at our facility as well. We’re unfortunately super understaffed right now, so room checks can be very inconsistent. I can see both staff and clients becoming extremely frustrated with it, and I am as well. I wish I could so more to help with the situation, but I am often left feeling powerless in some ways. Reframing the ED is such a good way of explaining it. I always try to remind people that treatment shouldn’t feel like or be a punishment. I think it’s just been very hard for me to strike a healthy balance with the clients. I’m not a very confrontational or authoritative personality, so having to enforce rules that may seem trivial and can be upsetting clients has been really hard to get used to. At first I kind of just avoided it, but when I was too lenient I noticed people would try to push my boundaries more often. So I guess now I’m just struggling to find a way to enforce the rules while still being a source of comfort and support for the clients. I guess the truth is I can never avoid upsetting everyone, but I appreciate you taking the time to answer me because your guidance will definitely help me do my best. Is there anything else you’d like to add?",1613016517.0,2021-02-10 22:08:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

193,lbc0we,enord11400,"First try to take care of your physical health as best you can. Drink electrolyte beverages like pedialyte and try to think of them like medicine. This won’t protect the rest of your body though. If you notice any irregularities in your heartbeat or any fainting then go to the emergency room 

Next try to focus on delaying the behavior. If you eat something and immediately feel like you have to make yourself sick, try to focus on waiting 5 minutes or even 1 minute. You can build up a tolerance to those uncomfortable feelings. It’s hard and it may take awhile. Keep trying to build up this time and if you can’t make it then forgive yourself but really try your best to go longer the next time. You could also try spreading out your eating to lower spikes in fullness if that is a trigger for you. Also try not to drink fluids with meals as they also increase fullness substantially. 

If you can, try to tell your fiancé you need some extra support after meals. You don’t even have to divulge what has been going on if you don’t want to, but know that secrets can make things worse. 

Lastly get some extra support from professionals. If you don’t have a treatment team or at least a therapist then you should try to get one. 

Behaviors like this can get really dangerous when things spike up like this and you need to try and lessen them however you can.

194,lbbz9d,Person-324,"I completely understand this feeling and what has helped me are 2 thing: liquid calories, and portioning. Liquid calories such as smoothies and meal replacements can supplement your meals to ensure you are getting enough nutrition on the days you don't think you can eat a lot, but don't think of using them as a first response. If I have too many days of liquid calories it is more difficult for my body to get back into the habit of digesting solid food so I make sure I still eat _something_ every day. What I call portioning isn't like portion control, it's more like putting out as much food as you need (a portion) and keeping it around you. If I'm only able to eat 3 bites I eat that much and keep the food nearby so I am reminded ""hey you have some food here to eat, and it's not more than you can manage"" and keep nibbling it until it's gone.

If she's not ready to get help, forcing her to and outing her to your parents is going to make things much much worse for her. All you can do is encourage her as much as you can. Don't comment on her weight, body, food she eats/doesn't eat, but whenever you see her skipping meals, get small snack for yourself and nonchalantly asks if she wants a bite. Don't push her, but the gesture is nice. Maybe compliment her outfit some days, again not her body.",1612333193.0,2021-02-03 00:19:53,Ev_Do_,"It must be super tough seeing a loved one going through an ED.

I think having a conversation with her is actually a good idea. While it's scary and confrontational and might suck, letting her know you see her struggling (you can just say struggling with food- maybe not that you suspect her of purging... especially when you may not have hard evidence) and that you care about her, is so important. It's a tough kind of love- but is the kind of love that is needed for someone who is struggling with an ED. Make sure that you let her know you love her, support her, and that you want to see her thriving in a healthy & happy way. Maybe writing her a letter would be easer than face-to-face convo? That's up to you. If she opens up to you, you should ask her if she wants support or how you could help.

 I think other ways to be supportive would be seeing if she wants to do an activity with you after meals- could be going for a walk, playing a game... BUT don't press it too hard if she refuses & may be going off on her own to purge- ultimately she is her own person and will make her own choices. Nobody really wants to make themselves throw up and have their heads in the toilet after meals... I can guarantee she's judging herself already. Its a shitty place to be in- the compulsion to binge & purge and then the regret & shame that comes from it. Overall, I think showing general support without judgement is essential- unconditional love for sure.",1612393071.0,2021-02-03 16:57:51,Lsmitty2,"You have such a wonderful heart to be so concerned about your sister, even though you say that you are not very close. This is a great time to begin to build a close relationship with your sister, so that you have some ability to influence her and for her to gain some trust with you.

If she is not ready to get help, there isn't much you can do other than what other people have already posted. You may want to study and learn about eating disorders yourself and perhaps there are ways that you can share some of you learn (informally) with her. Read books and articles. Listen to podcasts.  You can also talk honestly with your parents about your concern and see if they have the same concerns. Perhaps, as a family you can come up with a strategy to help your sister.

198,lbbxvl,thanksfortalking,"Everyone is different, but here are some things I, in general, wouldn't want to hear (There are exceptions):

-any talk at all about weight

-words like fat or skinny applied to literally anyone

-asking her for food tips (other than making something taste good)

-suggestions that I should eat healthier (you might mean this as eating more, but a person with an ED might take this to mean that they eat too much junk or too much in general)

-calling foods healthy or unhealthy in general (How healthy foods are is relative. So for instance, cake is more healthy than eating celery if someone is malnourished and does not have diabetes)

-criticizing yourself for anything remotely body, food, or ED related (ex. saying you ate too much, saying you ""shouldn't have eaten that,"" saying you hate how your body looks because you'd rather look like X, saying you don't exercise enough)

-ever telling her if you missed a meal, unless it would be super obvious if you didn't say it anyways. (EDs can involve a lot of comparison. For instance, if you missed lunch, even if it was because you were busy, she might feel terrible that she ate lunch, and then skip or throw up dinner, and then breakfast and lunch the next day.) For this same reason, you might want to be careful how you talk about other people who have EDs, if you even have to at all.

-anything that dismisses just how difficult EDs can be. There are two main types of this. One category would be something like, ""Why don't you just eat a hamburger,"" which makes it sound like it's easy to just eat a normal amount and keep it down, and that she's lazy or stupid for not doing it. The other type is comparing problems in your life to her ED in an attempt to relate. So for instance, if you said, ""I understand what you're going through because I have depression/anxiety,"" that would be absolutely wrong. People who suffer from EDs usually also already struggle with multiple intense traumas or mental illnesses, which contributed to the development of their ED in the first place. You, on your worst day, might not be hurting as much as she is on her best day, so don't try to compare.

I understand that you're just seeing her at this point. But if things ever get super serious and you care a lot about her, spend most of your time together, maybe live together, etc., you'll both probably feel comfortable enough for you to ask her specifically what not to say. That would be a lot better because these things can be somewhat personal and her triggers may vary. Further, once you're that serious, you should consider making some sacrifices for her health beyond just what you say. Something has got to give, and it shouldn't be her life. For instance, you might consider not weighing any food when you're together, or if you live together you probably shouldn't have a food scale at all. I'm not a body builder, but I imagine there are ways to gain muscle mass without that.",1612317528.0,2021-02-02 19:58:48,RoutineRabbit500,"Hi there; after struggling with several different kinds of eating disorders over the course of several years, I've heard many of my friends and family members ask me a similar question. From what you're describing, it sounds like she suffers from restricting behaviors (I don't know enough about her situation to say for sure because there's many types of eating disorders and some have overlapping symptoms; I'm not a psychologist and can't diagnose someone. So, the advice I'm giving you comes specifically from the experience of anorexia and food restriction).

First, I would emphasize that you should ask her about this at some point (if she's not comfortable with it now, maybe wait until ya'll have been dating longer). Every person's eating disorder is different, and the only way to know for sure what she needs is to ask her. If she asked you to not mention calories, then she's probably open to talking more about what helps her and what doesn't. Asking her what you should refrain from talking about or what you can do to support her will show her that you care for her mental health and physical well-being, and that you're up for supporting her during recovery.

For me, whenever someone around me comments on their own weight, weighs food, talks about calories, or even jokes about how much they ate, it immediately makes me feel too anxious to eat, and I get the urge to start restricting again (or to binge eat). I don't know your girlfriend's full story or situation, but I would say that any weighing of food, talking about calories, or even saying ""I need to watch what I'm eating"" could be extremely triggering and potentially dangerous.

My boyfriend does several things which help keep me from relapsing, and I thought I'd share them with you in case it's helpful: When we plan meals together, he never mentions how much fat/calories/unhealthy/carbs etc. there are in whatever we're going to eat. If he wants to eat healthy one week, he might just say ""Oooh we could add some broccoli to this pasta, want to?"" or ""I really liked when you made that butternut squash, let's do that again!"" It's always framed as a positive ""let's have fun cooking"" thing, and never about the calories. He notices when I skip meals, and brings me a snack so that I ""won't get hangry and can focus better"". Sometimes I'll eat one meal a day and say I'm not hungry enough to eat dinner. He'll always encourage me to come eat with him, and joke around about how he wants me to get ""big and strong"" so I can pick him up like he picks me up, or say that ""you're a cutie when you've got hot chocolate on your face"" or something. Lastly, when I eat, having people talk about stressful things or comment on the food (i.e. ""We need to talk"" or ""ugughh this is so good') is a serious trigger, and he knows that, so we'll normally eat quietly, or he'll show me memes and it'll distract me from feeling bad about eating. Everyone is different, so what works for me may not work for your girlfriend; for example, explicitly saying to someone ""you should eat"" can be very triggering for some people.

Sorry for the long reply! Good luck.",1612317744.0,2021-02-02 20:02:24,I_hate_me_lol,"I'm glad that you are paying attention and respecting her. please just refrain from engaging or starting any talk about food or exercise. numbers in exercise. or food. or weight. and please for the love of god when you're around her dont comment on her OR anybody else's body ""oh my god, that girl is sooo fat. or oh my gosh that girl is super skinny."" just like. don't. thanks.",1612390865.0,2021-02-03 16:21:05,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

I was in recovery when we met and slowly over time I’ve relapsed worse then I ever have in my life. It’s not his fault of course, but he is super triggering. 

Him not wanting to eat what I eat because it’s not good for his gains, saying this has too much fat or too many carbs, constantly talking about new diets or what to cut out or increase in his meals... cheat days... going to the gym. Following women on social media who have specific body types... asking me how he looks, if he looks cut, less bloated, whatever. even just needing to eat so many times per day or certain amounts of protein etc. 

It’s going to be extremely difficult because what I am experiencing right now is just that what he needs to maintain his health and fitness is so different from what I need to maintain my health and fitness, and they clash. He needs to follow strict diets. And I can’t even have a whiff of that in my life. I need to just eat what I want when I want otherwise I’m not going to eat at all. 

I don’t mean to sound negative. You seem very supportive and I can tell your heart is in such a good place. But just know this is never going to go away for her and there are constant triggers everywhere, and your food habits are going to be another one. Just try to remain understanding and supportive and compassionate towards her. 

And honestly, I know you shouldn’t let someone else dictate your life or food choices, but sometimes, if she suggest something like getting takeout or ice cream or having a bagel together, whatever... please just go along with it and don’t make it a thing. I have found myself afraid to even suggest any food ever because of times I’ve been told he doesn’t want that because of fitness related reasons.

Even as someone who has been in the process of recovery for over four years it would be extremely, extremely difficult for me to be around someone who counted calories, exercised a lot, weighed my food, etc. I would feel like I need to be doing the same thing, as the above poster said, eating disorders can be so comparative and competitive. I would also, despite best intentions, assume you were judging me if I wasn’t eating/tracking the same way as you. I am 100% not saying you two are not compatible, I just personally thrive in certain environments. 

My boyfriend of over a year had never had any experience (knowingly) with people who have eating disorders. He’s learned a lot, but is still figuring out my triggers despite my best intentions to be open and honest. It’s hard. My emotional regulation isn’t the best (I numbed out via eating disorder for a very long time) and we’ve argued a bit just based on the way he’s worded things and I’ve taken offense or my ED has taken it as a personal attack, even if by no means did he mean it that way.

You said smth that sparked a question. So even if you go to therapy and recover, do you still have the triggers?

That can only help may be a temporary.Figure out what you can do after meals so she won't go to the bathroom like watching a funny television show or movie, arts and crafts. If she wants to be smaller health way is going for a walk.

You don't want to confront her because that can make things worse for her. Let your daughter open up to you with her feelings, and if she does not make progress with your support within a short time, encourage professional therapy. It may also be appropriate for you (my friends mom and dad did it, it helped them) to seek out professional advice or a support group for help with their own feelings of frustration and helplessness.

As hard as this all sounds, family therapy  can help one of the most successful methods of overcoming eating disorders. With better communication, increased self-knowledge and mutual acceptance. LOVE LOVE LOVE her and let her know you are there for her try different things and take her mind off the bathroom after a two hours after meals because your food digest like 30 to 1 hour to digest. I hope that I could help you   Oh this helped me I taken lipstick and wrote on the bathroom mirror I am not the mirror  no I would not do that but if you see her looking in the mirror or trying to see the tape go around her. say this ""You are not the mirror or the tape your beauty is more than that"". say things that are uplifting here is a song that helped me  I given you the lyrics because this song because this song helped me but  I know my friends it made it worse so some people are different hope I could help a little and love her from someone that had a ED to someone that has a loved one that going threw a hard time I am here for you

**Scars To Your Beautiful""** [Alessia Cara](https://www.azlyrics.com/a/alessiacara.html)

She just wants to be beautiful  
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits  
She craves attention, she praises an image  
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor  
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining  
Deeper than the eyes can find it  
Maybe we have made her blind  
So she tries to cover up her pain  
And cut her woes away  
'Cause cover-girls don't cry  
After their face is made  
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark  
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are  
And you don't have to change a thing  
The world could change its heart  
No scars to your beautiful  
We're stars and we're beautiful  
And you don't have to change a thing  
The world could change its heart  
No scars to your beautiful  
We're stars and we're beautiful  
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving  
You know, ""Cover-girls eat nothing""  
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""  
""What's a little bit of hunger?""  
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away  
She don't see her perfect  
She don't understand she's worth it  
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface  
Ah, oh, ah, ah oh  
So to all the girls that's hurting  
Let me be your mirror  
Help you see a little bit clearer  
The light that shines within  
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark  
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are  
And you don't have to change a thing  
The world could change its heart  
No scars to your beautiful  
We're stars and we're beautiful  
And you don't have to change a thing  
The world could change its heart  
No scars to your beautiful  
We're stars and we're beautiful  
No better you than the you that you are  
(No better you than the you that you are)  
No better life than the life we're living  
(No better life than the life we're living)  
No better time for your shine, you're a star  
(No better time for your shine, you're a star)  
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful  
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark  
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are

I try to focus on the negatives of why I shouldn't relaspe; like how depressed I feel and how I can't take care of others. Your eating disorder will try to trick you with the rose coloured glasses but it will make you miserable. I try and focus on one thing at a time. If I'm not eating, then trying to eat 3 small meals a day. If I'm purging then trying to avoid the triggers. If it is possible, take a break from the people that are bad for your mental health. I also amazed how much proper bedtime/wake up help my eating by encouraging me to eat at traditional meal times. I know things are hard right now but you are capable of figuring this out.",1612185538.0,2021-02-01 07:18:58,None,"Hi. I can relate to the mental obsessing you talked about. I would be consumed w thought about food, eating, weigh & h ou w to control them. I used food to ""fix the way I felt"", to escape, to numb out or entertain myself. I tried enough things to stop the insane eating & thinking, but nothing worked permanently. In my experience I discovered I was beyond human aid. Meaning things that worked for normal eaters would not work for me.  I found out I had a mind that was unmanageable - I could not manage the decision to stop compulsively eating for good & all. How did I kniw this? My experience of trial & error showed me thus. Also, I when I'd start binging or compulsive eating - I'd lose control.  I'd eat way more than intended! I have since got a en recovered by working a 12 step program. Now, I dont struggle around food at all. I can use food for nourishment not ""effect."" I couldn't do this on my own though. I had to have help. I'm happy to chat more if you like. I got well by attending some meetings, I identified w what they said about how they used food, I got a sponsor there & worked the steps. https://www.oabigbooksolutiongroup.org/",1612188571.0,2021-02-01 08:09:31,AutoModerator,"Hello users of /r/EatingDisorders.

As soon as I started snacking on things (mostly healthy) whenever I felt hunger pangs and stopping eating when I no longer felt them, everything changed. I still have meals but they’re very small and surrounded by frequent small snacks. By not every feeling hungry or too full, my brain loses its obsession with food.

204,la1hdx,OneDay95,"Your body is yours. You don’t have to have a child for any reason at all. I also had this fear for a long time and I’m completely fine with it now. I’m almost anti-natal now LOL. The words of wisdom I offer are simple: stop living for other peoples expectations of YOUR life! If pregnancy scares you because of the body changes DONT HAVE A CHILD! There’s never a “bad reason” to not want a kid. Any reason is valid if you don’t want one. Who gives a fuck. Worry about yourself, not the possibility. I will never form an attachment to a child because of my body dysmorphia (ALOOOT of women resent their kids because of this) and so I just don’t want kids. Dont force yourself if you don’t want to go through the changes. Even when you want kids, because theyeir are people who do, it doesn’t mean you want the horrible and “interesting” changes you go through with your body. Please just worry about yourself rather than bringing something else into the world.",1612182494.0,2021-02-01 06:28:14,None,"I'm pretty sure you're supposed to be ""selfish"" with your body, it does belong to you after all.",1612180955.0,2021-02-01 06:02:35,TravelbugRunner,"Don’t let other people try to talk you into having kids just because it’s the “normal thing to do”. 

Some of us aren’t meant to be parents and that should be ok. 

If we have enough insight into ourselves then we should take the route that’s best for us and not one that’s best for someone else. 

I’m not having kids because: 

*I have 4 severe mental illnesses and I’m unable to hold down a job or attend university. 

*I live in poverty and wouldn’t have the financial resources to adequately take care of a kid. 

*I have a personality disorder (Schizoid personality disorder) that makes it difficult for me to be attached to other people. I would probably have very little or no emotional attachment to my child. And that’s really not good. I’d probably be neglectful and I can’t bear the thought of hurting a child in anyway. 

* And I have been suffering with Anorexia purging subtype for 12 years and I don’t really see myself ever really recovering (fully). 
It would probably be hard for me to get pregnant in the first place and then there’s the strong likelihood that my child could also develop learning disabilities, mental illnesses, or eating disorders just like me. 

I don’t want to bring a child into the world knowing that he or she might turn out like me or have a very difficult and miserable life. 

I don’t want to bring a child into the world and then have them crying about how much they wish they were dead. 

I feel that by not having kids I’m saving someone from the difficulties of life and the eventual future of sickness, old age, and death. 

***The above statement is just my own personal opinion.***

There are people who are better suited for parenthood: psychologically, emotionally, and financially. 

And that’s ok, too. 

I just feel like people really need to make sure they know themselves and have a clear sense of their circumstances in order to make the best choice for them. 

The thing to keep in mind is: “Will I be able to take care of this child, have resources necessary for their life, not hurt them, and help them develop into a self sufficient adult?” 

Because that’s the bottom line. It’s not solely about the parents it’s about the future life of a child.",1612192479.0,2021-02-01 09:14:39,cjx888x,"1) The story that you ‘have’ to gain a bunch of weight to carry a child is rooted in myths about the fragility of women during pregnancy, plus a lot of male doctors. Unless you have complications, women *can* eat healthy AND work out pretty much through the entire pregnancy. I know a lot of women who are gym rats, pilates instructors, outdoor-sports enthusiasts, or just other types of act fit folks, who had zero issue with this and who’s body fat was relatively unchanged. The ‘weight’ you ‘have’ to gain is not body fat. The number on the scale has to go up bc of the weight of the baby, and all the other additional expanding tissues/fluids inside your uterus and breasts. Also combined with some swelling, which I hear is super common especially in the hands and face, but could be all over anywhere. But It is absolutely possible to weight the same after giving birth and stopping milk production. 

Yes, you do have to eat more calories, bc your body is basically doing what is essentially having a higher metabolism. Your body will use more calories to grow a baby. So you have to eat more, in the same way a young child needs food while they are growing. It doesn’t mean you ‘have’ to gain body fat. 

2) Don’t have a baby if you don’t want to. For any reason. Any reason is valid. ‘I don’t want the risk of stretch marks’ is valid. ‘I just don’t want a child’ is valid. ‘I work hard to care for my mental health and I don’t want anything that might interrupt that.’ is valid. You don’t ever have to have kids, and any reasons is valid. I am 35, and was surgically sterilized last year after a lifetime of trying to find a doc to do it, because I simply do not want kids and never have!

3) If you long to carry a child but fear for your ED and mental health, find a support group, a therapist, a nutritionist/trainer, whatever you need. A team that can help you set goals and address fears in advance and make a game plan help you keep on track during the process in regards to staying in shape but *also* in regards to monitoring your ED and wellbeing. 

4) If you are torn bc you long for a child but simply don’t want to carry one, adopt or get a surrogate! You don’t have to carry a child, and any reason for not wanting to is valid. Your body, your life, your choice 100%.

5) At the end of the day, your choice about what your want from your body is what matters. You are allowed to have ideas about what you want to look like! Without discounting that: I feel that its still important to say that having your body change during pregnancy is totally ok, and the world loves to spend huge amounts of energy obsessing and scrutinizing over womens bodies and what they look like before/during/after literally *anything*. Our bodies can and will change for so many reasons, and the rest of the world can quite literally fuck off. If what you want is the freedom to feel good about yourself and your body regardless of the way it might change from pregnancy, you should absolutely make space for that. Our culture is obsessed with imagery of women that implies that being young, thin, and actually virginal or otherwise ‘untouched’ by other men, is the only way to be truly attractive. Think about it. Our culture constantly demonizing women looking like anything else.... it freezes the idea of ideal female beauty at an age when we can more easily be imagined as a possession rather than a powerful autonomous being. Childlike but still sexually developed. New and untouched. It’s pretty sick actually. 

Whatever you choose to do- I wish you the best luck!",1612200519.0,2021-02-01 11:28:39,Kikicutie,"(Warning: Possibly triggering for some) 

I have undiagnosed anorexia and when I was pregnant with my latest baby (I have 2 kids now) I was at my lowest emotional state that I had ever been in my life and even rhough I knew that it was possibly hurting my baby by restricting I still couldn't bring myself to meet my essential calorie intake. Everytime I went in for a check up the doctor would freak out about my lack of weight gain and have an ultrasound done. By some miracle my baby boy was completely fine and gaining weight perfectly - but I was still losing weight. I was literally dropping pounds while my baby gained and my overall weight stayed basically the same for the last 2 trimesters of my pregnancy. People where surprised to hear that I was due in a few weeks because I hardly looked pregnant at all. 

I will forever be thankful and guilty that my baby was born healthy with no complications, no thanks to me. He took a bottle as my body couldn't produce enough to breastfeed. This is a mental illness. I know that I will not be having any more kids and my anorexia is the number one reason why. 

It's been a year and a half since then and my body dysphoria is still telling me that I have pregnancy fat to lose even though I KNOW that I hardly gained anything in the first place.

1. I have struggled with anorexia and purging since I was 11. I have been to treatment and I now see a therapist that specializes in ED’s weekly. When my husband and I decided to talk about kids this was my biggest fear. I was (sometimes still can be) obsessed with the numbers and I also didn’t want to look like an awful mom for fearing the inevitable that comes with making a person. 

We started working on preparing my brain for that change for weeks before my husband and I started trying and I am now 32 weeks pregnant. I made sure to eat what I needed to make sure that my baby was getting enough, but I absolutely wasn’t “eating for two” which is kind of a myth. I was in a butt load of prenatal vitamins and continued to see my therapist weekly. 

Yup, some days are hard, especially when I found out I had gestational diabetes and had to start tracking what I was eating. But I MADE SURE to talk to my husband, therapist and midwife about how I was feeling at all times. I’ve stayed healthy during this pregnancy and learnt a lot about recovery and if anything it has made recovery much more meaningful. I continue going to the gym and staying active and i feel great. I kicked this ED’s butt not just for me but for my family and I’m very proud of that. And coming from a very vain place in my head... my body honestly doesn’t look THAT different. I don’t know if it was genetics because my mom stayed small with hers or if it’s just from eating well and working out.

2. If you do not want kids (because of the ED or not) don’t do it. Completely 100% your choice and if it will not make you happy or it will be detrimental to your mental health DO NOT DO IT. Your choice! 

Good luck with everything 💕",1612202981.0,2021-02-01 12:09:41,tokpie21,"I have a ED and was recently pregnant and carried to full term, it effected my life and perception of myself massively, but I found with having the correct support and things, it had helped with not purging and setting yourself a meal plan throughout the pregnancy which helped me and baby. So my body didn't change to much. 

But if you're not ready for a baby and have concerns about being pregnant with a ED it might help talking to a professional who can also offer advice. 

I hope this helps as its from my own experience with pregnancy and having a ED.",1612212221.0,2021-02-01 14:43:41,kizeltine,"I can totally relate in the sense of not wanting to bare a child because you don’t want it to destroy your body. That’s a major reason why I don’t want to have a child. Whether it’s selfish or not so be it because at the end of the day it’s my body and my life. 

Don’t push yourself to have kids if you aren’t ready. And your reasons of not wanting to have kids, or fear of having them, are totally valid because their your reasons. Because it’s your life, your body, you get to be selfish.

The reality is you may never be ready to have a child because of the fear of what it may bring on your body and that’s OK. Because remember, there’s more than one way to have a child in this day and age. Get a surrogate or adopt. In fact, if I were to have a child I’d adopt because why bring in a life when there’s so many children out there already who need the love and support and protection? 

The take away to this is don’t feel bad or guilty. It’s your life and you have the right to be selfish with your body.

I wish I had a concrete answer but when I feel like I'm spiraling I stop everything and focus on what is actually triggering me.

i think you need to prepare for the idea that anything you do or say does have the potential to offend her, to anger her, or to push her away. this is a sensitive subject and because it’s probably a very private part of her, possibly a part of her she doesn’t like, it *may* cause some emotional backlash. 

i sorta live under the philosophy that you can’t help anyone that isn’t ready to be helped. but based on what you’ve said it seems she’s aware of her issue and possibly wants to overcome it. 

if you feel like taking a risk in an effort to help her, maybe start by saying you’ve noticed she seems a bit more down recently and you’ve noticed she hasn’t been eating a lot and that you’re worried for her physical and mental health. then ask if there’s anything you can do to help her feel better. if it’s a no, know that you showing genuine concern for her well-being at least showed her that you care about her & that alone may have been enough to help her in some way that you might not be able to see instantly. 

i think the best ways you can help her in an indirect way is by:

- being vulnerable with her to maybe make her feel safe in becoming vulnerable with you. this would allow for more effective talks in the future. 
- promote her self confidence by saying she looks good in a certain pair of jeans, or dress, or whatever. if there’s something about her not related to her body, maybe compliment them nonchalantly one day. if she has pretty eyes, tell her. maybe it would do her good to know that she is beautiful and that her body doesn’t determine that beauty. 
- encourage more (healthy) caloric intake 
* maybe a way you can encourage a bit more snacking is to buy healthy, light snacks, and make a comment like “hey, i just got these they’re so good do you wanna try them?” examples would be dried fruit chips (they sell them at the dollar store), seasoned nuts, and they have these seaweed chip things at walmart that are 74c/pack. 

with all that said, if her behavior becomes an imminent threat to her physical health, i would say, frankly, screw what her initial reaction *might* be and take action to prevent any further damage but use your own discernment on what approach you should take because you know her life/circumstances better than anyone reading this post.",1612152487.0,2021-01-31 22:08:07,None,"These certainly do sound like hallmark features of disordered eating. I've struggled with disordered eating since before I knew what that was... not to timestamp myself but let's say around 25+  years. 
I can say for sure from expierience that you have a couple things to consider..... like 

is she of a healthy body weight currently? If shes a skeleton that may up the urgency...

Do you think some passive aggressive loving might be helpful for her? Like telling her how amazing she looks and that she shouldn't change a single thing about herself?   Or asking her to be your ""diet buddy"" and doing a 2000c diet together?  I know changing YOUR life for someone else is a nightmare but you could always hit your guilty pleasure(s) when shes not there also.  Another passive thought could be getting you and her the same book about positive self image (or something related) and telling her you're reading it and it's great and you wanted to share it with her, and maybe talk about parts of it together?  Then theres The Betty Ford center online, which is friends and family members of someone suffering with an addiction (which I do believe EDs often are similar to addiction) who can give you tips on how to smoothly and gently start that conversation once you're ready to. 
. 

I will also bring up that you have to LIVE with this girl every day so if things go sideways during a confrontational conversation you'll have THAT gem to look forward to every day and night...   and the event that it does, you'll probably sacrifice your friendship.

I'm fully aware that everyone is different and I have no idea where shes at in her journey but for ME, when I was at the point where I recognized and admitted to myself there was a problem, it was a very fragile time and I recall unleashing hell on anyone who brought my eating into question bc I was ""working on it""...  it usually infuriating that someone was butting into my business, and embarrassing that someone noticed. It didnt feel good.  But it sounds like she IS aware theres an issue and she IS working on it, so that's a plus.

Most of it was in the right head space. One problem was with the clothes. Hearing ""you look good in those jeans/that dress/"" etc could be really bad for mant people with different kinds of EDs. The eyes comment wasn't too bad, but I would keep comments disconnected from weight/bodily appearance as possible. Like, for instance, I would tell someone they're scooby doo converse were great but would never say they ""look great in that shirt"" (too much tie to body). I might say I love the pattern or something, but, not specifically them looking good in that specific clothing piece. Like if I compliment on clothes it tends to be about color/fabric/pattern etc. Tbh compliments about anything physical are not nearly as good as comments about how good she is at conversation, how she knows how to make you laugh, how you're impressed by her knowledge about some topic, how you appreciate her advice or listening skills, etc. Just bringing it to real worth and not appearance based. 

Also the comment of offering a low calorie seaweed snack to share could really enforce already negative behaviors and thought processes (seaweed snacks are like classic ED food, like offering someone shirataki noodles or diet soda to replace a meal or  something). Generally I wouldn't try to push food unless they expressed they want that.

Those and myself included discovered we were powerless over our eating. We might regain control for short periods, but we'd go back to compulsive eating & obsessive control measures despite swearing off. Plus there's the mental obsession around food, eating & weight. If you're open to it maybe check out the phone meeting many of us who've recovered attend as well a newcomers who just want to check it out. Maybe see if it feels right for you. All I can tell you is I thought I was doomed to a life of unhappy obsession w/ weight, food, ect. Now I'm recovered & am free & neutral around all foods. No more mental obsession! There is hope!

And to tell you the truth, it didn't feel relieving after telling them either. I can only tell you that now, after 4 years of recovery, I am so glad that I told my parents that I needed treatment and got the help that I needed. It's still weird with my parents, but I have a therapist and nutritionist that I love and who have gotten me to a better place than I've ever been in.

Adding on weight will allow me to be happier, stronger, faster, and have more energy. Participating in sports at such a low weight can lead to injury for athletes. You can do this",1612103642.0,2021-01-31 08:34:02,steamypeen,"In high school, I was captain of the men’s water polo team and ate SO MUCH FOOD, ALL THE TIME. I felt strong, played really well, and never looked fat in the slightest. 

In college, I started the swim team, developed a restrictive eating disorder with compulsive exercising, and lost a lot of weight, like 30 pounds. I also stopped being able to perform athletically and felt like shit.

For a few years I had the same fear as you and would not allow myself to gain back some weight. Yet, I eventually got fed up, sought out therapy, and started gaining again— trusting that the outcome my ED was saying would happen wasn’t true. Low and behold, I’ve gained 20lbs, feel much better, and do not look fat in the slightest (even if I did WHO CARES because I have energy again).

You gotta trust that your ED is trying to scare you into being underweight. It’s showing you your most feared outcome, not reality.

The fear of fat and weight gain is instilled in us by a culture that profits off of that fear. You’re going to have to learn to stop equating fat with moral and personal failure, because weight and body shape is not something that is in anyone’s control. Once you’ve done this work, and you know that weight or fat gain isn’t a result of some deep personal failure but rather a result of a body doing its job to try to keep you alive, you will feel so much more free in your recovery, and you’ll have much more compassion for others too. 

Lots of good reads to help with this, but something like Anti-Diet by Christy Harrison may be a good place to start, especially if you can’t do therapy right away.",1612186550.0,2021-02-01 07:35:50,shizzymccreepy69,"
I had the same fear when I seriously considered recovering. It definitely takes a lot of work and persistence to change your mindset about what gaining weight really means. For me, ditching the scales permanently was the first step. I have not weighed myself in over a year. I don’t avoid mirrors, I think it’s important to recognise the process visually so it’s less daunting. I began to think of food as something that would either fuel my body to function or something that would just be really delicious to enjoy. Tbh, for the first few months of recovery I baked cookies three times a week and just let myself have at them. Cooking is a nice way to acknowledge all the amazing, nutritious elements of a meal and help you feel more connected to food in a positive way. I can’t tell you you’re not going to gain weight but I can promise you that recovery is the best path you will ever take. I like the way I look more now than I ever did with an ED. And more importantly, I get to live a fulfilling life without constantly feeling terrible mentally, physically and emotionally. Plus, I still fit into all my old clothes - not that it matters and it’s different for everyone, but I’m sure that may be something that could be reassuring to you.",1612355297.0,2021-02-03 06:28:17,tsar_monty,"27m, I've been a competitive cyclist for years, and throughout I've struggled with anorexia. Back in the thick of my disorder, I was competing in races and time trials, but I was performing like absolute garbage. My lizard brain couldn't make the connection that eating 1000kcal while training and racing = no bueno. Being under 110lbs as a 5'9 male is not good from any medical perspective, but strictly from an athletic point of view it's absolutely terrible for performance.

Now I still train, but I eat 3000 and sometimes over 3000kcal without guilt. I'm about 10x better now that I treat my body right by feeding it what it needs to perform at its best. If you look at it from a perspective of eating more will equal better performance, it could help.

If you two aren’t close and you mention signs you’ve seen that indicate she might be indulging in unhealthy behaviors, she might either a) not be struggling with ED and may feel awkward/observed or b) be struggling with ED and not ready to get help, and feeling observed will just make her rely on different, more secretive behaviors.

I hope you know that it’s very kind and admirable that you are noticing these things and want to help. Eating disorders can be very private issues wrapped up in a lot of shame, and if she’s not ready to seek help and has a neutral or negative reaction I hope you don’t take it personally. Also please keep in mind that her recovery is not your responsibility, especially if she’s not ready to get help - I say this not to encourage you to butt out, but to encourage you not to let this become something you see as an obligation. I’ve had loved ones (not just roommates, but people with whom I have close personal relationships) feel like they’re supposed to help me when I’m not ready to help myself, and it’s a stressful situation for everyone.

It might also be good to try and sus out what support she has. If she has friends and family already aware chances are she mightn’t want any more people involved (for me it was incredibly embarrassing to have my roommate commenting on my bulimia).

In my case I’ve had a pattern over the years of going to treatment and letting my body get to a physically healthier state without giving my mind time to catch up. I painfully learned that because I wasn’t trusting the process and learning how to cope mentally through the physically uncomfortable part of getting better that my mind was still sick and eating disordered. This caused me to relapse repeatedly. My last relapse (which will hopefully stay my last) the biggest gift I gave myself was coping differently, in a healthier way and I started to acknowledge eating disordered thoughts I’d have then I’d move on with my day instead of feeding into them. Almost as if to say “okay I hear you eating disorder but today we aren’t doing x, y, or z- today we are doing something different” which may sound silly and that’s not to say I don’t still give into thoughts sometimes but for the most part I know now that I cannot risk my life just for a moment of instant gratification nor am I willing to take that risk. I think recovery is defined by all of the little and big things you do to defy the eating disorder, all of the wins, even the little ones, they all matter and add up. I’ve always been told that once you start recovery it takes at least one year for your brain to fully get on board and for new neural pathways to form. So I think being able to commit to recovery for a year to start is a good way to to figure out what you will end up defining recovery as for yourself. It’s definitely different for everybody but I think the one similarity in everyone’s recovery is that you are actively, every single day, fighting against the eating disorder more than you are given into it until you aren’t giving into it at all. If that makes sense? Good question, it made me think a bit. Apologies for the lengthy reply.",1612249128.0,2021-02-02 00:58:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And even ten years into recovery the nausea and acid is still a thing. If I follow my plan with bananas and oat milk and other anti-acid things it’s much much better. Almond milk used to help as well. Water not so much. Also the antacids didn’t work for me very well but they might be helpful. Also pepto was a lifesaver at times.

I’m really sorry your going through this.  You can learn-what works for you and definitely have a decrease in symptoms.",1612079878.0,2021-01-31 01:57:58,Dickblaster2337,"Hi! Honestly, I’m currently having that nausea which makes me want to eat less:( but I remember when my eating disorder was bad 2 years ago, I started off with small things like apples and cucumbers! I wouldn’t suggest suddenly eating a meal right away since that might cause you to throw up. Start off small and gradually go up. Try to drink some water, even add some fruit/lemon in it:) I don’t have any advice for nausea and not eating normally- all I can say is to try to help with the nausea, trying munching on some ice and make sure you get some rest. I hope you feel better soon! You’re not alone:)",1612099723.0,2021-01-31 07:28:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
