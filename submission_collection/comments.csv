3,ksqyzf,mollai,"maybe watching a movie or listening to song while sitting? or play board games? read something that he likes to him? 

sorry I'm not sure what's his interest but just a few ideas that came to my mind after reading your post. Maybe you can ask him what does he like to do? Maybe chit chat with him, ask him to tell you more about his life (if he likes talking). Sometimes making conversation, you don't really need to say much, he might just need a pair of ears.",1610077520.0,2021-01-07 21:45:20,fc967,Go for a visit--  could also bring your mom as the 3 of you could talk.   Bring food or have something delivered.   Of course find out what he eats so you can make sure to get something he likes..   I sent a bunch of protein that my friend likes--  it was all frozen and she could pull it out as needed.
