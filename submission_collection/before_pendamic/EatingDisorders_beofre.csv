When I finally told my mom at 19, she said “you might have disordered eating, but not an eating disorder”.

I’m about a week in to finally getting help for my binge eating disorder (but I’ve experienced all the other kinds before), and I’m doing well. I haven’t weighed myself in two years. I got a phone call while sitting on the couch at my parents’ from an MRI place for my injured back. They needed to know how much I weighed to make sure I’d fit in the tube. I told them I don’t know, but the lady wouldn’t take that as an answer. Mom said “there’s a scale in my bathroom!” I caved, and weighed myself. It was bad. I cried, and Mom came in. I wasn’t planning on telling her anything, but I did, because she said “I know this is hard for you”, and I said you don’t understand!

Mom doesn’t remember the incident denying my issue. And after she got frustrated when I said “you don’t understand” several times, I just said stuff to make her happy. I realize for certain I can’t rely on my parents for emotional support anymore. Luckily I have an amazing boyfriend.

Any advice as to how to move on from this? I still feel like I’m reeling. I knew I was heavy, but I was shocked. My body feels foreign to me again. I wish I said I didn’t want the MRI instead of going through this.

1,EDPostRequests,1530907839,8wna6m,"Hello there! I don’t often post on reddit but here goes nothing, right? I think I may have some kind of eating disorder, but I have no idea how to identify it. Here is a bit about me first: - I’m a 20 year old female - I am an identical twin and was born very slender

Basically, for the last seven or eight months now I’ve been having a really bad problem. I’m not sure how it evolved, but basically after having fallen sick I developed this really bad fear of throwing up. Originally it was just because I often got heart burn after taking my medication, but the fear grew. I stopped smoking cigarettes (probably for the better, hey?) and stopped drinking alcohol completely due to this irrational fear, but it’s only gotten worse. At one point, I was so worried about throwing up that I didn’t eat. I was worried that anything I ate might be a cause for throwing off. This resulted in me eating - no joke - a couple of chips or a slice of bread a day. To me, the grumbling of my stomach was a good thing because it meant I had nothing to throw up. Obviously this diet caused ALOT of weight loss, and so I went from being slender to looking anorexic. No hate for anyone suffering from anorexia - it is a real problem and I can’t imagine how hard it would be for anyone going through it. But, yeah. I am certain this isn’t anorexia, but given my thin state I am constantly asked about it regardless. I’ll admit I’ve gotten a little better over the past few months. I’ve been eating a little more, however I only ever eat one meal a day still (dinner) because I worry that I’ll get too full otherwise. Please help me out here! I’d appreciate advice, feedback, the works. If you have any ideas on where else I might be able to post this that would be greatly appreciated too.

4,EDPostRequests,1530869596,8wiqkk,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to ask; I'm not the most knowledgeable on eating disorders. My brother, for a while now, has been forcibly throwing up on a daily basis. I have confronted him about this multiple times, asking him why he does it to which he replied (and heavily insisted) that it was the easiest and most logical method to losing weight/not gaining weight. I tried to suggest that there were other healthier ways to do this to which he responded similarly. He insists that because it is effective and that he doesn't throw up everything so he is still eating that I and our parents don't need to worry. But I'm worrying ): He also mentioned that because it is so effective he can eat more. I feel there may be more underlying problems I'm not aware of and also that this may damage his health. He seems to avoid directly answering questions and brushes us off as if it's nothing to worry about. I'm not at all certain, but he may have bulimia. Take that with a grain of salt though; again I am not the most knowledgeable about ED. How can I help him? Am I just over worrying like he says? Is what he is doing damaging his health? What should I do?

Just some further context below.

He did wrestling for 2 years and was pretty good, but an aspect of the sport was that it was optimal to lose as much weight as (healthily?) possible to be put into a certain weight class as a strategy to go against smaller people. I know he would not eat or drink water at least an entire day before weigh ins and I have a feeling he may have picked up vomiting as a method for losing weight from back then. This was earlier winter/spring this year. He has since stopped wrestling now that we've graduated and he is not planning on picking it back up I believe.

He has had severe depression in the past, to which he has told me he is over and was largely linked to societal/family expectations having to do with mostly school. I'm thinking he maybe has picked up these habits as a coping mechanism for stress, but am unsure.

My family is very blunt and will often comment on our weight and appearance. They would tell us, ""You need to lose weight. You're getting fat"" and similar things. They do it because they want the best for us and love us, but this may have damaged his confidence in his image.

I will be straight forward. He did wrestling and his build matches very well. He actually is very well built and I know most girls he ever talks to are interested in him. (Since he was severely depressed before he is very kind to everyone regardless of who they are and often strikes up conversation with anyone so to the outside world there seems to be nothing wrong as it looks as if he has many friends. He has told me though that he actually has no friends). Despite his build he is always wearing baggy clothes as if he is hiding his body, even when it is incredibly hot outside. This may or may not just be his preference in clothes so I do not know if this information is relevant. He has told me, however, that he feels safe when he wears his jacket.

That's about it. I'm willing to answer any questions. I just want some direction :)",Request: I'm Concerned About My Brother's Eating Habits.

5,EDPostRequests,1530750288,8w6adp,"I’ve been bulimic for about 3 years. I’m really tired of this and have wanted to change for awhile. So many times I find myself binging even though I’m not hungry and don’t want to at all. I often start crying as I’m purging and all that and I’m really looking to change, but I just feel so trapped in this constant cycle. Whenever I try to change and try to eat normally I of course, start gaining weight.

I’m not really skinny. I’m definitely considered a healthy weight right now for my height and I know that I’m not fat by any means, but I can’t help but dislike my body and the way I look. I remember when I reached that once (when I was at my worst? I guess you could say) I was still unhappy with the way I looked.

I want to change and I know I HAVE to change because this is surely no way to live. I just have no idea how. I feel so trapped and I feel like a lot of the times when I started getting better, I just catch myself doing it out of habit (like I feel like I have the strong self will to stop, but just do it cause I can and get a joy from eating so I just do it anyways).

I don’t really feel like I can see a counselor about this. My mom is not one who really believes in mental illnesses and therapy. My mom even knew at a time that I was bulimic and confronted me about it once to stop, but after that confrontation we both pretended like it never happened and was not a problem anymore. I really do think now though that she has believed it to stop, since I haven’t been as skinny as I was during that time for awhile.

I struggled with anorexia for years, and I was hospitalized in 2016 because my health had deteriorated so much. I stopped going to therapy and stopped seeing doctors/the dietician about 6 months ago. I want to figure this out without professional help because I feel like my experience in therapy and with doctors was traumatizing for me.

I'm generally very happy now, and my body image is usually good, but when people make comments about how I look or my weight, I am usually so surprised. Of course I still have insecure moments or even insecure days. But the main thing is that I feel like I am so much bigger than most people, even when I can see that I'm not. I'm taller than most women I know and even just see when I'm out in public, and it makes me feel like taller = fatter. Even if a woman is short and ""looks"" like she is overweight, I still feel like I look bigger than her.

I'm also generally shocked when I find out how much I weigh. The last time I weighed myself, the number was significantly lower than what I thought it would be. It's a healthy weight for my height; but I was certain that the number would be within my ""scary range."" This was a while ago and I don't know where the scale currently is. I look the same now as I did then, but I still get thoughts telling me ""you've probably gained 5-10 pounds.""

Lastly, I just assume sometimes that people think I'm fat, but then they call me skinny. This week my boyfriend picked me up then commented that I am ""really tiny."" I was surprised because even though I logically know he doesn't at all, I worried that he was secretly thinking I'm fat.

14,EDPostRequests,1531089117,8x5ehc,"Some background info; I'm twenty years old, Norwegian, and a single mother of a seven month old baby girl. I struggled with bulimia and was moderately underweight from the ages of 14-16.

Lately, as in the last two years or so, I've been having issues with eating. I don't fear eating, and I don't think I'm fat, but I'll either eat way too much or way too little, and it's gotten worse the last five months.

When I got pregnant with my daughter, I got myself on a healthy food regime and followed that closely. It's not like I would only eat healthy, but I made sure to always eat proper meals at proper times.

As a single mother, I don't really have much time to cook, so I've been living off of easy-to-cook meals, or pre-cooked microwave meals. Some days I'll cook a full dinner - with salad and everything - but those days are few and far between. Most days I eat one meal and maybe some snacks here and there. I also drink around twenty cups of coffee a day, which keeps me feeling sort of full.

It's only been seven months since my baby was born, and I'm already weighing less than I did before I got pregnant.

The last two weeks or so, whenever I eat, no matter how hungry I am, I will only manage half a meal before I feel like I'm dying due to the stomach pains caused by eating too much.

My boyfriend - not my baby's father - is worried and would probably feed me himself if he had the chance to do so, but as he lives halfway across the world, he can't. I'm also starting to worry that I might be falling back into old habits without meaning to.

I know I wanted to lose the baby weight, but I also knew that it would take some time and that that is perfectly normal, but maybe my want to lose weight was stronger than I thought? I'm pretty confident in my body, but maybe not as much as I thought I was.

I feel so full after every meal that I want to go make myself throw up so I won't have to deal with the fullness, and I'm worried that some day soon I will.

My therapist says that everyone thinks about food a lot and I just need to prepare for meals and eat when I’m hungry. This may be true but I’m not sure, so I’d like some insight. 

I for sure used to have an eating disorder. I don’t know if it was anorexia or what you could call it... Basically I didn’t eat all day and then come home, get super stoned, and eat unhealthy shit. I am 26 years old, 5’6” female. This started because I was so anxious I would get a lump in my throat and be unable to swallow, even if I wanted to. (This still happens occasionally, especially in public.) for a long time I really wanted to eat but I physically couldn’t a lot of the time. I would gag on my food and have to spit it out so I started avoiding eating in general but especially around others. Then I started losing weight. I was over weight in June of 2016 and had just gone through a pretty intense breakup. I lost a lot of weight in a short period of time. 

When I started losing weight I was excited about it plus I was super anxious and depressed so it eventually changed from “I can’t eat” to “I don’t want to eat.” I moved back in with my parents in September 2017 because I was having a very hard time with my mental health. When I moved I made a commitment to myself to eat three meals a day, and that went well for a while. Now I’m back to avoiding eating, even when I’m hungry, and the occasional gagging on my food. It’s not nearly as bad as it was, but it’s not good. I’m not malnourished, but I’m losing weight again. I get really anxious about eating in general, both about what I’m going to eat, if I’m going to gag, gaining the weight back, and so on. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know where to turn. 

Anorexia doesn’t feel like the right diagnosis but then idk what it might be. Plus my therapist doesn’t think it’s an issue so maybe it’s not! I’m just feel really confused. It doesn’t feel like it’s a big enough problem for me to need help, but it’s a struggle for me. 
I like to eat. I like food, I’m adventurous with food. When I eat something I really like I even have a “happy food dance.” I considered myself a foodie before all of this started.

I am conducting research in an effort to further understanding about binge eating, and am particularly interested in how emotional experiences in childhood might related to binge eating in later life.

I am currently seeking participants for my research, so if you would like to participate within this study, please access the survey at the link below. The survey should take approximately 40-50 minutes to complete. All responses are completely anonymous and confidential.

18,EDPostRequests,1532128831,90ksvn,"I hope this is a valid  submission. I am fairly underweight and always was. I eat kid portions,  cant finish an entire kebab, cant finish a medium sized pizza in one  sitting, am content with one average sized bowl of curry etc.

Im a guy and honestly I wish I was buff and could gain weight, but it  seems impossible. I just wish I wouldnt have to eat, its like im not  interested in food even though a lot of it tastes very good. My mother  thinks im simply too lazy, and that its just very bad habits. It has  always been like that though (I remember my kindergarten teacher trying  to shovel spoons in my mouth). After years and different people trying  to get me to gain weight, she has given up and just frowns when I visit  and I dont finish the food she cooks. Its like I have this stubborn  unwillingness to feed myself. I could go without eating an entire day, I  would just eventually feel cold and maybe have a bit of a grumble in my  stomach, but not more. I would tell myself to get something to eat now,  because I know I really should, but I dont really care for it, dont  really want to but will reluctantly- essentially I am just not hungry.  Often I just cant be fucked to cook something, even though I dont even  mind cooking and have all the ingredients at home, other times people  literally put food in front of me and I just reject it for reasons i  dont understand. I like eating alone though and prefer that to other  people being there and *watching* me, so maybe that has something  to do with it. I mean people tried to force me to eat all my life, but  likewise I have had this condition all my life (I was born prematurely  and was a very picky kid). 

People have told me I look like a holocaust survivor or gollum or  something whenever I take my shirt off, so obviously I wish I could  change it. I went to the gym for a while, drank weight gainers, protein  shakes as well as trying to eat properly and regularly and only ended up  gaining 5kg. I did this for several months and it kinda felt like a  wasted effort.  Likewise if I spend a week at home doing nothing, just  feeding on garbage like cereal or dry bread etc. I dont end up losing  weight either. Its like my body is fixed. It sucks. Ideally I would want  to gain, so that I can work out and gain muscle and look good, but it  sure seems impossible. 

I feel fine, I manage to live with my life like a normal human being,  I am happy and I have accepted the way I am a long time ago. I am not  suicidal or anything. I just don't understand how I can do all the same  things my friends and roommates do whilst eating significantly less than  them.  I dont relate to other people with eating disorders at all. I  have met a couple, they think *I get them* or their mentality or  something, but I don't really. I can only relate to their symptoms I  suppose (like getting a head rush when standing up to quickly, always  freezing etc.) but not to their motivations or other things really. Im  also not hesitant to pick something up to eat quickly on the go etc. I  eat meat, no moral issues or with eating in general. 

Sometimes I have appetite to eat something specific, and Ill go to  great lengths to cook it the way I like, but ill still only eat one  bowl, although I could technically fit another one or at least a little  bit more, I would just have to go to the kitchen and get it. However at  that moment eating is something I am not concerned with anymore, its not  a problem to deal with anymore and of no interest to me. Sometimes if I  really like the food, or if spent a lot of energy (doing a lot of sport  or something equivalent) ill eat until I am truly full though. 

Because of university I try to make myself eat three times a day  because I know it affects my studying in one way or another and I know  that you cant expect a car to race if you dont fuel it adequately. But  thats ultimately the only reason I eat at all. Yes food can taste good,  but I eat because I have to and cant get around it. I actually tried to  sustain on food supplement shakes for a while because I thought that it  would be more convenient than having to eat, it wasnt really an option  though. People ask me if I'm anorexic but I dont puke after eating and I  dont want to be thin. To me it doesnt really matter how you would  classify it. I just know that it's unhealthy and its not what I want, so  what the fuck is wrong with me and how do I fix it?

After that, I developed AN and B/P disorder at the age of 16. I was binging and purging everyday or at least every two days and when I was not doing it, I was starving myself. There was a heavy anorexia period in my life that I was in a cycle of not eating anything (anything at all) for 4 days and b/ping other 3 days and then repeating this.

In that 5 month period, my anxiety got so much worse. I've developed Obsessive-Compulsive Behaviour (checking things over and over again or washing my hands for several times) and serious Health Anxiety (I am googling symptoms and convinced that something is wrong with me). I am always anxious and seriously believe that something terrible is about to happen to me. I actually sit and wait for it. Today, something happened. I was so busy and had to skip two meals and as I get hungry I realised that my brain was not over active and I could calm down and I was not overthinking about every single thing. My anxiety was so much better. So, does anyone go through something like that in recovery? Right now, as I discovered this it is very hard for me to not to starve myself because anxiety is killing me and I was not able to sleep properly for several months.

As a teenager I was still picky, but I started to eat a bit healthier and ate more junk food. My step mom wanted me to be skinny, even going as far as putting a BMI chart on our fridge and highlighting the weight I should be at for my height. So to make everyone happy I started running. I began running once or twice a day from age 11-20.

Now I'm a married adult and I no longer run (bad knee, just never really loved doing it either) and I've gained a lot of weight. Like 50 lbs in 7 years. So I'm about 30-40lbs overweight.

Most of what I eat is junk food. Last month I realized that I was only eating pizza and candy/sweets. I finally made an appointment with a nutritionist and I had to put it all on paper. It's pretty bad.

So we decided to cut way back on sugar. I really tried, and I cut a ton out, but I'm still not completely at goal. To make it worse, after cutting out tons of junk food and eating fruits/veggies and proteins I haven't lost any weight. I'm still hungry all the time so I've been eating fatty foods (fries, cheese, pizza). That's probably why I'm not losing.

I love being active and outside. I just feel like I'm not burning like I did when I ran.

I made a few calls to find a therapist and no one is ""available"" (willing) to take me, which is so discouraging.

For my Master’s dissertation, I’ll investigate the potential association between social emotional functioning in young adults with eating disorder symptoms, and associated help-seeking behaviour. A better understanding of this would be highly valuable in order to increase help-seeking rates for eating disorder symptoms, so that as many people as possible can be helped at an early stage.

Invited participants for the study are females between 18 and 30 years of age, who experience any kind of eating disorder symptoms, of any degree. The data will be collected through the online platform Qualtrics, where interactive digitised tasks exploring social and emotional functioning will be used together with questions regarding eating disorder symptoms, help-seeking behaviour, and social emotional functioning. It is expected that the data collection will take approximately 20-30 minutes. The online tasks and questions can be completed in one session, or be saved and completed over several sessions. All responses will be completely anonymous and confidential. The project has been approved by the ethics committee at the Department of Psychology and Human Development at the Institute of Education, UCL.

I'm a 22 year old male, 6'3"" and have wanted to lose weight for a while now, I've been thinking I was a little bigger than I should've been since High-School but did nothing about until a couple of weeks ago.

Although those around me say I'm nowhere near being fat, I always thought I was. I've always had really low self-esteem.

I started fasting. I go 1-2 days without eating at a time, sometimes without drinking anything and then I will pig out and go back to not eating for a day or two. I never thought I couldn't go without eating for long spurts but I suddenly found I could and it was easier than I thought it would be and I've been continually doing it for 3/4 weeks. I've lost weight and have been pretty happy with it.

However, today I was taking a shower because I was feeling freezing cold and I started feeling a little odd, I got to the point where I couldn't brush my teeth because I felt completely out of it, I got out of the shower and everything went dark, I got extremely dizzy and lightheaded and could feel my heart beating through my chest, I thought I was having a heart attack at first but I knew I hadn't eaten in around 40 hours. So I plodded to the fridge and ate ate a pinch of shredded cheese and I felt a lot better.

It gave me quite the scare.

Though I am trying to make a recovery and I'm not restricting like I did in the grip of my disorder, I am still slowly losing weight. My summer job involves a lot of walking and even though I don't want to go back to restricting, I find the idea of gaining weight very distressing. My main anxiety is that once I start gaining weight, I won't stop.

Anyway, the point of this post was that the past couple of months, I've had minor levels of urinary incontinence that have increased especially during the past two weeks. It's mostly stress incontinence; sometimes when I sit down, bend down or stand up, I feel a small release of urine, especially after I have just gone to the bathroom. I can feel it coming but the only thing I can do to control it is avoid doing whatever causes the stress until I can get to a bathroom.

The past few days though, I've wet the bed several times. When I was younger, I dealt with nighttime incontinence and couldn't hold it through the night until I was about 12. The past couple of mornings, I've woken up wet. I'm worried because soon I'm going to visit a friend and I don't want anything to happen while I'm there or during the six hour flight. It only occurred to me this morning it may be a side effect of my eating issues. I was reading a couple articles that said it's common but not widely reported (unless asked) in those who do or have suffered from AN.

I’m on hormones now and feeling better about my body because of it, but I still struggle with not wanting to gain fat, while also fighting hunger.

I started doing intermittent fasting and pushing my meals back, eventually until I was only eating one meal a day.

I think there’s some health merits to intermittent fasting, but to be honest I miss breakfast.

I lift weights and I want to gain muscle. But I’m scared to eat more because on other fitness forums I see guys way, way bigger than me eating the same amount I’m eating, or even LESS, and claiming to actually be gaining weight, which is baffling to me.

But really, I just don’t understand calories or eating anymore. I weigh and track all of my food. I feel like I can’t stop eating until I’m bursting, like there’s no grey area, just black or white.

35,EDPostRequests,1533287465,9481sz,"Someone very close to me (long time friend/coworker) has been struggling with an eating disorder for many years. It wasn't something that she shared with anyone until about four months ago. I always knew something was wrong and knew she struggled with her mental/physical health, but, I had no idea of the specifics.

It's really bad. She initially came out to me about it when she decided to get help. She started a partial hospitalization program. She entered the program and was in it for over a month. They called it EDNOS with purging. She seemed to be doing really well and was very open to me during that time about her struggles and her successes. I was so relieved she was starting to get help for something that was so serious. Her mindset was what really gave me hope during that time. She never used to be so honest about everything, and admitted to how often she felt she had to lie to me. I was really optimistic that many things in her life could now start to improve.

After a conflict in scheduling, she had to withdraw from the program and said she'd continue trying to make progress on her own. I could immediately tell that she didn't have much conviction behind that statement. It hasn't gone so well. Not only did she start getting worse but she also stopped sharing as much with other people. She doesn't deny her struggles but no longer talks about it, trying to sweep it back under the rug like she'd done for almost a decade. The thing is, now that I know what to look for, I see her struggling daily. She often purges after meals and thinks nobody notices. I notice. The subtle behaviors are obvious after I knew what to look for (not speaking until she's had a drink, constantly clearing her throat, her voice, immediately popping multiple pieces of gum or breath mints, look of guilt/discomfort all over her face, trying to immediately force casual conversation with everyone around her as to not draw suspicion, etc).

I haven't openly confront her about the purging because the setting is usually around other people and I don't want to cause her any additional shame or discomfort so I just play along like everything's fine (though I must look silently devastated every time). However, I don't know how to approach her and say that I'm noticing how bad she's doing without offending her or risking her going directly to denial which was her old strategy. Since the cat's been out of the bag, I can tell she almost regrets sharing so much because she can't take it back. She's talked about how she would purge and how she'd lie to cover herself. I can tell she doesn't want to confront the issue and would rather nobody notice. But I notice everyday and it's killing me.

I feel like she's really hurting herself by working twice as hard at her jobs to try and distract herself and other people from the more important issue of her mental and physical well-being. I try to start conversations about it vaguely and tactfully and she typically says something about how nice I am for checking in then quickly tries to dance around the subject. I don't think she realizes I know she's purging again. What should I do? I feel like I'm just standing there watching her be incredibly self destructive while she's says things like: ""I'm fine, I'm just tired, I didn't get much sleep last night, I just ate earlier, I'm doing...*okay*.""

She's so busy all the time, she has more on her plate then anyone else I know. I'm afraid she's working herself to death. She wouldn't even know what to do with free time if she had any. She'd find more work to do. She isn't sleeping well, isn't drinking enough water, isn't eating enough, purging almost daily (just from what I can see). It's obvious she isn't well and I don't know what to do. She's an adult and will do what she'll do. I told her back when she first let me know how bad she was struggling that I would never try to force her to do anything but would always be there for support. I just feel so powerless and want to help, but I also don't want to force the issue and risk her pulling away and regressing further. Sorry for the ranting. What should I do? I can't solve her problems but I can't just watch her do this to herself while almost everyone else around her thinks she's just fine.",Request: Advice about confronting a friend with a severe ED,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/9481sz/request_advice_about_confronting_a_friend_with_a/,1533309065.0,2018-08-03 04:11:05

She has been tacitly supportive - but I can feel a distance growing and the absence of warmth is often felt. I'm not faulting her for that. I understand that she has her own life, and I'd hate to ever be a burden to someone who is - other than her bulimic husband - absolutely killing it in life.

As a man, I cannot fathom telling any of my friends about this - even my closest friends. I'm also the only guy in my out patient program and I definitely feel a, ""why is he here"" vibe. Almost like I'm intruding upon a space I shouldn't be in.

43,EDPostRequests,1532857952,92tqg2,"Hi guys,

My (21m) girlfriend (23f) suffers with BED. She has had a really rough past few months with our final year at college, but we've come through it really strong. We had some issues and she was going through one of her rougher patches.

I know she is ready to make a change, she has already planted the thought in her head. She said she wanted to get a personal trainer, but I don't know if that is possible due to our post graduation, unemployed state.

How can I motivate her to start losing weight and going to the gym? This is not due to me being unhappy with the way she looks, as I think she's beautiful all the time. This is simply due to health and confidence reasons- i would love nothing more for my girlfriend to feel confident with herself, and live a healthy (healthier) lifestyle.

Can anyone give me some advise? I would love to go to the gym with her to push and motivate her but I don't think she would feel confident or comfortable with that at the moment.

Thanks!
