It has been really difficult because her family does not seem to understand that what she is dealing with is actually dangerous. They chalk it up to just her being moody. So I am the only one who stays on top of her making sure she eats. But lately it has gotten worse. She used to love to cook, and eat, and she loves food. She has always been small, and relatively skinny, I dont think she has ever been over 110 lbs. Yet she sees herself as too fat now, and hates her body. She has severe anxiety and sometimes believes that I dont love her because she thinks there is no possible way for me to actually love her since she is so ugly in her own mind. It used to be that she would try to just eat really healthy and constantly excercise. She used to have some days where she wasn't as bad, or not bad at all, and could actually eat well. She doesn't have good days anymore. She fluctuates between being completely exhausted and depressed because of malnutrition and anxiety, and being angry at me for trying to get her to eat, to sobbing because she doesn't want to die and she feels like there is some part of her that is trying to kill her. She didn't want to drink water today because she was afraid it would make her bloated. It is almost impossible for me to get her to eat more than 1000 calories per day. It is a daily struggle and I don't see this getting easier soon. I am worried because I leave for school in a month and a half, but I am not sure that in that time her condition could improve to the point where I would feel comfortable not being around her.

I have a 23 year history with AN &amp; have been in all sorts of treatment centres, clinics &amp; therapy over the years.

Im still scared to eat most of the time, i have never liked the feeling/thought of food in my tummy &amp; i always dread the experience of mealtimes &amp; everything associated with it.

I always feel as if hes judging what i eat though &amp; i feel that i eat to please others but thats another story. The point is, i am eating enough to maintain, i am not severely unhealthy, i am very happy so i just dont understand why i cant let it go. Do you think that i will ever be able to get over it?
