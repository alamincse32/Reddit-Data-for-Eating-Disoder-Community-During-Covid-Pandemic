I didn’t know how bad his cancer was until a few weeks ago when I went to go visit him.  He’s withered away and looks really bad like 80.  I sat with him that day for an hour or two (he can’t really move) and then two days later I took him to a dr appointment.  Today I gave him a months worth of living expenses (he’s not able to work or barely walk).  I gave it to my mom to give to him, but I feel guilty about not doing more.  I think I should go visit but I never know what to say and he speaks mostly Spanish which is not my first language even though I’m fluent but it makes conversations tougher.

11,ismellpanties93,1610058254,ksof5n,16,"I just needed to express my exhaustion and frustration somewhere, so I came here. Apologies for the long rant. 

Ever since I got diagnosed my friends, family, acquaintances, in-laws, etc etc have been randomly messaging me and so on telling me about all these treatment options and supplements I should be trying because iT mIGht cUrE My cAnCEr. Everything from “cancer cells feeds on sugar” to “this completely random substance found in ancient Egyptian bark has had positive effect on mice”. I even got a book in the mail named “a cancer free kitchen”. 

I don’t at all judge people who don’t want to go the conventional road, who would rather want to explore options outside western medicine and so on, and I’ve met a lot of those patients. Good for them, good for you. However I am very happy with my team - my oncologist is amazing and my nurse maybe even more amazing and I haven’t disagreed with them a day in my cancer life. Some of these suggestions I have ran past them and they’ve told me it’s either bullshit or that I already have a treatment plan that is looking very good right now. My shrink also tells me that these things can create a lot more stress for me than if I just get to focus on my path. And it IS stressful, I feel somehow obligated to sift through pages and pages of medical terms that I don’t understand for treatment options that I most of the time find out is irrelevant to my exact type of cancer, won’t work because it’s just made up, or any other reason. I even deleted social media partly because of all the ridiculous things I got sent by people I don’t even want to share my private life with this way. 

Usually I just say thank you to these types of suggestions and leave it at that. I don’t bring it up again and I never get angry for people to address it either. I am a very young terminal patient so I understand that people are grasping for a solution for me to get better (or cured) so I never want to make anyone feel bad for trying to improve my life. I’ve always thought that at least they might feel better after sharing these thoughts/ discoveries with me. And that I have come to terms with dying, but I don’t think that the people around me have, so that probably makes things harder for them as well. 

But today my best friend in the whole world won’t let this stupid study go. He’s messaged me multiple articles over the past few weeks and he keeps urging me to “look into it”. He KNOWS how I feel about this stuff, better than almost any other person. The first time I said thank you. The second time I said I haven’t looked into it, no, but thank you anyway. Now he’s asking again and it’s really pissing me off! I just opened the article and I already feel the anger just building - there’s lots of insane medical terms and there hasn’t even been a clinical trial on humans yet. I just feel so angry. I have enough with my treatment already, I have side effects and I never ever go a day or even a few hours forgetting that I’m deadly sick. I just don’t want this too. I hate having cancer. Fuck this shit. Bleh.

My dad has EGFR NSCLC turned small cell lung cancer. He is on Lurbinectedin which is his third line chemo and his last ""good"" option. The remaining options have very high toxicity and don't perform well. It sort of feels wrong that all we're doing is acting like all will be fine just like the first 12 months when his disease was kept at bay. I wonder if things will feel better if he asked us to help him cross large items off his bucket list or engaged us in how he wants to best spend his remaining time. (Estate is all taken care of)  

However, he has been the type to not want to know just how much time is left. Since the beginning, he has not asked for how long the drugs are expected to remain effective. Recently, he wanted to know what options he has this current (last) line of treatment but then changed his mind when the day before seeing the doctor.

Two years ago on Roblox (yes, I know), I met someone I’ll call G.  G was (is still) a very cool person.  She was funny, sweet, smart, liked my sense of humor, found enjoyment in a lot of things I did, we were essentially like 98.9% compatible with each other.  

We fell out of contact due to what I would learn to be her needing to cut herself off of social media for a project of hers.  But, the project came to an end around January 1st last year.  Around a year ago.

We simply had fun, talked, wrote stories together (we’re into cooperative writing) and simply tried to enjoy our year.

Then COVID happened and ruined it all.

But, we tried to make the best of it.  It was probably around this time she learned about her cancer.  She didn’t tell me for another month but I could sense something was wrong.  But she eventually did tell me in April, but told me that it would be fine since Chemo was going well, and that she was mainly just going through mental challenges with it, which is definitely understandable as it was persistent.

Then, in June, she had to get her vocal chords removed, as the tumors had spread to that area and were making it hard for her to breathe. 

Recovery from the surgery started shortly after and I thought the worst of the cancer was over.  But, it wasn’t.  On July 12, she told me her doctors recommended stopping treatment since the cancer was too persistent and the chemo wasn’t doing enough.  

She’s just barely hanging on by this point.  Or she may have passed already, I don’t know.  She told me three days ago that the lady chemo treatment had taken a huge toll on her and that she was sleeping a lot.  

Through it all, though, we still tried to make the best of what we could.  We continued talking, laughing, watching shows together, writing our stories, almost like nothing had happened.  Other friends of hers had essentially ghosted her, especially after she effectively was pronounced terminal, though, she didn’t let that break her stride completely, no matter how much it hurt.  She is strong and truly awesome, I’ll give her that.

I am not ready to say goodbye when her time does come.  I don’t know where she lives and she wouldn’t tell me when I asked if I could come visit, citing she didn’t want me to see her on her last legs, which I will respect since those are her wishes.  

I wrote this because I needed somewhere to talk and because I wanted others to remember her.  She is a beautiful, sweet, caring, kind, and funny person, truthfully.  And I’m glad to have met her.

If you read all of this, thank you so so very much.  I am glad she’ll at least be remembered by more people than just myself.

also not too long ago, she had surgery to remove the lump and then had further radiotherapy 

my family haven’t really spoke about it much, which i can understand because it’s upset us all

now my concern is what if they’re hiding how severe it is from me

because they’re hiding all the bad things from her, and it feels as though they’re hiding the bad things from me

i was doing okay until today when i got upset over it realising what was happening, and then i began researching just a little

If you know anything about Nivolumab please share too. Any comments is welcomed. 

**If you have time to read, here's the original version:**

My mom has been diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer, and things aren't looking good. Here's a quick overview on her journey.

Sept 2020 - Diagnosed with kidney cancer (nephrectomy done), detected metastasis in lungs.

Nov 2020 - Having difficulty in moving around, checked and found metastasis in bones (spine, skull) and lesion found in brain. Did spine surgery to stabilize it. Completed radiotherapy on the few parts of her spine. Started her systemic treatment by taking Pazopanib pills.

Jan 2021 - Condition deteriorated as mom having difficulty in walking even with walking aid, tumor on skull became prominently seen by naked eye (size like a meatball). Did PET scan yesterday, metastasis in liver, pelvic and some other parts of her bone. HOW?!!!

Doctor showed us a comparison on with Nov 2020 scan results, her liver was all fine. How did all these happened in just 2 months???? 

Doctor commented that the cancer cells are extremely aggressive and Pazo is not working fast enough to contain them. She recommended we can try switch to immunology (Nivolumab) before my mom's liver starts to fail. It could be the last bet, and if it works it can probably buy us 6-9 months time with my mom.

We didn't start off with immunology because we couldn't afford it, the cost is 6 times of Pazopanib. Looking at my mom's condition, I am willing to fork out all my savings to place my bet on Nivolumab if my mom is willing to try. I don't want to leave out this treatment option because of financial constrain and she has to give up. But is this the best option? I am worrying that the side effects may take a toll on her. I don't want that after I convince her to disregard the cost and try this, yet she still feel shitty and not any better.

My mom doesn't know about her recent scan results yet, but I want to be prepared with the options we have before breaking the news to her. We need to act fast and come to a decision because we saw how her cancer can do in just a short 2 months.

I just want to tell you all and ask if you could support him. he has made 5 videos on his YouTube channel addressing the situation, and in the newest video he told us that he has to go back to Chemotherapy for another 2 months after he was supposed to be cancer free.

the video tackles alot of very serious things that i will let him explain. if you can, please support him anyway you can, even just a nice comment or message to him would be very helpful. if there is anyone that sees this that knows him personally, please support him and keep him happy.

36,captainahab52,1609974933,krzsyy,1,"I don’t know if it has still hit me that I’m in a position to write this, but my grandfather passed away on New Year’s Day. We’ve been pretty close for most of my life (grew apart a bit as I grew up, but still saw him and talked to him pretty regularly). Extended family / family friends always said whenever they met me that I remind them of my grandfather.

He was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer at the end of February 2020, and lives in a different country so my mom flew over within a few days. Within a week of her getting there, the country put up strict travel restrictions that left no way for us (me / my sister / dad / aunt) to travel there. Restrictions were a bit loosened in June/July, but we decided not to go because COVID was pretty prevalent and we didn’t want to risk infecting him or my grandmother by traveling. I’d video chat my mom almost every day (my grandfather used to be pretty tired while going through chemo, and would get a bit overwhelmed when we’d call, so unfortunately didn’t talk to him as much). He went through multiple rounds of chemo until the doctors stopped the treatments in October/November. He was still doing okay (vitals were steady, but would get tired often and slept for a decent amount of the day), but there weren’t any major signs that the cancer had gotten worse.

Towards the middle of December he started forgetting things more (ex. My parents’ anniversary is in December and he barely realized what that meant even after being reminded, also forgot who my dad was briefly before that). Vitals were still fine, and though we knew it wasn’t a good sign we were still being hopeful I guess. But then we got a call from my mom slightly before midnight on NYE (US time) with the news.

I keep oscillating between feeling nothing and completely breaking down. I’ll go through most of my day normally and something will trigger me and I’ll end up crying for the next hour. Think I’ve broken down at least twice a day since we found out. My grandfather was the pillar of the family – very strong personality and extremely intelligent and respected – what am I supposed to do without his hand on my shoulder?

My mom’s also still there alone with my grandmother. It breaks my heart that we aren’t there to support them through this. There’s still a lot of paperwork and administrative work to be done, and the fact that they have to do it by themselves is too much for me to handle. Spoke with my mom last night and she’s had trouble sleeping through the night, and everything at the apartment just reminds her of him.

Some of my closest friends for years suddenly ghosted me and avoided me as if I had the plague. I know it's Covid season and people have been social distancing, but not one sms or phone call?

I spent a good six months in hospital (five weeks in medically induced coma) and was quite baffled by the lack of communication and empathy of some (I thought) dear friends. 

Others, who were merely acquaintances became close, helped me through this tough time and we've really bonded ever since. 

I just cut off ties with the old friends and you know, I just don't miss them. I'm kind of sad that all the good times we had feel somewhat meaningless now, but I have a feeling the ones I kept and the ones I made during cancer are the better friendships. Those that were meant to be.

Even after going off to separate universities 3 years ago we video called almost every day, he’s the only friend from school I’ve stayed so close with. 

Up until a couple months ago that is, when he was diagnosed. He said it to me as a joke but as a medical student I knew what was coming. He was taking it easy and kept just saying “it is what it is I’ll be ok.” I knew it was my responsibility to tell him that he can’t just “shrug off” chemo, and that it’s a huge deal and it takes a real toll on you. I told him to prepare himself for what’s coming while still hoping for the best. 

I texted him every day since he was diagnosed as he obviously didn’t have times for calls anymore, and I made all our conversations about him even though I was going through a lot too, but I didn’t want to burden him with my problems.

44,HandFantastic6847,1609958597,kru6je,17,"Hello, thanks so much for adding me.

I am a 33 year old female with a son. Not on birth control. Last week,  I noticed some light bleeding on day 11 of my cycle. Prior to this,  my cycle has always been regular/clockwork.  So I went to the hospital to get tested. Before examining me, the gynaecologist indicated bleeding mught be caused by hyperlasia or an infection (endomtrisis). After conducting a scan, the doctor indicated my lining looked fine and wasn't thickend. However, he ordered a D and C after I mentioned my worries of C....

He carried out the D and C straight away (and took samples for testing) but immediately ruled out Hyperlasia on the spot. He seemed confident that the cause of bleeding was an infection.

I spoke to a nurse later to get more information. He mentioned that the tissues extracted from my womb appeared normal etc although this of course would have to be confirmed by the pathologist.

A few days later, I went to a sonographer to get a second look into my uterus. Sonographer said my insides looked fine including ovaries. Fallopian tubes were not visible (which I understand is typical in the absence of any issues). No polyps or massess.

My biopsy results come out next week and i am extremely worried. I would like to have a second child too.

My question is- I know doctors cannot categorically rule out any condition based on physical inspection of tissue. 
  But does the D and C procedure sometimes provide some insight? I guess my question is- what made the doctor change his initial assessment of possible Hyperlasia to no hyperplasia during/right after the D and C? Unfortunately I was so drowsy and so couldn't ask many questions.

I should add that the past 3 months have been incredibly stressful for reasons unrelated to this. I felt suicidal sometimes (unrelated to this). I have also been on a variety of drugs in the past 3 months  (again unrelated). Corticosteriods injected into me and anti-fungal drugs (which has menstrual disorders as an uncommon side effect). 

Trying to stay calm. Hoping that the light bleeding is simply a consequence of stress or a side effect of medication. Ever had a similar experience? Results will be out next week.

My biggest fear as a child, was my mom dying. When she did die, I was forced to face that reality. If I'm honest with myself, I think I'm still processing it. After she died, that anxiety shifted to my own mortality, and what that experience would be like for my own young children. 

Yesterday my Dr's office called to tell my my biopsy was positive for squamous cell carcinoma. I am 36, and my children are only six, four and one. 

So ... How do I do this? 

And ... what comes next? All the office said was that I would get a call about having it removed. Are there any other tests, referrals, or followups that I should anticipate?

My boyfriend (36) was diagnosed with rectal cancer on August 28th. He went into the hospital on September 19th and the surgery went great, and was released on October 14th. Japan has pretty intensive hospital requirements, from my knowledge it is common to be in the hospital this long in Japan. Before surgery, they thought he was stage II, but after the surgery they found it to only be stage I. He's been resting a lot and has a temporary stoma (set to be reversed in February) but at his last check up, on December 28th, they found a tumor in his liver. It's very small, barely visible on the MRI. They're going to remove it and send it off on January 15th to see if it its cancerous or not. I have been trying to do research, if it is cancerous his Rectal cancer would be stage IV A, correct? The doctor told us to prepare for the worst, that if it is cancerous making it the next five years would be rare. 

I know every one reacts differently to treatment, but is it possible to have rectal cancer with liver metastasis, undergo the surgeries and live a long, cancer free life afterwards? What can I do to help him? I am really trying to stay positive whereas he is really, really depressed (rightfully so).

86,randdidnothingwrong,1609819921,kqq8lk,0,"(not my native language so I apologize for any mistakes) 

My cancer started growing when I was around 10 years old. I didn't get the diagnosis until I was 14. The tumor was growing in my foot and it meant a tremendous amount of pain. It got progressively worse over time. I had to stop competing at sports and when I was around 13 I was no longer able to participate at all. Between 14-16 I did chemo, radiation therapy and multiple surgeries. I initially thought that I'd be able to return to sports after treatment, but it turned out that this would be impossible. My foot and lower leg were severely damaged, I was shattering bones in my foot just from walking. My kidneys were permanentally damaged. I was always tired and I became terrible at focusing. 

I was free of cancer when I was 17, but the effects of cancer would stay with me indefinitely. I survived but I'd lost pretty much everything I considered part of my identity. 

My biggest dream has always been to be an athlete. I was pretty good as a kid. Even through the pain I kept competing and I kept winning. I'd always figured I'd be an athlete and if that didn't work out for some reason, I'd join the military or become a firefighter or become a police officer. Mental exhaustion drains me while physical exhaustion has always been the best feeling in the world. 

Unable to do what I wanted to do, I was pretty lost immediately following high school. I took a random industry job. I hated it and I loved it at the same time. It required heavy lifting and constantly being on my feet, but the pain was unbearable. I needed money and the pay was great so I kept at it though. When I'd go to bed I'd be happy that I was still able to use my body for something, but at the same time my foot felt like it was going to blow up. My doctor prescribed a bunch of different opiates. I've always preferred pain over being high so I'd only use it for a couple of days to try it out but I'd always end up quitting.

I kept working there until I was 22, which is when my cancer returned. My leg was amputated shortly thereafter. A positive thing about the amputation was that it was now impossible for me to have pain in my foot. A negative thing about the amputation was the phantom limb pains. My doctors explained that since my foot had been so severely damaged and due to the fact that I'd been in pretty much constant pain for the past decade, the phantom limb pains likely won't go away. 

I'm 25 years old now and the thing about phantom limb pains turned out to be true. I'm always in pain. A good thing is that I've had a lot of practice with pain and while the phantom limb pains do get annoying, they don't inhibit my ability to walk / run. My foot would be in more pain the more I used it, the phantom limb pains are mostly unaffected by physical exertion. 

I've started to work out again which feels great. I've started running aswell. I try to limit myself to 5km at a time since I've been pretty injury prone. The longest I've ran is 12km, which ended up preventing me from running for a couple of months (shin splints suck). While it feels great to be active again after being unable to do any of this stuff for around 15 years, I can't really use it toward something productive. I can't use it to get a job or anything. 

The only thing I want to do with my life has been made impossible and I'm struggling with coping. Up until 2020 I tried not to think about it so much. I didn't want to be a strain on my family so I've remained pretty focused at creating an income and making sure that my mom and dad wouldn't lose money because of me. I own my own apartment and I'm done with the mortgage. I own my own car without any loans. I have no debt and I've tried my best to pay my parents back for everything they helped me with (the hardest part about paying them back is that they refuse my money most of the time). 

Recently I've been feeling pretty miserable. I have no dreams and no goals. I have no passion. Nothing really interests me. I have nothing to aim for since I already have security. I play a lot of video games since my friends like them, but I mostly feel completely uninterested in gaming as a whole. The only thing I genuinely like to do is drinking. It helps with the pain and it lets me shut my mind off. I don't know how to get out of this slump. The more I think about it, the more miserable I become. I've always tried to be a positive person and I always try to make people see the positive side of things, but I really don't know how to shake this feeling. The thing that hurts the most is that for most of my life, I've never really failed. I'm very lucky in that I turn out to be pretty good at pretty much everything I want to do. I feel it in every fibre of my being that I would've been great. As an athelete or in the military or in anything I genuinely felt interested in, I could've been someone. I never failed at any of these things, I was robbed of the opportunity to fail. I was robbed of the opportunity to try. I sometimes think it would've been easier if I'd failed because atleast I'd know then that I wasn't good enough, but to not even get the chance...it kills me.",Difficulties figuring out what to do with my life.,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/kqq8lk/difficulties_figuring_out_what_to_do_with_my_life/,1609837921.0,2021-01-04 22:12:01

95,VeterinarianMedium72,1609800430,kqk2qm,10,"Hi all. First off just wanted to say I hope everyone on this subreddit has the love and support they need to help them get through. 

My boyfriend (age 26) was recently diagnosed with a GIST after going through Papillary Thyroid Cancer less than two years ago. This diagnosis was unexpected, and everything happened so fast. He is going to start oral chemotherapy this week in hope that the GIST will shrink. If it does not work, he will likely need a colostomy bag for the duration of his life due to the placement of the tumor. 

With that, I am seeking words of wisdom/advice on how to support him as well as myself during this time. Basically, how can we get through this together? Also, if anyone has tips or stories related to Gleevec/GISTs, that would be amazing. 

I know it will be a tough process with ups, downs, pain and uncertainty, but I want to provide him with all of the love and support he needs and deserves during this time. I actively work with a therapist to channel my grief during this situation, and support my boyfriend in numerous ways, whether that is going to a doctor’s appt with him, listening to him while he vents, planning fun (covid-friendly) activities to do, etc. I’m really looking for light at the end of the tunnel here, but sometimes just getting through the day is excruciatingly hard; especially when he is going through pain (emotionally or physically).

They took a large skin sample  and this is when the problems started. It seemed to get red around the area and stay that way. She also seems to be in horrible pain even with Tylenol. 

When she started chemo it seemed to get worst. Like the redness and scab area seemed to spread. She had a dentist appointment and showed the dentist in which he seemed horrified and gave her an antibiotic prescription.

Now the doctor is making a house call to her which is something I have never heard of.

My theory is they messed up taking the skin sample and gave her an infection and are now are trying to cover their bases to fix it before she figures it out and sues for malpractice. Perhaps I am being cynical anf the doctor is just being a nice guy, but I have found few sources in chemotherapy looking like an infection.

He's getting a hang of using the bag, he's eating well, and going on walks.

GREAT NEWS- He just got a message from his oncologist that he will NOT be doing any chemo in between now and his next surgery to reconnect. They had told him he would do 3 more rounds and maybe some radiation before the next surgery. I guess it went so well they don't need to do chemo so now he'll just be recovering.

She has a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy tomorrow that will tell us the stage and aggressiveness, and a treatment plan will be developed from that. My dad and Aunt are going with her because I couldn’t get the time off work. She’ll also have an MRI on the 15th to check for bone lesions. 

I’ve never dealt with cancer in my family and in the back of my mind kinda thought it’s never happen to us. I don’t really know what to do. It’s a completely helpless feeling. I spent the first few days feeling like I was in a tunnel, just going through the motions of life but not really present for it. She’s been a trooper though and has been keeping herself busy with flipping antique furniture. I don’t know how she’s acting so strong right now, but I also want her to know that it’s okay to be scared? We’ve never been great at communicating our feelings but this is a life-changing thing and I just want her to feel supported and like she can tell me when she’s feeling scared or tired or nervous or down or anything. 

I’ve also read it can possibly run in families, so I’m wondering if I need to go to the doctor. I’ve had similar issues with anemia that my mom has had recently. I think regardless I need a physical so that I can be healthy for my mom so I can be there if she needs me. 

Any coping mechanisms or ways I can support my mom, what to expect with treatment, etc. would be very helpful.

Mom has been healthy as a horse (70), never hospitalized a day in her life etc...she took a terrible fall down her stairs at Christmas where they discovered she was severely anemic.  So much so they gave her a transfusion and referred her to GI to see if source of bleeding could be found (she had no GI symptoms).

GI decided to do CT scan of pelvis and abdomen and it showed a mesenteric mass (I did not get to read report so no idea on size) that they couldn’t rule out malignancy.  Everything else appeared normal. She has been referred to oncology to oversee the biopsy.

This has all come about since Christmas and is all new and terrifying.   I understand that just because she was referred to Oncology doesn’t necessarily mean it’s cancer,  but I am very afraid of the picture emerging here.  How scared should I be?

123,SmartForARat,1609728813,kpziot,4,"Hi there! I just had my Thyroid removed and it was... Certainly an experience. There was a LOT of pain involved, but I could have avoided a great deal of it if someone, ANYONE, had just told me a few things. That is why I feel compelled to share what I have learned.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone is different so maybe this won't help you or make much of a difference, but it made a world of difference to me. Now this isn't medical advice, and i'm not a doctor or anything like that, but it has been 5 days since the Thyroid removal and I feel kind of giddy almost and just wanted to talk about some of what I learned and what has helped me so that maybe it might help someone else going through it or who is about to go through it.

&amp;#x200B;

So the first thing, and what made the biggest improvement in my quality of life immediately after the surgery was how to minimize the pain of swallowing. Immediately after I woke up from surgery, my overall constant pain level was at about a 2 out of 10, so it wasn't that bad and I felt pretty okay. But when I swallowed the first time, boy, that was ROUGH, every single swallow (to me) was more like a 6 out of 10 or maybe even higher. It was brutal. However, through some experimentation, I figured out a little trick that significantly helped with the pain. Now again, I guess this might vary from person to person, but it 100% worked for me. Anyway, when I tilt my head downward, moving my chin as close to my chest as I felt comfortable doing and held it that way when swallow, the pain was SUBSTANTIALLY lessened.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know exactly why this works, but it was a life saver for me. I could barely sip water because of the horrible pain that came with every sip, but once I figured this out, I was able to drink again as much as I wanted as well as eat without problems. It didn't stop the pain completely, but it made swallowing pain more like a 3 instead of a 6+. I will also add that the size of the swallow also affects pain. Tiny sips gives you less pain that occurs more often (as it takes more swallows to get through a cup of water) but larger sips gives more pain less often. So I suppose you can decide for yourself which way is worth it. I was told I was able to eat normal food whenever I felt like it after the surgery, but if those big swallows are too painful i'd stick to liquids simply because you can make little sips to get through it.

&amp;#x200B;

The second major revelation for me was how to get out of bed. I have horrific sciatica and I cannot stand to sleep on my back, I always sleep on one side or the other.  (and by the way, having that surgery done to me on a flat surface made my sciatica worse than it has ever been in my entire life) I also tend to roll from side to side while sleeping. This whole ordeal led to a LOT of pain for me. Rolling over in place while laying down was very painful and sitting up (like performing a situp using your core was also very painful. The least painful way to sit up (for me) was to stay sideways and using my arm to push myself up to a vertical position. Staying side ways and using the one arm is the best for this. I do not recommend trying to push up using both arms because holding your head up from that angle was significantly more painful than holding it up sideways, if that makes any sense.

&amp;#x200B;

So avoid lifting with your core and instead use your arms.

Avoid lifting with your stomach up or stomach down, instead lift while your torso is facing one side or the other and left with your ARM not your torso.

&amp;#x200B;

As for rolling over, it is still painful for me, even now, 5 days later. I still cannot simply roll over in place without quite a lot of pain. So what I have to do is lift myself up sideways with my arm, as I mentioned above, then turn my torso and lower myself down sideways with the other arm. It takes a lot more overall movement and effort than simply rolling over does, but it is only about 1/10th as painful for me and easily bearable.

&amp;#x200B;

My voice was just a faint whisper right after the surgery and it moved up to a very faint hoarse voice, now its still mostly hoarse but much louder and every once in a while I can say certain sounds at an almost normal sound level, so my voice seems to be recovering pretty well so far. Only 5 days into it so i'm pretty happy with the progress. My constant pain is almost non-existent now and is typically a 0. Swallowing with my method is now painless, swallowing normally still hurts but much less, only at about a 1 or maybe 2. I haven't taken my Oxycodone for 2 days now because I haven't needed it, but i've continued taking my Toradol every 6 hours as prescribed to me because it also helps with swelling. I do have a lump of a swell in my neck, but it hasn't gotten worse since the first day and doesn't affect my ability to breath or swallow.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s been a very difficult 2 years and who knows how much longer I’m gonna be stuck with this illness for or if I’m even gonna survive or not. The first time I had it was the worst though since I didn’t really know what was going on and there were a lot of side effects, I had to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the same day for a few weeks which wasn’t fun at all. By the end of all that they said I was cured and the cancer was gone, so I didn’t have to go to the hospital for a while (other than checkups and a few scans every now and then) so I thought it was all over until I started getting pains in my left shoulder which were quite bad, so I ended up having a full body scan and they ended up finding 5 small tumours in various parts of my body which was even more shocking since I was only feeling pain from the one in my shoulder. But yeah in a way I’m lucky that this time around I haven’t had many side effects so far and the treatment is going well (even though that’s what they were saying last time) but I guess I should just prepare for the worst and hope for the best :).

155,Alethea595,1609550597,konqs0,62,"I'm crying as I type this. I was diagnosed with ocular melanoma Nov 2019, aged 20, a very rare and aggressive cancer that often metastasises to the liver and lungs within 10-15 years.

All of 2020, I was very much in ""survival"" mode, just going through the motions and trying to stay as much in the present as I could, despite having constant thoughts about mortality. With therapy, I got very good at living life by my values.

With the new year, I have suddenly had a bunch of new fears about the future that are gnawing away at me that I have no idea how to deal with.

My partner and I are both 21, just starting our lives together. I'm studying and working, and he's finished his apprenticeship. We've just bought land together and plan to marry soon. He has stuck by my side the whole time, from diagnosis to treatment, and during bad days or weeks when I would spiral into reading about my prognosis. I have asked him so many times, ""why don't you find someone else but minus the health issues and looming premature death,"" or ""why are you staying with me despite the inevitable hurt you're going to experience,"" but he always tells me he loves me and wants to be with me forever, even if it's only till I'm 30 or so.

But I don't want the end to be when I'm only 30. We are just beginning our lives together. I want the certainty of living until I am 80 or 90 with him. I want to see him grow, see where he goes with his career, travel the world, and live out our full lives together until we die of old age.

If my prognosis is accurate, he will be left behind with a house that we built together, with pets we raised together, with friends we made together, and with the past decade full of memories we made together, except from a certain moment onwards, I won't be in the picture anymore.

If he's only 30 or so when I pass, I can't imagine he will be alone until old age, and this is what pains me the most. After I die, he will pick up sort of where we left off but with someone else, in the sense that this new person will already have an established career and a house, maybe children. Our ""together"" will end abruptly because of this cursed stupid cancer, and he will introduce someone else to his life that we built up together, and will continue that life with that someone until the end. Sure, it will be different, but it should still be me in that picture. Instead, she will be the one to watch him grow, watch him progress in life, make memories with him, and take care of him in old age, and I will simply cease to be some distant memory for him. When he's 70 or so, he will have lived his life with this new person for far longer than he will have been with me. I'll be forever young in his mind, some very distant memory from 30 to 40 years ago, and I will have been only part of his life for a very short decade, leaving abruptly while he's still in his prime. 

I may be selfish in my thinking, in that I keep seeing people say they want their partner to be happy after they die, and this means being open to dating again and re-marrying. Of course I want mine to be happy too. But it just feels so unfair and uncomfortable because this is not how it was supposed to happen. I can't be comfortable with the thought he will live longer with someone else than with me, when we essentially began our lives together and planned to grow old together.

Sorry for my rambling but I'm struggling so much to deal with his thought now that I've had it. It's a new worry I've never considered before and I don't know how to cope. If anyone else has been through the same thing, I would really appreciate some words of advice or support.

I feel so futile, just existing until my inevitable early end, filling this gap for my partner until he recovers from my death and finds someone new and continues to live out his existence with that person.

A couple days later he had a MRI and the scan showed he actually had 11 tumours we could see.

The doctors started him on steriods (Dexamethasone) to reduce swelling and he just completed 5 days of radiation yesterday.

A quick summary of her case would be that she has leukemia and underwent a round of chemo in October. Unfortunately hers was an aggressive type which needed a bone marrow transplant. So I gave her the bone marrow on the 25th of November, and it took a particularly long time to graft, almost a whole month. Now, she’s had to fight off multiple infections in the process due to the slow grafting process. Today the doctors say she has 2 clots in her brain that can’t be operated on, because her platelets still aren’t regenerating on their own. 

*Now the question is, how did those clots form without any platelets being produced by the body?* 
*Is there any precedent?*
*And what are possible avenues of treatment if any?*
