1) I'm not a dietitian but really make sure that you always do try and maintain a balanced meal plan. Going a little over every once and awhile isnt terrible but its much better to gain weight with nutritional food. This is something that your outpatient clinic will cover so don't worry about it too much. 

2) This is a massive struggle for me as well. The fear of needing to burn It off can be really taxing. Just need to be clear. Make sure to run these thoughts through your support group/team. I think a balanced meal plan is really the way to go about it. Like a breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack sort of system. Therapy is probably the way to overcome the mindset.

One mindset I changed while recovering is that sweets like cookies were actually healthy for me.

I wish I had the strength to do what you're doing, but I had to go into inpatient/residential to get into my own recovery...

From what I know, you really can't overdo eating after you know your heart and major organs are capable of handling the increase in calories. It sounds like you are well past that first fragile phase, but for any readers, please always use caution and medical care when possible, to avoid potentially going into refeeding syndrome or overtaxing your heart in some way.  

Refeeding syndrome is accompanied by the extreme hunger that many, many patients report. It's your body's natural way of holding on to food that it perceives as fleeting, since it had been starving for so long. Like you, I experience a huge surge of energy after the increase of calories. I get night sweats, and I Also have ""restless legs"", which makes me feel like I could run 20 miles (I don't attempt, it's just the feeling). What I think you should do is:

1. Eat when you can; eat plentifully and with the mindset that you are restoring tissue and muscle. You are.
2. Eat often; I had to eat 6 times a day, and pretty much my whole life was revolving around the ""eat, feel full, feel slightly less full, eat again"" type of situation. It seems to help our bodies become calm and aware that it will be time to eat soon...so no need to hoard and overdo at any one meal.
3. My experience with eating a huge amount of calories is that weight takes time to restore, and that you won't go crazy or go into a negative pattern of behavior (like binge-eating).  There's a big difference between eating for weight restoration vs. bingeing. In the first case, you're doing this for physical restoration; in the latter, it's mindless and numbing, so no comparison between that and eating for recovery.
4. I would not indulge the need to move, if you can help it. SImply put, it's counterproductive to your restoration; if you are trying to weight-restore, cardio activity of any kind will just negate that. It's like pouring food down the drain. ;-)  So definitely try your best to distract...and if you have to move, try doing some deep stretches and holding the stretch, clenching and releasing muscles, and a lot of deep breathing. 

Hope you're doing well now and that you're still fighting like a hero!  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is an amazing call and I'm really glad you made it.

&gt; Sometimes she brings it up and it feels almost like bait. For example she could send me a picture of a few sliced up apples, saying it's what she'll have for lunch.

It could be. It could also be unintentional. She might actually think that's a big lunch, depressingly enough.

""I'm worried about you; are you struggling with food? You don't have to answer, but I want you to know that I'm here for you no matter what and I'd like to talk about it if anything's going on. I don't want to blindside you, but I don't have much experience with this stuff and I'm sorry in advance if there's something I could do or say to make this easier that I'm not doing.""

Not sure how you would want to break this up or if there's anything you'd want to add/change, but that'd be about what I'd say. Hope that helps you brainstorm your approach.

Thank you for doing this for her.",unicorns-n-mermaids,1536288523.0,2018-09-06 21:48:43,"I know you want to help, but you can't help someone who doesn't want help. 

You're doing a great job by being supportive in not making comments about her weight or eating habits etc. During a lot of my struggle with anorexia those comments of ""concern"" were fuel for my eating disorder because it meant that people were noticing what I was eating (huge fear of mine, still have so much trouble eating in front of others because of this even though I'm in a much better though not perfect place) and that I was succeeding in starving myself. For example, friends would tell me that whatever I had for lunch wasn't enough, and like duh I knew it wasn't enough that's why I chose that as my lunch! I think a lot of people thought they were being helpful, but did they really think I would be like oh wow I did not realize that's not a safe eating habit?! But it's hard when she baits you like that, which I also catch myself doing sometimes when I feel like I need to make an excuse for eating something relatively normal as a snack or meal that I usually deem as too filling or fattening. I guess the answer of how to react to that is difficult.....you should definitely offer support, and check in on her occasionally to show you are available and if she mentions something stressful happening to her or any kind of problem, offer to lend an ear if she would like to talk about it. I know it doesn't seem like a lot but that kind of support helps me so much when I start to slip again, even if I don't take them up on it. I would say ONLY bring up her unhealthy eating or weight if you notice that she is a danger to herself aka needs to be checked in to hospital. I know that's so hard, but you're only going to push her away if you try to help before she's ready to accept help. Eating disorders are so difficult because part of me every time I relapse doesn't want to recover, just not yet, just a little longer....because I mistakenly think that I am still in control when really anorexia is calling the shots. So having someone challenge that control by suggesting I have a problem just makes me more defiant. I hope that insight is helpful!

This is a massive good call OP, it sounds like you understand that it is a very sensitive issue, which of course you don't know for sure if you are right about. 

With regards to your partner sending pictures of small amounts of food being meals, it could be that she needs to feel validated for what she eats. Eating disorders can be very wrapped up in ones own perceptions of how/what they *should* be, or how they should look (such as someone suffering from anorexia perpetually believing they are fat etc). Perhaps you could approach the subject by offering to take her out for a meal somewhere, or ordering a pizza for example. If she is uncomfortable about the idea, that could be a way to start a conversation about what makes her uncomfortable about it. If she is up for having half a pizza however, she might be fine.

It is a difficult thing to just bring up out of the blue for sure, another big reply to this post is also really good in suggesting how you could bring it up.

One question I have is how do you know at what point someone is putting themselves in critical danger and should be hospitalized?  And my other question is at what point did you start to want help?  What changed? ",unicorns-n-mermaids,1536554252.0,2018-09-09 23:37:32,"I'm always happy to share about my experience if it can bring understanding or help to others. :) Eating disorders are incredibly difficult because they are a mental illness. Logic doesn't apply to how I think about or make choices with food, especially when I was at my most sick. I was in a completely different reality. 

The tipping point for me was when I reached a point where I was not even really living in this world. My body was so weak from restriction that for about a month where I hit my absolute low I could barely get out of bed or stay awake through a full class period (I was in high school at this time) or hold a conversation. Sometimes I would pass by a mirror and have one of those, oh god who is that?! moments because I just looked so sick and my eyes were so sunken in and just no life there. That's when my miracle kicked in, which is a long story for another time, but basically I narrowly escaped from some serious health consequences that were surely around the corner at that point. Of course it would be ideal to save someone before they ever get that low, and so many of my friends who have survived ED's never got to that place thankfully!!!! But I was so incredibly stubborn that I couldn't stop myself no matter who tried to reach out or why. I think if I had someone near me to give me enough support and love to realize sooner that my life and myself are WORTH living and that I DESERVE to eat then maybe things would have turned around sooner. Who knows. However, if your sister gets to that place and you feel in your heart that their health concerns are serious enough to be life threatening you should absolutely take action to get them medical help. Not just telling them they should go to a doctor, but maybe even taking them to the ER yourself, or getting your parents involved if they are under 18 to be involuntarily admitted, I'm not sure how that process goes exactly but you see what I mean! They might fight it and hate you for it in that moment but you are saving their life. They will see that someday. Stay strong; so many people around me that I loved and that tried to reach out to help me I pushed away in the moment, but now that I'm in a better situation I'm able to make amends. So don't give up if this happens to you. We often push away the people we love the most when we feel like we don't deserve their love. 

I started to want help when an event happened during my lowest low that literally woke me up to the reality I was facing. God used a day of my life in particular, during the absolute lowest of my lows, to yank me out of that place. I know He has a bigger plan for me and He couldn't see me destroy my life this way. It makes me seriously wonder how close I was to losing my life and when I look back and can see in a clearer perspective just how dire those circumstances were, it's seriously a miracle. Anyways, I only started to want help when I was forced to realize the way my life was headed and just how badly I was treating myself. It's like a fog was lifted. I was ready to accept help but slowly at first. It's actually been a process that has taken years but I am trying my best. 4 years after the worst phase of my life at my lowest point with anorexia, I am now able to text a friend that is also recovered when I feel triggered, instead of giving in. I'm not perfect and I still mess up....but the difference is that I'm ready to rely on the support system around me instead of diving headfirst back into my ED. 

Again, all I can say is to stay strong. Offer love and support, pour it out of your heart with everything you have even when your sister fights it or lashes out or refuses to believe you. I think the root of my ED is that I felt like I didn't deserve happiness or love in life so I continued to punish myself, and use the pain inflicted on myself through my ED to take out my frustrations with my surroundings like a coping mechanism. Everyone has a different experience, but just keep that in mind to realize that there is so much more to the eating disorder than wanting to be skinny or whatever bullshit people who haven't been through that assume. Hopefully that can give you more patience and forgiveness when loving your sister while she is struggling. I wish I had had that. ALSO keep an eye out for serious health concerns. It's hard because she needs to want to change before she can change, but eating disorders can be deadly and saving someone's life is always more important than how they might react. AND another thing that has helped so much in my recovery is to have someone who is steps ahead of me in my journey!!!! I have an amazing friend who also suffered from ED and it is so therapeutic to talk to someone who understands because you really don't understand until you've experienced it. There's so much unspoken common knowledge between us and it feels so great to have someone to talk to and encourage me AND to show me that one day I'll be able to quiet the ana thoughts in my head and separate myself from the guilt, fear, and negative emotions that I have around body image and eating. If your sister opens up or reaches out, PLEASE just listen. I hate when people try to say, oh I feel bad about eating a big meal sometimes too.....most girls have some kind of negative thoughts about food or their body but that is absolutely not the same thing as experiencing a mental illness; it makes me feel like my very serious struggle is belittled when friends say these things in response to when I open up in a moment of needing help. Just provide encouragement support and love, and if the conversation happens you could suggest your sister find someone who has gone through an ED and is a couple steps ahead of her in the recovery process (so maybe even me) to relate to and offer encouragement of what worked or works for them when they feel a certain way.

You clearly are exhibiting disordered and unhealthy eating habits. Good luck,JigglyBeef,1536092146.0,2018-09-04 15:15:46,"This could be the start of an ED.  If it helps I kind of had a similar story to you. I can try to give you a quick summary of my history and where I’m at and hopefully it might help you: 

I was a good 20-25 lbs overweight my whole life (my BMI was just directly at overweight) and I wanted so desperately to be at a lower weight, so I started getting into running. That helped me lose 5 or so lbs but I was unhappy at the rate that I was losing weight so along with a string of stressful life events I began not eating very much and  restricting what I ate. It worked and I lost about 20 lbs in 2 or 3 weeks. BUT: what happened was I got to a point where my weight wasn’t coming off anymore. And I started to eat more because I had been starving myself for so long, and sure enough I slowly started gaining back all the weight that I had loss. This sparked a very long, strenuous battle I had with builima and pretty much ruined my life. And during that time none of what I was doing helped me lose weight, I was right back to where I was about 20 lbs over weight, and ultimately led to a very unhealthy, damaging lifestyle. 

I know what you’re probably thinking: if I just starve myself for a few weeks/month then I can lose the weight and be done and go back to normal. But that’s not what happens. There’s a bunch of studies out there that show that after a period of starvation (could be days, weeks, months) your hunger hormones start to kick in and you will eventually binge because you have been keeping your body from eating for so long. 

This post I found in this subreddit helped me the most in recovering from cycles of overeating/undereating: https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/2f0p7y/anorexia_to_binging_its_not_about_will_power_its/?st=JLO4X40I&amp;sh=33ba3e31
 
If it’s any help: I tried all these things (under-eating, builima) and never lost more than a couple of pounds and would always go right back to where I started. I sought help, am now reading the book Brain over Binge, and am actually at my lowest weight and am in the best shape of my life and I am actually eating more than I ever have in the last 5 years (I at least try to get anywhere from 1500-1800 calories a day). I don’t log what I eat anymore and threw my scale trash. I know how scary that sounds, but it is possible. You just need to focus on filling your body up with foods that nourish it and make you feel full. Try looking up articles related to the glycemic index: this really helped me understand why eating what I had been eating wasn’t making me lose weight. 

If you want any more information or have questions about what I’ve commented don’t hesitate to DM me and I’d be happy to discuss anything with you. I didn’t go into much detail about what all happened with me and my ED, but I don’t want anyone else to experience what I had and wish there had been someone back then to tell me what I know now when it comes to eating healthy and how to properly lose weight and maintain the weight loss. 

Again, this is just all my opinion and my experiences, but I definitely have found myself in the same situation as you and had these same feelings at the beginning of my battle with my ED. ",Bot_Metric,1536092150.0,2018-09-04 15:15:50,"25.0 lbs ≈ 11.3 kilograms ^(1 pound ≈ 0.45kg)

You're not going to accidentally develop a full blown eating disorder without any sort of negative thoughts around food/body image/eating etc! Maybe there is something stopping you that you should dig into deeper. Disinterest in food is definitely not an eating disorder on its own, though it is a symptom that some people with ED's might experience. As someone who also takes ADD medication and is recovering from an ED, I can absolutely tell a difference from when sometimes my ADD meds have decreased my appetite and when I'm avoiding food or not able to eat because of the emotional state I'm in at that given moment.

I would bring this up with your doctor who prescribed your medications and even look into seeing a therapist or dietitian who can give you advice about how and what to eat when you're not interested. I have a friend who is in a similar boat, so she drinks Fortsip or protein drinks in the morning and evening in addition to trying to eat throughout the day. 

One thing to consider is whether or not you are beginning to show other symptoms of an eating disorder. I know not everyone who has trouble eating has an eating disorder that can be diagnosed,  but often struggling to eat can eventually develop into a full eating disorder.

For example, those of us with eating disorders can easily trick ourselves into thinking we're not really into the food when we are feeling stressed out or depressed. 

If it turns out there's nothing behind the loss of interest in food, then definitely set some goals around trying new foods. You can even go to the store with a plan of buying items you have never tried before. I agree with the other poster who mentioned eating with a friend. Try new food combinations, different condiments, interesting seasonings, or a variety of sauces. Also try different settings, anything to remove the boredom.

10,9kzom1,MyMorningSun,1538564066.0,2018-10-03 05:54:26,"My weight once fluctuated as much as 10 pounds due to a combo of being on my period, being sick and laying around, and inhaling *tons* of water and chicken soup for three days. Imagine my shock when barely a week later I was back down to my normal weight. What you need to understand is that it *will* fluctuate anyway regardless of those factors. Water retention from a million things. Food you've just ingested or food sitting in your digestive tract somewhere. Water you've just drunk. It's not ""real"" weight, in the sense that it is body fat. This is very easy to obsess over, but it's important to understand that your weight will more than likely reflect a range of a few pounds, rather than just sit at a solid number. Plus, if you've been working out, you should expect to gain some weight from muscle (and yes, water retention as well, which is common after workouts). You only need to check your weight weekly, at the same time in the morning (say, first thing when you wake up Friday morning or something). Daily is excessive, and paired with the need you feel to check it that often is troubling. 

All of your concerns are normal, but the extent to which you have them is not. You have an obsession at this point, and you're right- it *can* develop into a full blown disorder. Figure out why- why is that number so important to you? Try answering honestly for yourself, and then get in counseling or therapy immediately to delve deeper and help you cope with those reasons. Check with your university's health center. Many public universities (if you're in the US, at least- I would assume there are similar resources elsewhere but I wouldn't know) have some free counseling sessions or programs specifically designed to deal with EDs/ED prevention. The good news is that if you go now and be proactive in tackling this early on, you can prevent it from actually getting worse. ",AndyF1069,1538576415.0,2018-10-03 09:20:15,"What was your reason for going to the gym in the first place? That might be the course of your distress right now. 

For your weight, you're focusing too much on numbers. There is something called Body Mass Index (BMI) which is a general way of assessing if somebody is overweight or not based on their height and weight. But doctors make it quite clear that it is not a definitive way to assess if somebody is healthy or not and they specifically make mention of people who exercise regularly because of muscle mass. 

You might be heavier than before, but that is because of the hard work you have put in. I assume your goal was to better yourself from before, for you to be at the gym as frequently and routinely as you are. But you need to take attention away from the numbers. The numbers now don't apply to you in the same way that they did a year ago. You are stronger, fitter and more muscular. It would be the equivalent of giving an eye examination to somebody who just had laser surgery to see if they need glasses or not. 

Work out your reason for going to the gym, and if that goal has been accomplished. If it has, try to reduce the important of the number on the scale. It doesn't have the same negative meaning that it did in December 2017. ",AlcatK,1538577559.0,2018-10-03 09:39:19,"My therapist gave me a challenge to not weigh myself.

Then my dietitian recommended that I continue to not weigh myself and my therapist set a new goal of 1 year for me. About 3 or 4 months in now.

It is distressing sometimes to not know my weight, but the key word here is sometimes! It is not always hard to not know. I would say having support is crucial. The way that you think about weight and scale indicates that talking about it could be helpful. :) Best of luck!",phxgry,1538578716.0,2018-10-03 09:58:36,"You should only look at 2 numbers, per my trainer, to determine progress and overall body composition: body fat percentage and skeletal muscle mass, in addition to before/after/progress photos of yourself.

Then weight/exercise took over my life, I had no friends, and 10 bulimic years later I'm still dealing with eating disorder behaviors. (Have to do this much exercise because I ate \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ or I feel like I weigh too much.) I've gotten better though!

The best thing I did, per the advice of my therapist (exercise addition is a thing, by the way) I stopped working out and running and just simply...lived. Do you know how much time of your day is spent focused around exercise/weight?!

I 'm still ""active"", riding my bike to work and rock climbing, but without the obsession to work out everyday and therefore be hypnotized by a number or reflection. My best advice is to just relax with yourself. Take it easy. Go for a walk with music in the morning. Or not. Whatever! Be gentle with your body. Let yourself be YOU without punishing yourself.

The generally accepted advice is that weighing yourself everyday and obsessing about it is never good, but I get even weirder about my food if I can't weigh ... like restricting heavily to make sure I don't gain in the face of less information.

The one thing that's helped me is an app that tracks my weight and does curve matching. By that, I mean it plots a continuous curve around the scattered points of my data. So my weight may jump up 3 lb, but I can see that the trend hasn't budged, and in fact there are even larger variations in the historical data.

Even if you’re getting healthier physically you could still have a lot of fear and anxiety surrounding food. You don’t want to go through that mental turmoil and pain alone, you want to be understood and supported.  Try talking to those around you about it, they want nothing but the best for you. 

Finally, kick your ED voice in the face and shut it up when it guilts you, when it tells you that food is bad, that calories are evil, that you’re ugly. It does not want you to get better, it is not your friend, and it most definitely NOT your real voice. It’s you and your body VS your ED, remember that.

You know, Ed wants you to feel like you ""suck"" at recovery, so that you'll quietly go back to his open arms. Just say no. Any recovery effort is better and a million times more worthwhile than submitting back to the ED. I know you aren't saying you would do that, but this is how the slope to relapse is so slippery.  Please stay focused on doing the next right thing. If you fall, and we ALL do, brush your little hands and knees off and walk proudly to your next opportunity to eat and show ED that he's weak.

I think it has much to do with mindset.

I’m not here to say, “oh you’ll be fine and you’ll get back to normal, it happens” because you are going through what seems like 2 different things. One of which I explained happened to me but the second is the emotional toll his verbal abuse took on you. I think now that you’ve lost weight by not eating, you’re terrified of maybe even eating and you gaining it all back.

Not many wanna be on a medicine to help them and I understand that too!

For starters I need to address your ex. He clearly is not a great guy, *nobody* sits there making snide comments and comparing a current partner to an ex unless they somehow enjoy waving that power around. My brother used to comment about my being overweight when we were younger,  because he knew he could use it to get to me. I don’t like the idea of you being in a relationship where you feel like you have to do things like sending pictures of salads to appease your partner. It might not feel like it now but you are better off without. Someone like that will find other ways to control you. You are not to blame for him, you are you and you are not perfect, nor can you be, and this is completely fine.

What you describe shows you recognize that things have changed, and you might have a problem. What thoughts, specifically, do you have when you find you cannot eat? Are these thoughts true? Is there evidence to support them? Is there evidence that disproves them..? These things are cyclic in nature, you think bad (“my ex always commented on my stomach...” etc), you feel bad, and then you act bad (not eating etc). If you can alter your thoughts, you can change the direction thereafter. 

For now we have to focus on your day-to-day. Do you have “safe foods”? Things you can eat without issue? How are you getting by each day, 1 meal, 2 meals? Disruption to a routine can happen really quick, but trying hard to restore the routine of 3 meals a day can help keep everything on track while you come to terms with your thoughts. You *can* control your thoughts OP, it is hard and takes practise but I promise that you can. Even if controlling your thoughts means repeating, in your head, over and over “my ex was wrong, he doesn’t define me”. Everything you have said and felt and will say and will feel, is all valid, all of it, but now is the time to unpack it, all of it. Only then can you make peace with it.

I wanted to but I just couldn’t. It was at a point where I had to drink those Boost drinks. My mom would force me to and I wanted to ask butt it was actually so hard because I just couldn’t. I keep saying how “I just couldn’t” because it’s the only way I can explain it. My brother died the 8 months after my ex dumped me. My family had to go to the police station to be questioned to make sure it wasn’t murder basically. When I was there, I got really dizzy and pounding heart (which I get a lot). My mom was screaming and crying while sitting next to me and I couldn’t stand it so I moved to another room. I told the one cop I was dizzy and he got me water asked if I wanted him to call EMS. I said no and asked him to get my dad. I am an EMT and my best friend and her husband are EMTs and they were sitting up front. The cop ended up calling ems and I did decide to go to the ER. I noticed the one girl wasn’t an EMT yet and I was pretty sure she had been at my house that morning when my brother died. I asked if it was her first code/death and she said yes and I was apologizing to her lmao. I’m thankful my first death was a much older man, not a 30 year old. I’m rambling, sorry. I ended up having very low potassium but everything else was fine when they checked my blood work. The following Monday (this was a Saturday), I saw my primary doctor and asked her if there was a way to get my hunger “restarted” basically. She put me on a medicine that was also for depression.

I sort of get where you're coming from. Losing face fat was always a priority because sharper cheekbones = more attractive. From reading your post I don't think I have as difficult a time losing face fat than you do. I'm gonna suggest something radical from my own experience. Something you could try is to start lifting and slowly gain some weight. And then slowly lose that weight. There may be hormonal mumbo jumbo forcing the fat in your face to stick around. If you gain some body fat and muscle (yes your face will get chubbier but I think you're willing to hear all options) and then proceed to lose some of that fat, something hormonally may click and the fat in your face may reduce at a better rate. I did something similar, albeit unintentionally. After I got to my lowest weight I binge ate for several months. But I also lifted hard. So I gained \~20 lbs of fat and muscle. At that point I had gotten sick of eating and proceeded to cut. I got to a weight that was a bit higher than my lowest weight but my face was slimmer. If you have any questions feel free to DM me.",chiefsfan_713_08,1542459830.0,2018-11-17 07:03:50,"Honestly I'd suggest seekimg professional help, someone to talk to openly about this. You seem in a place where that's financially an so go for it.",colourscaptivating,1542480377.0,2018-11-17 12:46:17,"Man, that really sucks. I've felt similar: I'm one of those people who, no matter how much weight I lose, always have a round face.

I'm not going to try to tell you that I'm sure you're good-looking, or could be good-looking if you just did the right exercise/hairstyle/whatever, because I don't know you at all, and it seems more polite to take you at your word on your looks. Like someone else said, professional help would be good.

But my advice is, can you think about what you value? Never mind you being able to work from home, and never mind your looks. What else is important to you? Do you have friends or family that you care about? Hobbies that you enjoy? Are you hoping to find a romantic partner or have kids eventually? Do you want to contribute something to the world, or make art, or help people, or just generally have an impact?

Then ask yourself, how are you supposed to do any of these things if you are starving yourself? It starts out easy, sure. I remember feeling so clear-headed and free, like I was released from the struggles of being human because I didn't need to rely on food like everyone else. It felt so easy to just not eat. But trust me, the day will come when you wake up so hungry you can't move or stop shaking, and you will try to get out of bed for something to eat and just collapse. Are you in good health now? How long do you think your digestive track is going to keep functioning when you put it through this sort of abuse? Just on a shorter timescale, how much life are you missing out on by obsessively exercising and focusing your life around your diet? I don't know what your life is like, but I had days where I'd sit alone in my room, eating my perfectly balanced 300 calorie meal while all my friends went out for pizza. There's more to life than this.

Let's say I take you at your word and believe you're ugly. So fucking what? You have so many more important things in your life than your looks, and by doing this, you are robbing yourself of the energy and health that you need to spend time with the people who love you, or to have more of an impact on the world than nice cheekbones. Even if it were possible for you to transform yourself into a male model looking dude this way, would it be worth everything you are giving up to get there?

It sounds like you're frustrated because you feel like your appearance is out of your control for the most part, and you're fixating on one of the parts of it that you can control. I've been there too. But being skinny is never going to make you happy enough to make up for all of the pain you are putting yourself through to get there.",hellomireaux,1542491115.0,2018-11-17 15:45:15,"Try asking yourself why this matters in the first place. Why is being attractive so important that it dictates your entire life?  For a lot of people (myself included), the answer is a combination of loneliness, social anxiety, and early lessons about physical appearance.   

Those things are hard to fix, so we turn to something that seems more within our control.  The irony is that the obsession, rituals, behaviors, and compulsive exercise drive people further away from the connections they crave.  Restricting and starvation alter hormonal pathways that help normalize thought patterns, leading to even more compulsive behaviors and anxiety.  It’s a vicious, blind cycle. 

I’m definitely reading between the lines here, but I’m assuming between working at home, fasting (most social stuff involves food), and exercising, you may not have much opportunity to spend time with friends.

As others have mentioned, therapy might be a solid first step here.  At the very least, you’ll walk out with a better understanding of yourself.

Doesn’t matter if it’s about weight or appearance or what. You can’t “hate” yourself into a better place. You can’t self-criticize or tear yourself down in place of self-love. Do what you gotta do to learn to accept your flaws (whether real or perceived). You’ll never settle or feel happy because you’re searching for a peace of mind that doesn’t exist. You gotta learn to love yourself. Keep trying to explore your values BEYOND your appearance. Therapy, workbooks, support groups, journaling, self-reflection, processing, and more, can maybe help guide you. Good luck.

I had been trying to maintain my recovery by myself for the longest time. This time though my thoughts were way more terrifying than they’ve ever been, which is what led me to seek out therapy. 

I balled like a baby as I told my therapist everything. I felt like an immature, shallow child for having an ED (not the case but it’s what I’ve built up in my head). I think that’s a huge thing is we build up so much in our heads already that we don’t actually let real life or real people have a chance to have a genuine reaction. 

Tell them when you’re ready, but for me it was like ripping off a bandaid. I felt insanely more comfortable once they knew my issues and if I have trouble expressing my thoughts I try to string them together or at least give my therapist my thoughts in puzzle pieces so they can try to put them together. ",Pooperoni_Pizza,1542116805.0,2018-11-13 07:46:45,"My therapist made me comfortable right from the first meeting. It just felt comfortable to me. I do not have ED but am subbed here from trying to learn a little about someone I knew.  

Anything you are scared of is 100% the kind of thing you discuss with your therapist. It should be a trusting safe space for you to work through whatever you know or do not know needs some course correction in your life.  

You can start with baby steps. Tell them "" I have something to tell you but I am afraid to talk about it."" Then they will take it from there and I bet it will be all for the best that you do this. Therapists are not here to hurt us make us feel shame. If that is the feeling you do get from one then find a new person to work with. 

It takes courage to open up but the moment you take shame out of what is going on in your life right now is a big step in the right direction. I hope to hear back on your success story soon.",zumacraig,1542220217.0,2018-11-14 12:30:17,"Go in and say 'I don't know how to open up!'

It's not your fault, it's not their fault. Sometimes there's just no chemistry. Don't feel bad for shopping around until you find someone you're comfortable around.

If that sounds like nonsense to you, or you do want to stay with the same therapist, the comments here have been helpful already. They will know how to deal with this if you flag it. I can guarantee they will hear you and not dismiss you. One tip I can offer: write it down. Write what you feel when you have an episode, describe how often it occurs, describe how it affects you. That takes some pressure off the confrontation.

26,9yrajw,caketherapy,1542718949.0,2018-11-20 07:02:29,I have a privilege with this too especially during the holidays. What if you told your mom you would have to limit your visits with her if there were baked goods out? Can you do that? Or if for an extended stay get a hotel room away from the house?,lizefb,1542722822.0,2018-11-20 08:07:02,"This is a difficult situation, and I'm sorry you are struggling. 

It sounds like your mom uses baking in a therapeutic way or because she enjoys it. It's probably difficult for her to understand where you're coming from in this. Many people don't understand what it's like to have an eating disorder. If you live with her, it's even more complicated because you both want to feel comfortable in your own home. 

Are you working with a therapist? One thing that is hard to accept is that bulimia isn't really about the food. It can feel that way, but recovery doesn't have to be about restricting and avoiding groups of foods. Working with a team that includes a therapist, a dietitian who understands eating disorders, and open communication with you mom would probably be the best way to handle this. 

Could you point your mom in the direction of reading material that would help her better understand your illness? I think if she could learn about eating disorders, she might be more compassionate. She might also be willing to curtail her baking while you are working on recovery. 

I hope the two of you can figure out a solution. In the meantime, try to get as much support as you can. Keep reaching out to others.

She didn't know how to help and when I would ask her to do things she did them above and beyond to where even normal eating seemed to merit criticism. The holidays are a rough time to pick this battle. Use the exercises your therapist taught you and work on how YOU think about food.

28,9yr9k5,lizefb,1542722167.0,2018-11-20 07:56:07,"Recovery is complex and not only related to weight. Yes, if you are underweight, it's important to gain weight, but there's also the emotional side to heal. Learning to accept yourself at any weight is one aspect of that, but another issue to address is what caused or what triggers your illness, the root issues. 

So often in recovery, the focus is solely on weight and food, but people who are prone to eating disorders often struggle with coping, self regulating, identity, self-expression, and emotions. 

Definitely trust your own process in terms of gaining weight and eating the foods you crave that your body needs, though. Recovery is also about learning what works for you. It's your path, your journey. 

For some support through this phase, you might check out some blog posts or videos by Tabitha Farrer. Her take on allowing yourself to eat enough, especially during the first stages of recovery is refreshing. It might resonate with you.

Eating habits are just part of your lifestlye whether it be an active choice or just something you kindof slipped into without realizing whereas an eating disorder is a mental illness that causes a lot of distress. Is this way of eating something you've tried to change and you can't? Are your yo-yo eating habits a reaction to the days you go without eating? Do you go without eating on purpose? What is your relationship with your body and self-image? Most people I know with eating disorders are self-diagnosed because they were so tortured inside and they KNEW something was wrong. I also know a lot of people who suspected they had an eating disorder but spent a lot of time in denial because they weren't skinny or because they binged but didnt purge or what have you. Again that is totally false there is no certain weight or BMI that you have to be to have an eating disorder and you don't have to have the stereotypical anorexia or bulimia symptoms for it to be a legitimate eating disorder. I know a lot of people who were in denial because their disordered eating didn't follow the exact criteria of anorexia or bulimia but disordered eating is actually a much broader range than people realize. Look up EDNOS if you're curious EDNOS is actually the most common eating disorder. Basically you can starve yourself for days, then binge, then purge, then binge, then not purge, then starve yourself again, then binge a few more times without purging and all the while be a totally normal weight and be functioning just fine in every other area of your life so that nobody has any idea. I would recommend doing some inner reflection if you're not sure and I hope that you don't have one and you can find a way of eating that satisfys you or continue eating how you're eating already if that lifestyle works for you and you have no problems because of it HOWEVER please please don't be in denial if you think you have one just because it doesnt follow all the ""typical"" criteria or because you're a ""normal"" weight. That's what I did and I wasted a lot of time because I didn't think I deserved to seek out help until I was ""skinny"" enough and I didn't think anyone would care unless I ""looked"" like I had an eating disorder. Again the biggest component and thing to remember is the difference between an eating disorder and irregular eating habits is that an eating disorder is compulsive, you can't stop even though you want to and you try to, it's obsessive and it makes you miserable and depressed whereas irregular eating habits are normal and can be changed.

A symptom",haolime,1543407003.0,2018-11-28 06:10:03,"There are other things that could be happening. Around this age me and a lot of my friends were not hungry at the usual times and were hungry at different times, just like teens tend to have changing sleeping schedules. I was staying up later and eating later. Then I wasn't hungry for breakfast and the cycle continued.

Other things to think about are depression and anxiety can take a toll on feelings of hunger. My anxiety used to make my tummy hurt so much I didn't know if I was hungry or not. Then, with anxiety I've also experienced feeling like everyone would judge what I ate or how I chewed or literally anything I did which can make it hard to eat in front of people but not necessarily an eating disorder (although the same feelings can be a warning sign). And many mental health medications (and other medication) can also affect hunger - either drastically reducing or increasing or shifting when the hunger cues come.

Then there's also the possibility of a fad diet that are so popular these days, including fasting during certain times of the day, only eating certain foods, etc. This, in my opinion, is disordered eating but not inherently an eating disorder. These ""diets"" are increasingly targeted at younger and younger people. Once again, these diets can be a warning sign but I also know people who did them for a while in middle or high school and never again. 

I'm saying all of this just to say there's no need to panic (yet). Many of these things you could bring up or might be best to be spoken about with a professional. For example, if it's the internal clock that's off maybe try to have a meal ready for the times when she's hungry. If it's medication, finding a new one or some other way to help regulate appetite. If it's a fad diet, really showing how they don't work and are unhealthy emphasizing intuitive eating. I hope after you read through these responses you'll find a way to talk to her and help both of y'all.

Eating disorders are not so much about food as they are about control. Being a teenager, and a girl, and having anxiety and depression essentially means you have no outlet — your life is regulated by your parents, by school, and by the media/boys/other girls telling you what you should look like. It’s scary and sad and intimidating. Sometimes these things manifest themselves into eating disorders, as food is really the only thing we can control at that age. 

It sounds like she has definitely developed disordered eating. Skipping meals, reduced portion sizes, and eating in secret all point to that, on top of her already struggling with mental illness. 

I was your daughter and this is exactly how my EDs developed, around the same age as her as well. That was over 10 years ago and I’m still struggling with it. It is no joke. The most important thing is to not comment on her weight — saying she looks too skinny gives us this kind of sick satisfaction and saying the opposite would only cause her to restrict more if that is in fact what she’s doing. If she’s not already in therapy, I’d advise you to schedule that immediately with someone that specializes in adolescences who have eating disorders and anxiety/depression. Raise these concerns to them so they can address them in session with her. 

I’m also not sure how the two of y’all’s relationship works so I’m not sure about how confronting her on this would work. If anything, she would learn to hide it better from you because know she knows you know, if that makes sense. But I’m not really sure how to broach this since my ed was caused and supported by my family. I would consult a professional on this. Sooner rather than later.

I don't know if this sounds like it might be the case for you. I was honestly kind of in denial and thought I was eating ok until I actually began to track it. I still slip some days, but I've also been more mindful of what I eat and when I eat. I still struggle not to load my calories in the after 5pm zone, but at least I'm eating enough most days and that helps me not sleepwalk or wake up to eat as much.

33,a3iahw,ropedragohman,1544069526.0,2018-12-05 22:12:06,"I came across your post earlier today and have so much to say in response, as someone who has struggled with anorexia for ten years, has had 1 solid year of recovery and is now in a slight relapse trying not to succumb to it, I can tell you that it is the hardest damn thing to fight and overcome. It’s like your own brain turns on you completely and this other voice takes over and becomes a part of you so intensely that you are convinced that this voice is right. Every horrible thing it tells you becomes your truth and it never shuts off unless you “obey” it. For me personally my wife of two years has been my biggest support and is really the only person who can somewhat get through to me now but when she isn’t able to and has described what you are describing in terms of what her experience is I will tell you that even when I know she is trying to do everything she can think of to help it’s like almost harder in a sense because it f’ing kills me that I am putting her through a sort of torture with my eating disorder all while I’m feeling really trapped by this damn loud, terrible monster in my head that controls my every more or decision. I would say you definitely are not obligated to put up with anything more than is comfortable as it is really f’ing hard for both parties involved and you do have to practice self care and bad as it may feel sometimes. There are two types of therapies that have really helped me work through a lot of my issues that are the root of my own eating disorder one is called somatic healing and the other is called edmr, idk if these are something your SO would be open to down the line, as it’s imperative first that they are able to work through the ED behaviors and actions and mindset first and be far along enough that their brain is actively involved in making decisions because when you are in the midst of an eating disorder your brain and ability to function normally completely goes out the window. I’ve been forced to be hospitalized and in treatment and idk if that’s an option for your SO but a long term treatment program and being forced to be in one for 10 months is what started my first recovery journey. I got really lucky bc I didn’t have insurance and was able to get a grant that covered my stay. Idk if this is something you’d be able to look into. A lot of times with eating disorders when you start any type of treatment whether it’s outpatient or inpatient you get worse before starting to get better unfortunately, it’s a long, draining exhausting process but it is possible. My wife has found that what gets her through my lapses is really practicing self care for herself and not putting all of her energy into trying to save me which is sooo hard to do but sooo important. As with the pro Ana stuff, I’d try to set boundaries even though it will be hard and there will be resistance. If you become truly worried about something happening such as death, you can have your SO 51/50’d (depending on where you live) as a last case scenario. Personally I’ve had that happen to me and psych. hospitals DO NOT know how to handle eating disorders at all but it is a temporary solution if you are fearful death is imminent and you’ve exhausted all other options. If you’re able to go to a support group for yourself for loved ones of eating disorders or see a therapist so that you have someone to talk to about this that will help immensely as you cannot take all of this on by yourself without an outlet. If you become consumed by this disorder as well you will both be in a dark hole. You have to have to have to practice self care. My wife swears that when she learned how to do that that it changed everything for the better because she was able to set emotional boundaries with me. As far as what to say when your SO says they do not want to get better, know that there is a 95% chance that is their eating disorder talking and not them, that there are all of these layers of eating disorder over who they actually are and what they actually want and in reality your SO is probably terrified to admit they want to get better bc it’s like then they’re betraying the eating disorder. It really starts to feel like you are in a relationship with your eating disorder when you have one and the hardest thing to do is to start fighting back against it bc it’s like this abusive relationship that exists in your head. I feel for you both and it is a long process that just really become more manageable with time, but it is not easy at all, I feel like I have so much to say that I may have not even worded everything that great bc I feel overwhelmed with all of the thoughts in my head right now but know you’re not alone and if you ever need help finding resources or to talk I don’t mind helping. In a weird way I feel like I was meant to come across your post. Sorry for the length and I apologize if anything I’ve said is not helpful. ",mini-guimauve,1544073733.0,2018-12-05 23:22:13,"I'm so sorry to hear that you're in this position - watching a loved one suffer with an ED is never easy. If it's available to you, the first thing I'd recommend is talking to their treatment team or joining a support group for friends and family members of people with eating disorders. These are offered at a lot of hospitals and treatment centers, and they can give you advice on how to best support your SO, as well as take care of your own mental health. The insight that I can offer is that of a sufferer myself. In answer to your first question, there's a fine line to walk between communicating your love and support and coming across as critical. On the one hand, it's incredibly important that this person know that you're on their side, and not out to make them fat or sabotage them. At the same time, sitting idly by while they're consumed by their eating disorder isn't a great option either. I understand the urge to want to call them out on hiding food or somehow intervene, but from my experience, this is rarely helpful. To an extent, you're right about them not being in complete control — it's like having a second inner voice that's incredibly self-critical, unforgiving, and immune to rationality. But I'm sure your SO is already experiencing a lot of guilt for their behaviors. They likely dislike how combative and deceptive they've become but don't see any way out.

&amp;#x200B;

The pro-ana content and comments about not wanting to recover are pretty troubling. At the end of the day, this person is going to have to decide for themself that they want to make a change. Back when I was in the thick of my eating disorder, I was also quite involved in pro-ana sites. I probably would have recovered much sooner if I hadn't discovered them, but there's a reason these communities exist; eating disorders are very lonely. These websites provide a platform where there's no shame in your behaviors, many others share similar stories, and above all else, no one is going to try and take away this pattern of behavior that you've built your life around. The thing that got me to gradually spend less and less time on these sites was feeling like I had another community that I could trust. My support group provided that space for me initially.

&amp;#x200B;

The best thing you can do is to let them know you love them and care about their wellbeing above all else. Do your best not to get upset if and when you find them hiding food. Ask them if there's anything you can do to make eating meals easier. Obviously none of this is a guarantee, as it ultimately comes down to whether or not your SO is able to accept your support. Do what you can, by all means, but also recognize that your ability to help this person is limited. If they don't make progress on an OP basis and do need to go IP it is not a failing on your part.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you found something helpful in this answer. fwiw I know a lot of ED sufferers who could really benefit from having people like you to support them. Best of luck to you both &lt;3

But this is the furthest thing from anything that remotely resembles control. Stay strong my friend. ,TheFarquaadSquad,1544109469.0,2018-12-06 09:17:49,"I just wanna start by saying thank you so fucking much. This is a great response, and a lot of how you describe your own experience lines up with my SO's own descriptions of it. It is very much like another voice, for both my SO, and me when it's pretty much in control of them, if that makes sense.
&gt;sort of torture

My SO also suffers the same thought process. They've told me how hard it is knowing how much stress they put on me, their [parent], their friends, and so on. The best I can do is reassure them that we all love them, and will always be here for them, and that we're all trying to help, but I totally where they're coming from. Likewise with you, and I hope you never forget that your wife loves you, and that you are more than just a burden. 

I'll also look into those therapies, they seem really interesting. EMDR in particular seems like it might help.

&gt;get worse before getting better

That makes sense actually. One of the ways I've phrased this with my SO is in terms of addiction. ED behaviors, from my perspective at least, not sure how accurate this is, seem addictive almost. It's like the same unconscious drive to smoke or shoot up is also acting to make them purge, or workout, or hide food, and so on. Maybe it's not quite the same chemically, but it very much seems that way. One of the things that happens with drug addicts that try to recover is that they go through withdrawals, which are often so intense and painful that they'd rather relapse than keep recovering. Maybe this early stage of my SO's recovery is just the withdrawal. After a while, hopefully, my SO's own brain can start kicking in on its own.

&gt;self care

To be honest, I never really considered this. I've been so caught up in trying to help that I never really considered setting up my own boundaries. It might help a little bit, especially considering that I do get drained, and I do get visibly frustrated or overwhelmed briefly, which is not what I want my SO to see. They already have enough to deal with, and they already believe they're hurting me, so the last thing I want to do is show it in ways that may be harmful. I'll look into a therapist of my own to talk to, or a support group. Anything that can help me learn about this. My SO is the greatest friend, partner, and therapist that I have ever had the honor to have in my life, and while I trust them with everything, perhaps being too open with my frustrations before filtering them and running them through a third party might make it a little easier for them to understand that they really aren't a burden. 

&gt;Pro-ED

The best thing I can really do is suggest that my SO restructure or delete certain accounts/blogs/whatever. It's mostly stuff like Pinterest, viewing pictures of workouts, extremely skinny [people of SO's gender], tips for fasting, etc. Luckily, to my knowledge they aren't involved in any forums or directly talking to pro-ED people. I'll admit that part of me does want to just straight up go on their phone while sleeping and curate their [accounts], but that would be a huge breach of trust, and probably wouldn't even help.

I will say this though, just to elaborate on my position and role, and also to throw a little bright side into the mix. Whenever my SO is in control, they talk a lot about how much I help, even as their ED gets worse briefly. They talk about how much I mean to them, and how occasionally during the happiest moments we have together, they forget they even have an ED. According to them, the voice shuts up briefly, and that's significant to me. It puts a smile on my face, and it's these little sparks of hope that let me try and smile in the face of despair. I would imagine your wife feels the same way, and as you're fighting this relapse, just remember that she's always here. 

Thanks again for the response, this was such a nice gift to wake up to this morning, and I'm so glad I got such a relatable, in-depth reply to my post. It's good to hear you've been in recovery, and I know you're not having it easy with all the thoughts, and the risk of relapse. I just wanna say kudos to you and your wife for going through this, and for making it through one year. You two are strong-even stronger together, and I want to be strong like that for my own SO. Never lose hope, and thank you.",TheFarquaadSquad,1544111337.0,2018-12-06 09:48:57,"Thank you so much for the response! 

As ropedragohman said in their reply, self care is important, and I never really considered it. I'm gonna look into joining a support group if it's offered at my SO's treatment center, and I may also look for a support group/therapist on my own to help me stay strong in the face of this.

&gt;on their side

Ah, I see. I've been trying my best to reassure them that I'm there to help, and that I'm not trying to make them fat (they are maintaining a normal weight, thankfully. Most likely due to the fact that we started treatment before it got too bad *physically*). I do understand where you're coming from though, and I wanna do my best to make sure they understand. They've said a lot about how much they feel I help, so I hope I'm in the clear there.

You're right about the critical thing there. I feel like that's one of the things I've failed at. I try to be kind, but I know sometimes it comes off as critical, and I want to work on that. Usually it's something like ""let's get the full salad instead of the half, okay?"" which I feel isn't too harmful, but when it comes to hiding food, my language has become a bit more direct, like a parent trying to get a child to stop hiding the extra cookie he stole. This isn't really how I want to be. I want my SO to feel normal and cared for, so I'll work on that.

&gt;pro-ana

Luckily, the pro-ana/pro-ED content they view is more like tips for fasting, rather than direct involvement, which I feel is a bit better, since they've had less time to develop trust with a community. The comments on not wanting recovery are extremely worrying though. However, it's not really them saying that, it's more like their ED thinking for them. When we're talking about this, and it feels more like my SO rather than their ED talking for them, they're very clear that they do want to get better. I trust that a little further down the line, once we're past this initial difficult stage of recovery, my SO can be fully certain of their own desire to get better. 

&gt;the best thing

Thank you. I haven't thought to ask, but I will. I know eating for them is a slow, tedious process, and if I can help at all with that I *will*. IP treatment was actually recommended for my SO, but they chose OP anyway. If they do end up really needing IP (which I feel, even now, would give them a head start on their recovery that OP can't really do), I am fully supportive, and I plan on doing my best to visit, to communicate, and to help them in any way possible.

I love this person, and I don't want their ED to take them away from me, and all the people who love and care for them. Thank you so much for your response, it was very helpful, and for the kind words &lt;3",TheFarquaadSquad,1544113125.0,2018-12-06 10:18:45,"Control is a big thing. One of the most poignant things that my SO has ever said to me is that fasting/purging/exercising is what makes them feel most in control. Like, they say they can't *really* control their grades, or their life, but they can control how many calories they can eat in a day (which is usually 0, if they were to continue without supervised meals :c)

However, they've also come to realize that a lot of the time, their ED is the one in control. It's just those behaviors that they can't really help. 

It's tough, but we all wanna see the ones we love get the wonderful lives they deserve. Thank you, and you stay strong as well.

If it stayed at just not eating food when it didn’t look good it would be disordered eating. But you started starving yourself because you like the way it feels. About the anorexia vs Ednos thing, talk to a professional. Best of luck ",lmcafesd,1544022213.0,2018-12-05 09:03:33,"Do yourself a favor and at least mention it to your therapist. You said you used to binge, to me that counts as something. And a lot of why we come to have disordered eating habits or EDs in general is because we need to feel a sense of control. You mentioned having a falling out with your best friend and your parents getting divorced, along with it being bad when you were in college. Those are all huge adjustment periods. 
What happens when you don’t find treatment for any ED is you still have residual habits from it even if you’ve given up the original act. Tell your therapist, they’re there to help you. I wish you nothing but the best and hope you get to where you want to be not just physically, but mentally and emotionally. Good luck to you, darlin! ❤️",mini-guimauve,1544045791.0,2018-12-05 15:36:31,"I think bringing up your disordered eating with your therapist is good idea! You seem to be aware of your patterns of using food to regulate emotions, garner attention and care, etc., which does sound like it's getting into ED territory. Whether or not you are officially diagnosed is going to come down to factors like body image disturbance, fear of weight gain, and frequency of binges. [This page](https://www.eatingdisorders.org.au/eating-disorders/what-is-an-eating-disorder/classifying-eating-disorders/dsm-5) lists the DSM-5 definitions for all the currently recognized eating disorders, if you're really curious about how you'd be diagnosed (side note — EDNOS is now called OSFED). 

That being said, I get how validating it is to have someone hand you a label like ""anorexia"" that is perceived by so many as a serious illness, but a person diagnosed with anorexia is not any more deserving of support than someone with binge eating disorder or EDNOS. When I was a tween/teen I had patterns very similar to yours, but I knew that I wouldn't be diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia because I wasn't ""sick enough"" so it went unaddressed. If I had felt that I deserved to be open about my struggles, I probably could have avoided the massive relapse that happened when I left for college and consumed about a year of my life. And from my experience attending support groups, the first thing that so many people say is that they didn't think they had an eating disorder because their symptoms didn't align with a particular diagnosis. Even if your behaviors aren't too disruptive at the moment, I really think you could benefit from talking through the way you view food with your therapist. Sometimes it's hard to recognize how irrational and potentially damaging certain beliefs are until you say them out loud. And props to you for taking charge of your mental health! It takes a lot of strength to address things like anxiety, depression, and eating disorders.

35,a2zjne,SmallTrail,1543923185.0,2018-12-04 05:33:05,"Hey there
Coming at you with loads of compassion and not a great deal of advice I’m afraid. But! It sounds like you have a great guy, and he’ll be freaked out cause it’s a mind set and a brain pattern that is so alien to him I guess... it sounds like even through frustration he wants to ride this with you. Sorry to hear about your friendship too - ED’s are fucked up and take so much - I’m 29 - in the middle of a pretty crappy relapse, but desperate to not be in that world - navigating it with my partner who I love but gets equally frustrated/angry/confused to some of my behaviours. I’d also be totally up for swapping numbers. Give me a private message if you fancy and we can chat. X",MyMorningSun,1543926706.0,2018-12-04 06:31:46,"These things are a huge toll on the people around you. They just are. I frequent this subreddit often for tips and to offer support, not as someone with/recovering from an ED, but as a family member and friend to others who have had EDs. I will be honest- at one point, it got *bad* for me. It even started to affect my eating habits, and made me extremely depressed at its worst. I was managing doctor appointments, making as many accomodations as I could, listening to this person cry all the time and get sick, all while trying to be as supportive and encouraging as I could (even though after a while, I quit believing what I was saying, anyway). Sometimes, watching a loved one suffer becomes too much for some people. Mental illnesses, at least imo, are even worse- you can't just give someone medicine or do anything to *physically* help, so for onlookers, the situation seems hopeless. Especially if it's someone you deeply care about, like an SO or close friend- the closer those relationships are, the more that the other person involved feels a responsibility to help. When that doesn't happen (because try as they might, these things simply aren't any more in their control than they are yours), it's personal. 

I sympathize greatly with how you feel. You don't deserve to be left behind through this. All I ask is that you see things from their perspective- sometimes, people's empathy for others' misfortune becomes infectious, and it can affect their own mental health. Sometimes it's in their best interests to step back for their own sake, or at the very least, take on counseling and stress management techniques to better manage how they are affected. I recognize that it's a tall order, especially given how you're feeling now, but I encourage you to give them the same empathy and forgiveness that you would want them to give you. 

Now, all of that said- What are you doing in terms of recovery, if I may ask? I understand it's a slow going process, but I'm wondering how you've approached recovery. You've got professional help, which is fantastic to hear, and your boyfriend is actively attending therapy with you, which is even better. But what about at home? Even if you've been making progress, it can be frustrating to not *see* that progress to outsiders. Perhaps you can bring this up to your therapist sometime, and have an individual session for your boyfriend to help him cope. Perhaps your friend as well. And individually, maybe it's time to evaluate how you're handling your own progress at home. Maybe keep a journal or take notes on your thoughts, habits, and how you talk about it. This isn't just so you can help your friend or boyfriend. This is so you can recognize your patterns in thinking and behaviors that may be hindering your recovery in ways that you haven't realized. Sometimes our thoughts shape our lives, and taking a step back to ask yourself, ""Is what I'm saying/doing/thinking encouraging, or is it discouraging? Is it helpful to my situation? How can I change it to become more positive?"" etc. can be beneficial. 

I can't speak towards your experience, but I came from a family in which addiction was a noticeable theme. What I saw was that a lot of the patterns of addicts were strikingly similar to those I witnessed from ED sufferers. Anorexia, at least, is something of an addiction anyway, after all. You're going to have good streaks and some bad ones, and you're going to mess up in some of the same ways- it's to be expected, and that's okay, as long as you're making overall progress- but perhaps you could benefit from attending group therapy sessions and support groups for a wider range of problems. Perhaps even AA, or a general mental illness support group. ",PaleElvira,1543928023.0,2018-12-04 06:53:43,I am in a very similar situation.

I'm in a very similar situation with my bf of 7 months.

It's hard when someone really wants to help and is genuinely concerned, but doesn't know how to.

But I think working with your therapist and involving your boyfriend is the right step. I’m so sorry about your best friend. That’s gotta make everything that much harder. Going through an ED alone makes it that much easier to isolate yourself and continue those kinds of destructive behaviors.

Thank you for all of this, and for taking the time to say it all. 

I've been attempting recovery for about 6 years, since the first time I went to treatment, but I've been suffering from this illness since I was about 13, so 18 years now. I don't see an end in sight, at least permanently enough to say I'm ""recovered"". I know this *sounds* like a bad perspective, but my therapist and I have come to an understanding about this belief of mine and work toward, at the least, harm reduction and weight maintenance (regardless of how I feel about ""recovery""). I have a very hard time saying, ""I'm recovering"" or ""I'm in recovery from"", because I don't think it'll happen for me. But anyway, she's slowly helping me understand the term and how it can make sense to me, but it's taking a good while. She's also *almost* got me believing that there's an ""eating disorder"" mind and a ""healthy"" mind. I'm almost there - it's only taken 6 years. :P

As far as at home goes, I live alone with my kitty cat. Sometimes my boyfriend is around for meals, sometimes he's not. With this lil relapse I've gotten myself into I've not kept food at home (I inadvertently practice food scarcity at home), but now I'm making sure that before I get home from work I stop at the store to make sure I'll always have something to eat. It's just a matter of actually eating it. Anyway, my boyfriend mentioned that I looked a little better the other day, so I'm grateful my progress is at least a little noticeable. 

I'm not the best at journaling, but I should get better at it. I'm not great at positive self talk (but I'm great at the negative kind), so that suggestion is hard for me, but if you've seen it yield positive results, it must be something that can work, right? :)

It's funny you bring up the addiction thing; my dad is a ""recovered"" alcoholic and drug user (clean for 31 years), so I'm an ACOA, even though I didn't directly experience the using. The behavioral aspects are all still there. So nice call on that one. :P My anorexia is certainly an addiction, but a passive one. I never actively think about trying not to eat, I just never get hungry and it doesn't occur to me to eat food or drink water. I even need an app on my phone to remind me when to eat. 

And the bad streaks outweigh the good streaks for me historically, which I think is why people get so frustrated with me. My friend that left me has only ever known me through a bad streak (I've known her for three years now), so it's no wonder she's over it. 

I've done group therapies before, they're just not for me. My mom took me to Overeaters Anonymous when I was a like 14 because they said they treated all EDs, but we learned the hard way that the group basically sat there and gave diet tips the whole time. I absorbed a lot of bad habits from that! I am always welcome at my treatment facility's group sessions, though I get easily triggered and instantly start comparing myself to the people around me. It's awful. 

Anyway, I so appreciate your message and the kindness you put into it. I'm grateful you saw my post. :)

And sorry for the novel!

(i) many of us who have atypical anorexia have been normal weight, only slightly below normal weight or overweight...anorexia does not discriminate as its perfectly happy to take hold of the mind of any particular body
(ii) finishing one's day 'in debt' sounds like the talk of a chronic restrictor, which by definition, is what anorexics like to do -- we chronically restrict our caloric intake and our sick little minds, love everything associated with that
(iii) 'however when that happens when I'm sober I feel kinda shitty' sounds very familiar, like the thought process we go through when we binge.  And yes, anorexics do binge, especially after heavily restricting for days, weeks or months
(iv) 'I'm asking here before because therapists are expensive where I live...'...we can't get well when we are focused on how we look to other people, again another symptom of ED.

One of the greatest disservices one can do to oneself is getting hung up on a label.  It doesn't matter what the compulsion is around food, they are all the same -- they start in our mind.  So please do look into avenues to get well.  I used a 12-step program to recover from atypical AN patterned-behavior.

How would that make you feel, hypothetically?

Calories in my opinion are a slippery slope, because long term they don't really achieve anything. You can check calories and record them for a while, to get a good working knowledge of what constitutes a balanced and healthy diet. I did this when I was significantly obese, I had to face what I was eating, and learn what levels I should be eating, but eventually I couldn't handle counting calories anymore. I needed it to ground myself, but then after that it stopped working. Why is it that you feel you have to count calories OP? See if you can answer that question for yourself and see what lies behind it, whether it is just habit that you can gradually unravel from, or whether you feel *compelled* to do it.",norwaliom,1545099388.0,2018-12-17 20:16:28,"I believe you have traits that are commonly found in those who have Anorexia but the fact that you are aware of how concerning and problematic it is- already reaching out for assistance, makes me think you are CURRENTLY fine.

Each group had clearly defined rules about what was allowed, and what was out of bounds.  (Example:  No specific numbers like clothing size, weight or calories).  Rules were explained to each new member, and gentle reminders were given if someone crossed a boundary.  Most group sessions had a specific topic or theme for the day/week.  Each member would get a chance to share, if they wished.  

I found groups to be incredibly supportive, validating and a place to learn and grow (in a positive way).

At some point before I was a volunteer a group of us made a facebook messenger group chat as a way to stay in touch and check in and that. We shared lots of memes and general chats but I think when it came to talking about EDs, few of us actually share our thoughts and feelings. One day one the members (who is bipolar) had really descended in a bad way and was asking about if the amount of pills she took was an overdose. She continued talking in the chat about pretty dark stuff. People started leaving after that. It’s a shame because it was comforting to me but even I felt pretty upset by it all. 

I think you’re right to have concerns, but I imagine in a therapeutic environment, with the therapist leading etc, it could be nice. EDs are so isolating that if you could get a group of people to feel comfortable around one another, the result on everyone could be fantastic. Or maybe it won’t be. I once had group therapy and I had very clear cuts on my arms, and I was listening to people who were worried about what I perceived to be minor things, not even depression necessarily.

You are not thinking clearly; until you actually start eating again, and actually do that regularly, you won't begin to think clearly. Weight restoration is one thing that has to happen, if not now, then when you DO decide to live. If that decision happens too late, then the problem will be irreparable. You don't want that decision to be made for you...and trust me, I have been where you are.

1. Motivation will happen when you start realizing how much better you feel when food is in the picture again. EVEN though you feel ""good"" being empty right now, it's an illusion.
2. Motivation isn't ever going to happen on its own - unless you are exceptional to the norm. So, the idea of choosing to get better is highly unlikely when you are not eating enough.
3. The worst day in recovery will still be better than the BEST day you could have right now. The guilt, the shame, the heavy burden of all of this...you will finally be free to be strong and capable. You won't have to ever tolerate abuse again, because you will know that you are so much more valuable than that. Just take the steps - it will pay off. 

Also, if you can, it helps to be in residential, or a place where you can be free to focus fully on your health. This is a blip of time in your life that will not hurt your plans at all - besides, nothing is more hurtful to your future than having passed away or being in a vegetative state from a stroke or any other possibility that could happen.

I am not surprised at all with the panic with a food plan.  When I was at my sickest I really enjoyed the feeling of being hungry, and it was like an addiction.  I once hit my head on a marble counter top and gave myself a mild concussion when restricting.  But it doesn't have to be this way.  I used a spiritual program of action, a 12-step program to recover a day at a time.  Its good that you have the medical support as that is super important.

It's is so important to have support and a sense of community during recovery. 

Second, it's understandable that you are scared, exhausted, and maybe even conflicted about recovery in general terms. It's not uncommon to want to keep some of the behaviors that help us cope while also wanting to be free. Addiction can be like this, too. 

One thing to keep in mind is that the more you engage in unhealthy behavior around food, the harder it is to see reality accurately, the more things get distorted. Initially, it might take some extra work and feel uncomfortable as you let go of certain behaviors and habits. Your team should be able to support you. I always longed for someone to figuratively hold my hand through the hardest parts of recovery. Try to find that kind of compassion and care through friends, family, your recovery team, or even online. 

Also, try not to think too hard about limits on your own recovery. When anyone is in the throes of the illness, it might seem like no other life is possible, but it takes many, many little steps to change. Keep your mind and your heart open to the possibilities of recovery and keep imagining how you want your life to be, healthy, happy, free, whatever resonates with you. Try not to focus as much on looks for now. Everyone's recovery is going to be different. Yours won't look like everyone else's and visa versa. 

Think of recovery like jumping into a swimming pool. It can be scary, and you might not know where you will land, but once you are in the water, you have many choices about where you want to go. 

Hang in there. You're not alone. Keep exploring what leads to your urges to stay in the illness and what gives you more hope about your future.  It sounds like you have a lot of heavy issues to deal with, so it's important to get support through your healing of past traumas.

You’re an awesome brother honestly. 

My husband and I have lived with my dad and brother about a year now and there is NO WAY they don’t notice how often I’m purging because the house is small and you can hear everything.

I finally told my husband about my ED today and how long I’ve been angry that he didn’t notice (I’ve been actively binging and perming for years now). His response was he thought I just had a “sensitive stomach” (I questioned his intelligence briefly) 

Though my anger is not his fault, for a long time I’ve not even bothered concealing it in some sort of weird desperate cry for help, for someone to say something to me, show concern, show they pay attention to me, notice me, show me they care about me. 

I can tell you even if one of them **did** notice and say something I would have responded with excuses, lies, and be combative. **But it would have helped and made a difference even though it didn’t seem like it** 

Express your concern, make sure she knows you love and care about her. That she is safe with you and you want to help her start her recovery. 

Just remember you cannot help someone who does not want to be helped. She has to want it and do it for herself. 

Not saying something quiet possibly be the worst thing you can do. ",norwaliom,1545213015.0,2018-12-19 03:50:15,"As mentioned in the top comment, the best thing to do about your sister is to confront her immediately about her purging. The longer you keep the conversation in the dark, the more likely for your sister will begin to slowly spiral back deeper into her purging. Yes, she will feel attaked- when confronted she will most likely lie and even if you make her promise to stop purging, the likelihood of her stopping without someone there to stop her is very slim. Try to always keep a watchful eye on your sister, not hawkishly but look for signs. Calloused knuckles and bathroom trips right after eating (to an hour or two) are likely signs of her purging. Finally, please, please, please notify her psychiatrist and her parents. This relapse must have been triggered by something and it is vital for her to pinpoint the source and recover as soon as possible. With the support of her psychiatrist, parents and you I feel she can get through this but only if you take the proper steps in the right direction.

A ""desperate cry for help"", my (25F) brother (20M) confided in me he had an ED in passing but I thought he had an ED not that he has an ED and now that we are together for the holidays, I can hear him purge after meals and have no idea to approach it. ",tawaythrowa1,1546621859.0,2019-01-04 11:10:59,"I ended up sending her a long text a few days after I heard her the first time, offering her the option of how to respond (eg. We can discuss over text or she can choose not to respond at all). I explained that I felt bad for not helping but that I didnt know what to do and that I hoped she could get help from someone with more experience. I also asked if there was anything she would like me to do, again offering her the option of me making it obvious or me being subtle about it. We texted a bit and had a good conversation about what triggers her etc. But no action items for me. However now I know how to spot an upcoming binge so I can be near her and hopefully my presence is enough to make her stop eating her trigger foods. Or, if I miss it or dont stop her and I see her go into the bathroom to shower, I can go in and use the mirror and leave the bathroom door open or something so that she will be less likely to purge.
Depending on your relationship with your brother I recommend this approach. It allows for some distance and you can both talk without the stress nd emotion of it being an in-person conversation. Your ""supervision"" tactics will be based on his behaviour and your relationship. Good luck. This is very hard.

Too many desserts, too much food.  “Normies” might have “one too many cookies” but for me it’s a landline of triggers and shame.  If you can maybe use a (physically) smaller plate, that has always helped me in the last 5 or so years of coping with my ED (now 31 been coping since 12).  That way you’re really only taking “half portions” in the first place so 2 helpings isn’t really a full giant plate of extras, but it may satisfy that God forsaken voice that says “just a little more”.  My thing was binging after everyone left when my parents hosted.  I would go in the fridge and have literally the same amount I had had maybe 4 hours earlier to myself and that’s where it gets really dicey.

But it’s generally either until you reach a healthy BMI or if you are within that currently, until your body has had time to replenish itself, which ofc varies depending on a ton of factors. 

The weight gain you are seeing right now is water weight, fluid retention, and poop (for lack of a better word). Within the next week or two of eating at least semi-normally, you should see this number go down significantly and ultimately you will most likely only have gained a minuscule amount of weight (single digits). However, if it is more, this is okay and it means your body needs this. It doesn’t mean you will gain that same amount of weight every single week! 

In the first week of recovery, I generally gain about 10 ibs as well and I start to freak out. Then after about a week and a half, my digestive system regulates after being constipated for forever and my eating habits reach a decently normal caloric intake and I only have about 1-3 ibs that I’ve put on.

Yes, I lost all my cellulite when i was deathly thin. I also lost all muscle and was just a walking skeleton. Naturally, when you have almost no flesh or fat, there is no way you're going to have cellulite. At least, I didn't. But here's something: my MD told me she saw patient come in that DID have it, and were at a deathly low weight.

Take away these facts, then:

1. Not everyone gets Cellulite, even if they are overweight. (my SIL does not- she is large, but her skin is smooth...)
2. Those who do get it, get it to varying degrees. Some get it at a more borderline-healthy weight, some get it when they are still underweight, and everything else in between and beyond.
3. It's. Genetic. There is NOTHING you can do - it's basically the stretchiness of the collagen fibers that makes skin appear lumpy, but it is NOT fat. It's just the elasticity of the fibers that is going to make that skin appear that way.

Eating disorders are potentially life threatening illnesses. I don't agree with the suggestion that she keep up the unhealthy behaviors because the holidays can be difficult. That's sort of like suggesting an alcoholic keep drinking because that's his method of coping during the holidays. There's no real right or wrong time to discuss the issue if you see or sense her struggling, so it's better to rock the boat and possibly help someone than keep quiet because you're afraid of upsetting her. 

I hope she's in therapy or getting some kind of professional help. Your role as a loved one isn't to avoid conflict; it's to support her. This doesn't mean you're responsible or that you should confront her in any kind of hurtful way; it just means you don't have to walk on eggshells in order to appease her or enable her. 

It sounds like you're doing a great job of supporting her now, so trust yourself. If you feel like you should say something, don't hesitate. There are some great tips on how to approach others on the NEDA website so that those struggling don't feel attacked or hurt by your words. You might want to check that out before approaching her. 

Good luck. She's lucky to have someone in her life who's caring and wants to help. ",rosieco,1545581428.0,2018-12-23 10:10:28,"Holidays are hard for a plethora of reasons. Unless she is blatantly or frequently acting on her ED right now, I wouldn’t add the burden of extra worry to either of your plates. Maybe just keep an eye on her behavior patterns around food, and if you see a problem, let her know you’re here to help in any way. A good rule of thumb is to ask if she wants you to help keep her accountable or if she’d rather your support be silent. Whatever her answer is, stick to it. Make sure she knows that you want to work with her on this, not force ultimatums or add stress to what is already an undoubtedly difficult issue for her. ",VelvetThunderstorm,1545612334.0,2018-12-23 18:45:34,"Thanks for the feedback.

She may not binge out in the open, where you would be in the know should she get into a binge eating session, followed by a purge. Being secretive around eating could occur, where the individual may try to hide the amount of food they take to make it less obvious that they're binge eating, thus harder to tell when they go to purge. 

Holidays are usually jam packed with food, and thus is pretty ideal for binging over a long period of time (think holiday parties). It can be really difficult to spot though, which is where direct and caring conversation comes in. New relationship or not, if she's told you about her ED, there's an element of trust between you. Ask her if the holidays are difficult for her ED if you're concerned, ask if there's anything you can do to be a good ally to her health. Ask her the questions you're asking here, there's no 100 perfect way to do it, just try to voice your concern and support without judging her choices (easier said than done, I know, but we can only do our best!)

56,a8twwx,AReallyBadEdit,1545587853.0,2018-12-23 11:57:33,"Not an expert but I'll share some tips that helped me. YMMV

Personally I like keto (r/keto). But just trying a new diet isn't enough. Yo u have to understand your diet like you understand a hobby. There are in and outs. Some things I had to understand.

Know your ingredients (Learn to cook within your lifestyle): Recipes are great, but if you don't know how to cook. You either end up buying shit you rarely use or give up and eat junk.

For example, the idea behind keto is that you cut carbs to a minimum. So I needed to learn go-to ingredients that I can work with and not need to rely on a cookbook for. Eggs, Meat, Cheese, Leafy Greens. Without a cookbook I need to know how I can make these foods into something I want to eat. This gives me the feeling that I am in control and accountable for what I eat. Some of my favorite foods I would eat without a diet are in these parameters. Omelettes, burgers (lettuce as buns), Chicken (sauteed/baked), salad (with vinegarette) isn't too bad either.  Almond milk unsweetened vanilla is a good alternative also.

Understand your limitations. This is kind of the slippery slope. Temptation is real, but it needs to be handled or else it gets out of hand. So for me Monday - Friday keto is how I eat. On the weekends I dont go out of my way to make up for lost cravings but if there is a particular thing I have been wanting one or two meals with sensible portions is okay. Even on weekends I am aware of my diet but I give myself the option to go outside of it. Its not a reward, its not cheating, its an option for the weekend that I choose sometimes. During the week THERE IS NO OPTION.

Personally I like intermittent fasting 12 on /12 off. After my window is up for the day its water water water.  I also only order water at restaurants. I used to feel social pressure to order soda or that water looks cheap, but it was all in my mind. Just order water, nobody cares.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If he's allowing those kind of behaviours (which are obviously not healthy or normal) then he is more than likely feeding her disorder. Maybe even encouraging it. Not sure what reason he would have for this but maybe that's where you should start. If there's not a lot you can do with that, id say just keep reasurring her that you are there, and that you are worried for her.

Please be patient and gentle with yourself.  Focus on self-care.  Try to eat something nutritious every few hours.  Even if you only take a few bites, it will help keep meals regulated and keep the practice of being around food for short periods of time.

Think about what you would if it was your best friend in your place.  What would you do to support him/her?  

Do you have a therapist or doctor?  This sounds like a good time to make an appointment and reach out for extra support.  You don’t have to go through this alone.",calowyn,1546569348.0,2019-01-03 20:35:48,"This happened to me earlier in the year. Three year relationship, no warning—we were supposed to go on a celebratory date, instead he’s dumping me—it’s horrible.

In the short term: have your kitchen stocked with comfort foods. Carry them around with you when you’re home. I could barely take two bites before it turned to sawdust in my mouth—so I just tried to make the two bites available whenever I was strong enough. Staved off wooziness. Also, Tylenol genuinely helps with breakup horribleness. Not too much, because there’s not much in your stomach to cushion it, but a dose when it gets bad helped me a lot.

In the long term: you need a therapist and you need your friends. Give them money to grocery shop for you—you don’t need to deal with that minefield. Have someone repackage your food so you don’t know the calories. Throw out your scale if you have one.

I really recommend CBT. That helped me through a few relapses, because it could get at the two pronged issue—that I had these body image issues in the first place, but also that there were very big anxiety-produced physical responses that were a barrier to me being willing to get better. I wasn’t sure I could when I had no appetite.

At one point my brother sat me down and said, “We’re all just waiting for your death certificate and we don’t expect to wait very long.” For me, his honesty was a wake up call that I wasn’t fooling anyone, but for some people it might be detrimental to hear that. He also texted me “I love you forever” later that night, which really touched me.

If she’s in grad school, I assume she’s legally an adult so it’s pretty much her call how to proceed. Which is probably going to be hard for the people who love her.

Getting help can be time consuming and recovery, as you noted, is a process that takes quite a bit of effort. However, this illness is also very time consuming and draining. I finally sought help during grad school because the symptoms of my mental health issues were likely going to prevent me from successfully finishing my program.

After eating try engaging in a hobby or other activity with a friend to distract you. Try to postpone the urge to purge as long as possible, one trick I use is ""I'm going to watch this episode on Netflix, and if I still want to purge after that I can."" Usually urges peak in intensity \~30 minutes from the onset, so if you can delay by at least 30 minutes you're over the worst bit.

Many of the therapies used to treat addiction are also used in treating eating disorders. There's an Overeaters Anonymous group based off of AA. A lot of the coping skills you use to keep sober could be used to help with the anxiety around eating. As you keep eating and re-nourish your body, the anxious feelings around food will start to lessen.

Set a small goal for yourself that day. And really pay attention to your self talk. Your thoughts. When you notice your thoughts sticking on negative self talk/ED try to redirect to something else. 
Get outside. No matter what, find something outdoors to enjoy. Figure out the things that bring you joy and set small goals to do them. Get away from all screens. Get away from all social media while you are healing. I think that is the NUMBER one thing to do as a start point. Only worry about the things you can control and let go of the things you can’t. Control your thoughts! Meditate. Even if it’s for one minute. Tell yourself you are healing and going to be ok, and go from there. Let go of the past and realize the present is all there really is and you have every opportunity in the world to heal and change for the better. I’m not a psychologist but this is what has helped me so far in my own journey. I hope it helps a little bit. Pick yourself up and commit yourself to moving forward and finding joy.

69,ae5qln,bladesman393,1547033132.0,2019-01-09 05:25:32,"Hi OP, I am also a binge eater. A lot of what you describe feels quite familiar to me. The key points in your post, as I see them are:

&gt;	I just go to the store beforehand and buy some junk food. I decide to do this kinda spontaneously, I'll be thinking about it, trying to dismiss the thought, then deciding ""fuck it, let's go.""

And,

&gt;	And it makes me feel like I can't see anybody(like, make social plans) until I'm ""back to normal"", otherwise I think I look bloated or something from the binging.

With regard to the first point, do you binge eat to soothe yourself? I do, I feel uneasy and I eat and it feels “better”. The question is why do you feel uneasy (or similar)? Are you able to challenge that feeling somehow? Can you challenge that feeling by spending more time with people and doing fun things? With bingeing, it is 100 times easier to avoid *buying* something, than it is to buy something and avoid *eating* it. It could be helpful to view the buying of junk food as the real problem, because buying junk means you binge and a binge leads to a purge. Are there other ways you could discourage yourself from *buying* the junk food in the first place? Perhaps it feels too expensive, perhaps you can tell yourself over and over that you *know* it will not make you feel better.

With regards to the second point, that is a slippery slope, so it’s really good you are aware of it. You kind of have to charge through that one or else you will gradually feel more isolated, and then possibly *more* dependent on a cycle of bingeing and purging. We are our own worst critic. The things you think about the way you look, I guarantee your friends don’t think them. Now might be the time to lean *more* on your friends for comfort. I have found there is no comfort to being alone, we as humans are always looking for an external source of soothing; cigarettes, alcohol, food, drugs etc. If we begin to isolate ourselves, *the original feelings if unease become stronger*, the longer this cycle goes without intervention, the worse it feels.

It might not mean much, but I get where you are coming from, and I promise you that it gets easier. It might feel like a habit that has developed over a long period, but habits are much quicker to snap than you think. You are not stuck in some deep hole that is hard to climb out of, you can do this!",rjvjere,1547033161.0,2019-01-09 05:26:01,"Hello, I'll start by saying I'm sorry you are in that situation but good news : this is textbook eating disorder. Many have been there and many recovered, so there is hope. The first thing you have to know about any kind of addiction is that you are trying to fill a void. That can have to do with a problem at home, mental health, a lack of self-confidence (...) and the most important thing you can do to help yourself is to discover what it is. Why are you hurting yourself? Why do you think you deserve it? 

Once you find the answers to those questions, worry not, you don't have to go to therapy but you will need introspection. You need to face the elephant in the room, finally, even if it hurts (which it will), and get it out of there. It can be by writing, creating, working out, talking with people, whatever. But it's time you stand up for yourself.

Recovery takes a long time. A very long time. You will fuck up here and there and that's okay. By the way, it's all okay. Stop being ashamed of what you do, what you think, what you eat, it's a part of the process and will help you with what you're trying to accomplish. My main advice when it comes to take control of what you're eating is to look for balance. If what I understood from your message is correct, either you eat too much or not enough.

Well, aim for 800 to 1000 calories a day. It's not a lot, but it's not ridiculous either. Even if one day you're not too hungry and think you could go with 400, don't. Have more. When it comes to fixing the binging problem, you are going to have to identify the types of foods you are craving (cheese, chocolate, sweets, pastries, whatever) and incorporate them in your day, still looking for balance. 

I suggest you go grocery shopping twice a week. You haven't mentioned being afraid of getting caught so I suppose you live alone? If that is the case, during those two trips to the store every week, you are going to get the healthy stuff (fruits, vegetables, rice, anything that needs preparation and you can't just decide to eat raw because you're bored) and ONE thing of every type of craving you have, but in a small quantity. If you like chocolate, you can get one small bar of Mars, for example. That way, when you get home, you can rush and have that without worrying : it won't destroy your efforts and you'll still be satisfied.

That being said, you need to learn a certain number of things : #1, to chew, instead of gulping down, so you can appreciate what you're eating (I'm guessing you don't as you said yourself that your bingings are not satisfactory). #2, to recognize satiety : before you eat, ask yourself if you're really hungry, how long it's been since you've last had something (and that is regardless of the time or any traditional behaviours - you need to learn to listen to your body, and everybody's is different). And #3, to eat and cook real food. A good idea at least at the beginning would be to journal what you eat in a day (ex : 14/12, 2:30 - big plate of pasta).

I personally wanted to go vegan and cut sugar for a long, long time but I first had to learn all of those things, and moderation, and balance, and now I'm finally there, and I don't have cravings, I don't miss any of it. But it's because I'm full now. I have two giant plates of vegetables + rice/lentils/etc, a piece of fruit (we need sugar, but it can be natural) and some nuts every day, and I don't need more, I don't want more. I can have some food left in my plate and realise I don't want it anymore and put it in the fridge for later. And that had not happened in a very long time.

Trust yourself. You'll be fine.",pepperjack_havi,1547034532.0,2019-01-09 05:48:52,"Hey there! I B/Pd daily for over a year and overcame it on my own. It was hard and there are times when I do wish I would have sought out professional help because I’m not sure if I’m fully recovered. Anyways, I attribute a lot of my success to meditation and journaling. 

When I would start to get the anxious feeling of wanting to binge, I would do even just a short meditation to focus on what I was actually feeling.  Of course this didn’t instantly solve the problem, but combined with journaling I was able to reflect on my feelings before and after a b/p. I like having the words down to look at now even. 

I’m still not able to calorie count for dieting. I feel too guilty if I go ever the allowed amount and it makes me get those negative feelings again. It was difficult, but I made sure to just eat foods that I wouldn’t feel guilty about.

The only thing that has worked was cutting cold turkey. Stop engaging with the behavours. Letting myself eat until I stopped being hungry, not starving myself. Making sure I eat enough (so I don't binge), and allowing myself to eat the food I want. 

Some days have been harder than others. The second week was pretty horrible, and there were times I thought I'd relapse. But so far, it's been easier than what I was expecting it to be. Because this time, I'm truly serious and commited about not hating myself, and not hurting myself.

I definitely need more balance. I actually am vegan too and when I binge, it's always like, a lot of peanut butter, vegan ice cream, dark chocolate, always sweets, I just go to the store and buy a bunch of sweets. Maybe because when I'm not bingeing I never allow myself to have any sweets except like a bit of dark chocolate? Idk. I also don't really have much fat in my normal diet like nuts or avocado or something because it has become a ""fear food"", yet that's most of what I binge on (the peanut butter or ice cream).

I didn't mention it but eating at a table without distractions is a good thing to do. That way, you won't go back and reach for more when it's not needed because your attention was focused on your computer or tv. If you can take a look at the british show supersize vs superskinny on youtube you'll see what the supersizes usually eat gigantic portions out of habit, because it was there, because they weren't feeling full. It is said that it takes up until twenty minutes when you're full for your brain to get the information and decide we can stop eating. You can eat a lot in twenty minutes. So make meals actual meals, not a detail of another activity.

If you like dark chocolate, you should be able to have it whenever. I refuse to believe one can have both a healthy diet and forbidden foods. A very important thing you can do is ""decriminalise"" those sweet foods you enjoy, realise they're not inherently bad. You can, one day, decide to only eat a huge bag of candy. It's okay. Your skin might not like it but your weight isn't going to change and you're not going to explode. Just have fresh foods the next day. Also, if you ever have to buy a big amount of something (ex : vegan ice cream, maybe you're luckier than me but I can't get that in a small size), have guests over the same day and make sure they try it. You're supposed to enjoy that kind of stuff with other people, not by yourself. Make it a happy event!

The best thing to do is to find out your triggers/reasons and replace the B/P with a different coping skill. First, make sure you are eating regularly throughout the day. 3 meals and 3 snacks may feel like a lot, but it lessens the urge to binge. Then you need to find a hobby or other way of destressing/relaxing that doesn’t involve food. Try coloring instead while watching Netflix, yoga/meditation, making friendship bracelets, painting your nails, going for a walk, reading a book, window shopping, playing music, dancing, doing a 1000-piece puzzle, anything really. Then, if you binge, concentrate on stopping or just delaying purging (one thing I would do when I get the urge is tell myself I can’t purge until I finished whatever episode on Netflix I was watching).

When we first got together, almost 6 years ago, I was in a nasty place and had been restricting food, so my body looked closer to my 'goal' (which we of course now know never existed, for when you reach it, it's never good enough). Through loving him, I learned how to better love myself, and then the weight started piling on really quickly, which then cued my panic. He had NO IDEA what to do, other than be there for me. It was tough, because he didn't have the tools in his toolbox to fix my problems, and I could tell it was annoying him to not be able to find a solution (he is a fixer).

I had to sit him down and ask him to lower his expectations of these interactions. When I talk about my ED, I'm not asking him to make it all better, because he can't do that. Only I can do that, and it's a lifelong process. Sometimes I just need someone to hear me ramble, give me a hug, and tell me that he loves me through thick and thin (literally!!) This conversation also had to happen multiple times, with gentle reminders that he isn't responsible for my ED, he can't erase it or the feelings that go with it, and that's okay!

I'm very protective of my ED peeps, because I know the depths of this disease as well as the courage and strength it takes to get out.

79,ailm6f,elf1n,1548153857.0,2019-01-22 04:44:17,"Totally normal! I had hella bloating and constipation for a while in my recovery. It's triggering, but hang in there. From my experience, you just have to push through - remember, not only is your body weight restoring but repairing internal damage too. It takes as long as it needs to. It feels endless, but if you just allow yourself to eat as much as you need, it will eventually restore the balance.

My suggestion is to find some big, comfy clothing for the bloating, keep well hydrated (lemon water is great too) and try peppermint tea (I think it helps with gastric motility). Gentle yoga is good for gassiness, too. ",houston_veronica,1548154697.0,2019-01-22 04:58:17,"Agree with Elf1n - great advice!! You definitely must understand that:

1. You are doing the right thing. Whatever your stomach is doing today (bloating, etc) does NOT negate that you are doing exactly what you need to do for your own health! 
2. It will dissipate - I was promised this, and I am also promising you. I'm about 6 months into recovery and I'm only a little ""poochy"" - and that is probably a permanent ""pooch"" because I was severely emaciated and got used to looking hollow in tummy area. Sorry - that isn't normal, and it isn't even plausible for a person who wants to live beyond a year! Your organs have to go somewhere, so that is what I'm remembering daily: it was never okay to have a hollow stomach.
3. But as for your bloating and constipation, yes - that is temporary, and it will go away! For your own relief, you can try mixing citrucel and miralax into 8 ounces of water (use warm for about 25% of the water, so it will dissolve, then top with more water to 1 cup total).  This will help you go more regularly, and it might take a few times, but it will be so much better.
4. This is a great science article on why you should keep eating and expect your body to adapt nicely.  [https://www.edcatalogue.com/the-bodys-response-to-adequate-fuel-in-response-to-anorexia/](https://www.edcatalogue.com/the-bodys-response-to-adequate-fuel-in-response-to-anorexia/)

I had to eat normally (3 meals a day, about 5 hours apart) drink plenty of water and go for daily walks. The walking and water really helped get things moving. I also had to just let myself be bloated and constipated because laxatives only temporarily helped and prolonged the healing process. I had to learn to trust my body and believe it was doing this for a reason. The more I trusted my body the more tuned in I could become with it.

More so, I have to identify the feelings I am having and will try a coping mechanism before I smoke in case i’m using the drugs for numbing. This method may not work for everyone, but it’s pretty much impossible to beat an eating disorder with an alcohol/drug dependence unless you are in residential. If she isn’t willing to give up alcohol, then she has to learn her boundaries around her actions. That is also one of the major lessons you learn in recovery, anyway. ",invisiblemelly,1548796998.0,2019-01-29 15:23:18,"Hi. This is me. It's gonna be a looooong ride. Everything about coming off alcohol is a direct conflict with the inner eating disorder voice. 
When I quit alcohol I craved sugar because booze is sweet, that terrified me so I started to restrict food again (I was anorexic when I was younger but supposed to be recovered). I didn't notice how much I was restricting or that it was a problem at first because people kept telling me I looked much better, because if you quit alcohol you look better. 
My doctor advised me to walk and exercise more to help me recover from too much alcohol and help with the mental side so I started walking 2hrs or more a day. 

Basically, long story short, restricting food as an adult coming off alcohol turned in to dramatic weight loss that I was complimented about. Then my body rebelled against the restriction and it turned in to binge eating disorder. I felt like I had to burn off every calorie I put in to my body so I exercised a LOT. Then people congratulated me again on the exercise and ""recovery"". 

It's a mess! I'm only now balancing out my eating habits but I have been seeing a counselor since this time last year. She's going to need professional help. 

Oh, also medication for depression has a side effect of weight gain so that's a huge trigger too if she is given anything like that to cope with things she has been drowning with alcohol.

It's hard. Eating disorders are difficult and different for every person; they change the way you see yourself, how others see you, what others are saying. You don't believe/care about a damn thing other people have to say, your eating disorder is number one. So yes, supporting someone with an eating disorder is extremely difficult.

What I can give you is this, you will most likely never understand what its like inside her head. And that's okay. You can acknowledge and validate that it's extremely difficult for her. Let her vent to you. Let her rant about everything that's bothering her, but don't go quick to try and solve anything. All you can do is listen and let her know she's heard. Supply her with comfort. Nice gestures, hugs, throw a blanket in the dryer and wrap it around her. 

Odds are it's going to be difficult for a long time, an eating disorder and recovery are a journey. All you can do is stand by her side and make sure she knows she's not alone in the world.

I think this is a circumstantial thing though. She is quite young so I wouldn’t necessarily disagree that she needs someone to make her not act out. I just remember when my parents backed off, it was a lot easier for me to focus on recovering but I was also 19 years old. They caused a lot of anxiety and stress when they tried to control my recovery. But like I said, I am not a professional and can not speak for her situation. And I always thought the eating disorder was the problem and had no idea it was a symptom of trauma or emotional issues (in my case). So while monitoring will keep her physically safe, the eating disorder won’t go away until what caused it is dealt with. If just therapy isn’t really helping, she might need a higher level of care. I needed hospitalization (ip) at first because just therapy wasn’t doing anything. I’ve done inpatient, residential, intensive outpatient, and outpatient. A lot of parents I know were very hesitant to send off their children because of school, appearance, not wanting their kids to hate them, etc. and while it is hard and feelings are valid, sometimes it’s the only thing that helps.

In my state there is at least one treatment center that accepts state health insurance. 

In the meantime, I'd recommend coming clean with your PCP about your behaviors. You need extra support.",MyMorningSun,1549373606.0,2019-02-05 07:33:26,"I've dabbled in medical insurance and can offer some guidance on how to get started. [Here's a specific summary of benefits for CalOptima](https://www.caloptima.org/en/Members/Medi-Cal/YourBenefits/SummaryofBenefits.aspx).

As an inpatient program, it is covered but it needs to be authorized by your PCP and network, according to the above link. I recommend reading through the entire member plan and guidebook for more specific information about limits on coverage, other requirements, or special circumstances. I assume you have an insurance card as well? I would call the number, provide any and all specific plan information, and ask directly. These calls aren't necessarily anonymous, but you obviously don't have to provide a purpose- just ask if X is covered by your plan and if X-facility is in network. I've contacted some hospitals and insurance companies and tehy don't even ask for a Member ID number, just a plan ID. Often, smaller private IP programs are hit or miss, but most larger network facilities accept state insurance. Pretty much all do, anyway, to varying degrees. 

I'm not in California or on state insurance myself, so I cannot give you specific or anecdotal information regarding your plan, beyond what I find online. 

You need to inform your PCP immediately of your problem, because you need their approval in order to receive coverage. They may also be able to provide guidance as to what category an IP program for EDs would fall under- some may treat it as a general inpatient thing, others as a mental health or rehabilitation service. 

So to summarize:

1. Contact your insurance company for specific plan information. Ask for an email, letter, or some other documentation that verifies the answer. This is helpful just in case there are any issues later on (uncommon but it does happen- my entire job was dedicated to handling appeals due to such mistakes). Ask which category an ED treatment IP program falls under in your Summary of Benefits (inpatient, mental health or rehabilitation, etc.), what specifically is covered and what limits/copayments/coinsurance requirements exist, and what pre-authorizations are required.

2. Contact your PCP and set up an appointment as soon as you can.  Be sure to inform them of your ED immediately so they can take your vital information and discuss treatment options. Be sure to emphasize how long this has been happening, what secondary symptoms (i.e. hair loss, heart palpitations, etc.) you may be experiencing, and why you are seeking inpatient treatment now. Honesty and urgency with your PCP is of the utmost importance. 

3. You need to commit to the program financially. Keep an eye on finances and cut out unnecessary expenditures as needed- even if you are covered under your plan, you will need to account for your usual expenditures since you are also unemployed, as well as any potential medications, psychological treatment, extended stays, etc. that is needed beyond what the program offers. If you have family in the area, it may be best to move in or at the very least, contact them so you have some support once you leave the program (since you will still likely be unemployed- job hunting may not be possible or practical while in an IP program). 

4. In addition to #3, if an IP program is approved, contact the coordinators of the facility or program for payment and insurance information. Some offer payment plans that may be useful to you so you don't have to pay all at once (if state insurance doesn't cover it entirely).

it takes practice but yeah i think it is true that major binge triggers are starting out too hungry and depriving yourself of ""bad"" foods (causing you to fixate on them and want them more.)

It is usually more related to eating more because you let go of some of the behaviors that caused the eating disorder in the first place.  
I do prefer lexapro or celexa in that same class for people with eating disorders however as they have less weight changes associated with them in the literature. Also, they stay in your system longer so you people usually tolerate them better.   
Source: I’m an NP and prescribe meds ",churroscuro,1550333390.0,2019-02-16 10:09:50,"This is one large reason why I went on and off medications before stopping altogether. As someone who has taken a wide variety of SSRIs, mood stabilizers, and anti-pscyhotics for years even the medications that say they're weight neutral make you gain weight if you aren't religious about counting calories which made my ED worse. The worst part was that I'd exercise 3-5 hours a day and I still couldn't shift more than 2 lbs. Some of the weight neutral SSRIs you hear about are celexa and lexapro, and while they're, very good, will still make you gain weight. It's inevitable, it's just a matter of how set you are in recovering. And though I stopped I can guarantee you that taking up medication for as long as I did helped me stop worrying about my weight. I really didn't care, but the fact of the matter was that I slowly became horrified as the weight gain continued to happen even on just weight neutral drugs on top of a variety of other things that made me decide to quit.

 Wellbutrin was the only anti-depressant that gave me weight loss but it's an atypical med mostly meant for smoking cessation and it feels like a stim. If you balance it out with another ssri or weight neutral drug (I took lamictal at the time) they balanced each other out (at least for me) and made my eating habits just normal. BUT, it's not for everyone. The problem with ANY ssri is that you'll craving carbs like no tomorrow and you're absolutely ravenous. Don't get me started on mood stabilizers or anti-psychotics (it's one of the major reasons why people in hospitals and therapy groups stop them too).

TLDR; some drugs are better than others. Weight gain is inevitable, it's just a matter of how dead set you are on recovery and if what you feel while on them is worth a bit of side effects.

EDs are primarily reinforced habits and maladaptive coping mechanisms that need to be undone with therapy (DBT is considered the most effective) and medication isn't the end all be all solution to any illness. Meds for ED simply give a nudge in the right direction while patients undergo therapy so they can slowly acclimate to a healther version of themselves. The reason why you don't see a specific medication for them is because the co-occurring disorders and their severity vary greatly from each individual.

Also simply giving out meds with the sole purpose of gaining weight is sort of implying that ED isn't a mental issue. Just because you're gaining weight it doesn't mean your obsessive thinking has changed a meds don't magically realign them.",lothar42,1550423722.0,2019-02-17 11:15:22,"Yes but at least it would stop them from losing weight.

Try to connect with people the way that works for you/them.

It’s surprisingly tough to think of a blanket statement that would increase awareness without sounding like a platitude or becoming a trigger. And there’s a lot of variation among EDs and the motivations behind them.  I would suggest keeping it relatively nonspecific, not naming any particular disorders (so as not to exclude any) and staying away from emphasis on the ""dangers"".

You sound like an amazing supportive boyfriend.   
I would suggest that when she is in the mood or talking about eating healthier and gaining weight suggest to go to a RD \*registered dietitian\* (it is better than a nutritionist as they are actual physicians) so she gets a nice diet and doesn't have to think about next meal, maybe offer her to follow the diet with her, so she is encouraged. Maybe get the info of one and ask if they are available, keeping the info close to pop it when the situation comes up.   
Idk if it is her case but when I was young I had no idea of how a proper diet with the required nutrition looked like, and this is a problem for many people that think that ""they eat fine"" when they don't.

A professional will probably have much better ideas than me. Good luck!",Sal_42,1549890692.0,2019-02-11 07:11:32,"Can I just say, props to you for being such a supportive partner. She is lucky to have someone like you who is so caring and considerate. What she is going through is very hard and complicated, and it is a tough situation for you too.

Please encourage her to keep seeing her therapist, and remind her that her therapist only wants what's best for her. If she acknowledges that her current weight is unhealthy, that's a good sign. If she can logically see that she needs to change her eating habits and gain weight, then it's logical that her therapist also wants to encourage her to eat healthily and be a healthy weight, yes?  Even though she thinks she doesn't have an eating disorder, she has depression and really does need a professional to talk to regularly. 

It might be best to avoid labels while she is in a stage of denial - sometimes acknowledging that you have 'disordered eating patterns' is easier than accepting a diagnosis or label of 'anorexia'. 

Try and focus on small positive changes, one at a time. If she needs meals to be quick and conveniant, you could try getting protein shakes and protein bars for snacks, and look into companies that deliver pre-prepared meal plans or even microwavable meals. Making small goals, writing them down and having accountability is a good idea, but she needs to be on board with it too. Have a conversation with her and ask what small attainable goals she thinks she would be comfortable with, and agree on a way to keep her accountable to own goals - for example, aiming to eat 3 meals a day of a particular nutritional value, and talking to you about whether she was able to meet this goal every day. If she has access to foods and meals that she enjoys and are conveniant, and is still struggling to meet a very attainable and reasonable goal, this may also raise her self-awareness of her problem. An appointment with a dietician may or may not help at this point, but they might have some suggestions that she can agree on. It really depends on her level of commitment to getting better.

I completely understand the avoidance of labels right now. I don’t really like labeling much either, though I do find it empowering to label something once you come to terms with accepting a situation. I’m not a very religious man, but I definitely do believe we gain power over our demons when we know their names.

When she talks about eating disorders, she seems to have demonized them to the point that she feels the need to deny it and that it is beyond her control. I am sensitive to the fact that this is very real to her and is the reality she lives in. I just hope that I can help her see things in a different light that allow her more control.

She has a very good whole-food ingredient mass gainer that she bought a while back, but she refuses to drink the shakes. She will for a while and I will ask her if there’s anything I can do to help her out with her goal of drinking one a day, and she tells me she would like me to hold her accountable. However, she will either end up refusing to drink them or lie about drinking them. She will also set goals to eat three meals a day and stick with it for a few days but then fall off. I try to encourage her and tell her that there are some days of the week where even I only eat twice a day and that our body’s are very resilient when it comes to food and that we can get back on track the next day but it seems to skip away and she loses hope all over again.

We would also meal prep every week, but the following week, she would either be too tired to prep the meals or wouldn’t have enough money to buy all the food for it.

It seems to be pretty common advice to see a RD and I will definitely find a way to bring that up to her. Finding the money for the appointment will be a different issue as we are both struggling college students.

She won't beat something she doesnt think she has. Or won't admit and tell the truth about.

Eating disorders are egosyntonic disorders. Its not like depression where you feel bad and want to get better. She would enjoy parts of her eating disorder or be afraid to eat and gain weight. Trying to beat an eating disorder is basically signing up to feel really bad, so it maintains the disorder. You have to find a reason to fight to get well. Mine was because I didnt want to feel as mentally unwell as I was and feel like killing myself, severe anxiety and severe depression. Aka rock bottom. I wanted to not lose everything. My ability to work and be a nurse etc.

The question is, is she in denial? Lying? Or telling the truth.

Cognitively, what is going on for her? Is she afraid of food, very restrictive in her choices? Is she trying to lose weight? Does she think she is fat? Does she try to exercise control, or demonstrate any obsessive behaviours surrounding food? Is her portioning appropriate?

One thing I considered, is she could be telling the truth- perhaps even partially. If she has digestive issues, or certain medications or even by starvation etc... hunger cues and hormones can become diminished. She can have physical symptoms that make it hard for her to eat or even sick when she does try to. I know everyone ignores and underscored the reality of this for me in my recovery.. saying it was anxiety. I know better now.

For me it was very hard to contend with poor appetite and physical symptoms in my recovery, related to starvation and from my antidepressant.

Also, encourage her to NOT stop seeing her therapist and such.  I had to stop seeing mine over winter break when I was home for college, and in that time I relapsed pretty hard and I not only haven’t been back to see her, but am now back in the mindset of not wanting to recover.

This post really brings some insight. I guess by filling definitions, she falls more under the category of disordered eating rather than having a diagnosable eating disorder. 

The times she does not eat or doesn’t want to eat are when she is going through a stressful time or when she is having a panic attack.

All throughout her childhood she was told she needed to gain weight by her family. They would skip bacon or extra fat or calories in general into her meals and she became a resentful of that. Because of this, she does not have a great relationship with food and is easily triggered when suggestions of eating are directed toward her. (I have often mentioned she should try to eat something and drink some water when she says she feels faint, cloudy, complains or a headache or feels uneasy... this was more coming from a medical standpoint, knowing low blood sugar often causes these symptoms and food tends to resolve them.) It wasn’t always taken in the light I intended and I quickly learned a better approach.

The slightest implication that she SHOULD eat something or NEEDS to eat something immediately triggers this response in her that makes her not want to eat.

So in this light, maybe attacking the disordered eating wouldn’t necessarily be the best case. More like treating a symptom rather than the cause.

I agree with the person who said avoid labels for now. Maybe she has something like ARFID, or maybe just “disordered eating” due to stress triggers. But if she’s in denial, she’s going to get more upset at being “accused” of having a disorder. 

It’s a good thing you seem to know about nutrition and what she may need/is lacking in. You’re doing a great job at offering, but not pushing, her to eat meals you’ve made. This is really really hard, for both parties. Maybe offer to see a therapist *with* her to try to keep her in therapy? But also, who knows, maybe she just needs a *different* therapist- not to quit but just find one better suited for her.

You need to branch out of safe foods and start eating 100% unrestricted.

I'm pretty much recovered from anorexia, but I gained a lot of weight in the last few years due to depression. I'm better now and trying to lose the weight.

The key is to be careful, make sure you're being monitored appropriately, and go slowly. I told my GP and psychiatrist about my plans to lose weight and got their approval before beginning anything. I try to avoid anything reminiscent of my eating disorder. I mainly skipped meals to lose weight, so now I make a point to eat three meals every day. They're smaller meals, because I'm trying to lose weight, but they're still proper meals. Exercise was never really a factor in my ED, so now I've embraced going to the gym and trying to build muscle healthily. It's all about finding safe, sustainable ways to lose weight that I know I can keep from getting out of control.

I don't own a scale. Compulsively weighing myself was a big problem for me in the past, and I know that owning a scale could set that off again. My GP monitors my weight periodically instead.

My main focus isn't a set amount of weight loss. It's about building healthy habits and hopefully a healthier body. I've also taken a liking to cooking and trying new foods. When I was ill, I limited what I ate quite substantially, so now I'm consciously doing the opposite. I've discovered that I actually like eating nice food and when I've cooked it myself, it feels like a victory over the disorder.

I don't have any weight loss targets. I know that if I set any, once I reach them, I'll immediately set a lower target. 

I suppose seeing a dietician with ED experience would potentially be helpful, but it's not something I really feel I need. I'm managing well enough on my own to eat a reasonably healthy diet.

This likely applies to people who want curves 8n certain places or fixate on gaining muscle bulk. ",kitty_kuddles,1550518020.0,2019-02-18 13:27:00,"Well, the opposite of anorexia is ""bigorexia"", or ""muscle dysmorphia"". Body builders can often suffer from it. It is characterized by the unstoppable desire for muscle growth, the inability to truly grasp and be content with their muscle size causing them to use steroids and extreme measures like plastic surgery, crazy diets, and so on to alter their appearance.

I know you mean more along the lines of ""fatness"" but I think ""body dysmorphia"" could be ANY preoccupation and skewed perception of your body appearance. I also think it's far more common for the disorder to be connected to thinness because of how frequently ED is comorbid with BDD, but I wouldn't be surprised if the opposite is floating around out there, just less recognized due to societal understanding.

Also, if you check out the BDD website, they use something called ""insight specifiers"" to diagnose BDD. They have this termed as such:

* *Insight specifier*: This specifier indicates degree of insight regarding BDD beliefs (for example, “I look ugly” or “I look deformed”) – that is, how convinced the individual is that his/her belief about the appearance of the disliked body parts is true. Levels of insight are “with good or fair insight,” “with poor insight,” and “with absent insight/delusional beliefs.” Note that absent insight/delusional beliefs are diagnosed as BDD, not as a psychotic disorder.

So from this I would take away that preoccupation of thinking parts of you look thinner rather than fatter would probably still count in to psychologists as ""BDD""!",MicroMgr,1550521301.0,2019-02-18 14:21:41,"Yes, that is really possible.

"" It could be ARFID if you dislike eating foods due to any of the above.  


It sounds like you definitely have disordered eating, but the diagnosis itself doesn't matter as much as what you do to help yourself. You will likely need therapy in some form to reduce your disgust with food so you can function normally and eat enough to have energy and live. Hopefully they will even get you to the point where you are able to enjoy eating :) Treatment can be hard, but living as you currently are is not a full life. I hope you are able to find them help you need.  


You were able to do the 3 meals, 3 snacks, and bonus drinks in treatment, you will learn how to maintain a similar intake outside of treatment I hope.

I dated someone with an ED for 3.5 years, and one thing I learned is that no matter how good your relationship is, the people who suffer from an ED face a lot of internal panic when asked to confront it. This makes them want to distance themselves from people and activities and build their life around the disorder.   


I hope you stay there for her as a friend.  Just recognize that an ED puts supporters in a tightrope walk where you want to push them to think outside of their ED, and take steps to getting better, but pushing can generate resentment. 

For a long time after my relationship, I wondered if I pushed her too hard. I would do a lot differently if I could. You're going to have to allow them to just vent sometimes, expressing their emotions with no expectation of offering actions or steps to take. However, you're also going to have to encourage them to think outside the disordered thinking and recognize it is unsustainable.

Having a professional voice gives a level of impartiality and distance that I think is necessary for helping the sufferer.

Tengo demasiado miedo de hablar con un psiquiatra sobre mi trastorno alimentario.  Eso se debe en parte a que hay mucha desinformación.  

No puedo hablar por los demás, pero mi trastorno no fue causado por los medios de comunicación.  No me importan las celebrities flacas, lo que les gusta a los hombres, o los anuncios de dietas.  Ni siquiera se trata de ser delgada.  Es sólo que me odio a mí misma.    La palabra clave es **""control""**.   

La pregunta « ¿Crees que hay suficiente información para ayudar a las personas con trastornos alimenticios? » es muy interesante.  Hay mucha información en Internet si sabes cómo usarla, y creo que la mayoría de las personas con trastornos alimentarios ya la conocen.  El problema es que la gran mayoría de la gente sólo conoce la desinformación.  En particular, no me gustan las campañas de concienciación pública porque siempre se centran en problemas con los que no me identifico, y siempre animan a la gente a hablar con los psiquiatras.  Como dije antes, soy demasiado tímida y nerviosa para hablar con un psiquiatra.

I appreciate that you didn't ask ""Have you been DIAGNOSED with an eating disorder?"" I've never been diagnosed, but it's one of those things you know you have, y'know?  I'm too afraid to talk to a psychiatrist about my eating disorder.  That's partly because there's so much misinformation out there.    

I can't speak for anybody else, but my disorder wasn't caused by the media.  I don't care about skinny celebrities, what men like, or diet ads.  It's not even about being thin.  I just hate myself.   The key word is **""control ""**.     

The question ""Do you think there's enough information to help people with eating disorders?"" is very interesting.  There's a lot of good information on the internet if you know how to use it, and I think most people with eating disorders already know it.  The problem is that the vast majority of people only know misinformation.  In particular, I don't like public awareness campaigns because they always focus on problems that I don't identify with, and they always encourage people to talk to psychiatrists.  As I said before, I'm too shy and nervous to talk to a psychiatrist.  I feel much more comfortable with online information, especially when it is shared by other people who also have eating disorders.

* Lunch at 12 at the latest
* Snack at 3:30pm
* Dinner at 7pm
* Snack at 9:30
* Bedtime 11:30 


Eating in this way allows for planning and flexibility.  Let's say you are running around doing errands and won't make it home for lunch at noon. You can have a snack on the go instead, and move lunch to a slightly later time - say 3pm. Then dinner by 7 still works as does evening snack. 


Regular, mechanical eating like this helps account for 'life' stuff happening while maintaining consistency. It also helps re-regulate huger/fullness cues during recovery.

It’s hard when you start questioning if your behaviors are ED *enough*. Only a doctor can diagnose you of course, but it sounds to me like you do have some maladaptive behaviors related to binging and restricting.

However, are you restricting to compensate your binges? If so that might be why they think you're not eating enough.

It may also be helpful to determined which values you want to embody but might not be very good at right now, then create goals that will help you move toward living your values more fully. 

 Then you can compare your thoughts to your values. Any thoughts that aren’t helpful in achieving your valued goals are not worth focusing on. It’s hard to make them go away but if you can notice and call them out for what they are, they might stop bothering you so much. So when they pop into your head, think “okay, more unhelpful thoughts” or “this is a garbage thought” or “ah, yes, junk mail thoughts” and just let them be there for a while noticing that you are not creating these thoughts, you’re just observing them as they happen. 

Dreams don’t make a lot of sense usually, right? And most of the time they don’t bother us because dreams are “supposed to be weird” and “you can’t control your dreams.”  Thoughts are the same. They come up randomly and unintentionally a lot of the time and they are a product of what we see and hear and some of what we actively think. It seems like a lot of work, but realizing that there’s a difference between passive and active thoughts can be helpful.

I sit down, write what I'm thinking, and then I look at it again after ten minutes of doing something self-care related.  Usually, I'm able to recognize that what I wrote down is an ED thought.  

Another thing you can do is write out your goals and values.  This also helps me, as I use it to question ED behaviors - does the behavior or urge match my values?  Values such as telling the truth and the importance of family are some values I used to motivate myself.  

Also, I recommend the book Life Without ED; the author does a good job of describing how she identified eating disorder thoughts.

135,b2gygz,problematicbeing,1552928227.0,2019-03-18 11:57:07,"&gt; That weight restoration will just leave me in a body I can't tolerate and crippling anxiety that is its own kind of hell. 

  
This advice is much easier said than done, but if you end up in a body you can't tolerate, than you need to work on changing your thoughts and perceptions  so you can tolerate and accept it. If you are only okay with your body thin/underweight, you will need to work on CBT to accept your body at a weight that is actually healthy for it. This is a process, especially if you have told yourself for many many years that you are only good enough at a low weight.  


Some ways to begin this process:

1. Stop being mean to yourself. You can choose the things you say/think about your appearance, when you hear yourself thinking ""my body is too large"" you have to stop yourself and literally say/think "" I am not allowed to be mean to my body, I refuse to give this thought another second of my time""  

2. Work in therapy with an ED specialist who can guide you through tolerating uncomfortable feelings/thoughts about you appearance. This person's job is to help you on an individual level.
3. Try to educate yourself on fat-phobia, HAES, and diet-culture. As a society, we do a ton of body policing and put judgements on people in different sized bodies. Educating yourself on these topics can allow you to understand the cultural influences on how you view your own body and what is fueling the intolerance of weight gain. It was helpful for me to realize why I was so afraid of gaining weight, internalized fat-phobia and fear of losing thin privilege. Finding beauty in all body sizes and realizing true health is not what diet culture's imagine of  a thin white woman eating salad and working out every day, was so freeing.",psyched93,1552935205.0,2019-03-18 13:53:25,"That is really great advice - especially in regards to educating myself. I am sure I'm not even close to being aware of how implicit biases have influenced my view of myself and judgments regarding ways I ""should"" or ""shouldn't"" look. Do you have any good recommendations for books or articles on the topics you noted? ",problematicbeing,1552937544.0,2019-03-18 14:32:24,"Tabitha Farrar is posts videos on youtube about ED recovery a ton and she talks about the importance of body diversity and HAES  


The Food Psych Podcast with Christy Harrison is also good about talking about diet culture and fat-phobia and ED recovery is a very educational way.  


As far as books go, Tabitha Farrar wrote ""Rehabilitate, Rewire, Recover"" which I haven't read but I have no doubt it would be a great resource. Also ""The Body Image Workbook"" is an 8 step workbook to having a better relationship with your body/appearance and I'm working through that and would highly recommend.

136,b2gxgi,problematicbeing,1552925623.0,2019-03-18 11:13:43,"The hair lags behind everything else, usually takes at least 3 months of proper nutrition until you stop seeing the hair loss, then it takes even longer to see strength come back.  You'll likely notice improvement in energy levels, lack of feeling faint, generally feeling less achy long before you'll see your hair and nails and skin look vibrant again.  


&amp;#x200B;

The period coming back varies a ton, some people get it back within a week of eating regularly again, others have to gain to well above the ""minimum 18.5"" bmi to get their periods back. You have to put faith in the fact that if you eat plenty and gain plenty, it will come back eventually. It could be very soon or take a long time, but if you are on the path to recovery, it will return. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Depending on the damage to your hair, it might be beneficial to cut it shorter and allow it to grow back out as you are re-nourishing yourself.

You just have to break the binge cycle to avoid the purging part. I know it's way way easier said than done, and it might take a while to break the binge habits. 

What I find really helpful is to simply NOT buy any food. I go to a restaurant and order a small safe meal and do not bring any food home. 

Remember, it's better to binge purge once a week than every day. If you can start by reducing the amount of b/p cycles, you have a higher chance to completely get rid of the habits. 

Usually, we b/p to deal with emotional issues. Work on those in another way. When you think about something that triggers a binge, try to, instead, write down how you feel. Delay the binge part for at least 30 minutes. Try to keep your mind busy, don't numb it with food. Do not reach for the cupboard, go for a walk instead. Do not surround your brain with stuff related to food, try to find hobbies and past time that have nothing to do with food. 

Try to find a list of safe foods that do not trigger a binge. For example, I know that anything sweet will trigger a binge, so I just go for anything not salty, even for dessert.

What, how, where, or at what time I'm eating -- don't wanna hear it, even if it's positive. If you're wanting to pay a compliment, do so about her personality, resilience, sense of humour, or achievements. There's really no reason to speak about her appearance, even if it's just to say she looks healthy. 

It's tough to navigate and she may not even know what she needs in terms of help right now. It took me several months to even begin to figure out what others could do to help.

When I started to gain weight I got all sorts of hurtful comments that weren’t intended to be. Things like « You look healthy! » and « That shirt finally fits you now! » basically point towards weight gain and it’s the last thing an anorexic wants to hear. If you want to compliment her, things like you look nice, I like your outfit and things like that are better. Also, you don’t need to stare at her when she’s eating. She’s been in treatment she doesn’t need to feel like she’s still there. Obviously make sure she’s not throwing out her food but if you’re having a meal with her discuss the weather, school, etc... Always talking about the eating disorder sucks. She’s still a person. Finally, in the future she will eventually start looking like she’s in a better place physically and mentally but it’s important to remember that for a lot of people it takes YEARS to fully recover physically and mentally. So even if it’s been 2 years since she’s last Beene in treatment and she’s at a healthy weight, she might not be as prone to triggers but it takes one bad day for habits to resurface. I remember I had been healthy for around 8 months and my father said « you’re eating again? » when I went to get a snack from the pantry. It sent me in to a full blown relapse that required hospitalization. Just because she looks healthy doesn’t mean she is mentally. If she talks about her weight gain and says you can that’s great just never assume some things are okay without making sure first.",EDReferral,1554414844.0,2019-04-04 16:54:04," I am also very sorry to hear about your sister and I agree with what many of the other members of the forum have posted. Try not to beat yourself up about it because sometimes the sufferer of an eating disorder can become very secretive about his or her illness and behaviors. I know from my own personal experience with an eating disorder, my older sibling went through a lot with me. My older brother would get angry with me when he would find out I was engaging in eating disorder behaviors and he would become even more angry with me when he found out I was keeping it from him. It can be very devastating to watch a loved one go through this and to feel like you don’t know how to help. However, as ashleyk stated above, letting her know that you are there for her and that she is loved and supported in this difficult time can be very helpful for the both of you.

Ive told them how it makes me want to just throw the food into the garbage right then and there and just starve myself, but they just keep doing it, especially my gpa.  
  
As for my mom, I don’t think she really cares. Shes the type that would bitch at me constantly for eating to much, yet also force me to eat if I wasn’t hungry. I feel like shes actually the reason I developed an eating disorder. Like I had hated my body for years, but it was because of her comments that I started starving myself all day and then I would come home stoned and possibly drunk and binge. I think she might have an eating disorder as well and was projecting onto me since shes abusive.  
  
As for friends, I have a best friend, and shes a sweetie and tries to make me feel better, but it doesn’t actually help. I have another friend, and hes super sweet.

My best friends know. That said, I am also an adult who is living with my partner and I don’t have to spend time with my parents or other family members if I don’t want to. 

I told my mother when I was struggling with bulimia in high school and lived with her part time. It was really hard because she had her own mental issue to deal with and didn’t have room in her life to deal healthily with anyone else’s issues but her own. She tried her best, but there were many times her knowing that I was going to throw up made things waaaaay more complicated and hard.

I agree that you should know your audience. Tell people who tell you everything and who are supportive in an unconditional way. It may take time for some people to adjust but if they are someone you know to be emotionally open, I would say it’s worth it. If you’re dubious about how they may react and you live with them, either have them see you with your therapist when you explain it or make the decision to make your recovery private. 

Who you probably should *never* tell :
—Your boss (even if you’re close)
—Your coworkers(even if you’re close)
—Family you don’t know reeeeeally well
—Friends who have issues with body image or eating problems who aren’t already seeking health over their ED—and maybe not even then
— Family members with body image or ED issues
—Toxic family members or friends

Remember that when you make the decision not to tell someone it should be based upon whether or not you think they are open-minded enough/capable to be there as support for you. You’re ED and recovery *are not something to be ashamed of or to hide*; you should be picky, NOT secretive.

But your husband is your partner in this life, the person you should feel like you can talk through your experiences and issues with.

You're going to spend the rest of your life with this man, shouldn't you be able to tell him anything? Please work up to telling him about it and have space for him to process and ask questions. Also, establish boundaries, you want him to know and support you but it should be clear what he is and is not allowed to help with, or he might assume he needs to monitor your eating like a hawk or do other uncomfortable things.

I found that I often did it right after meals when my family wasn't around, or at night (especially coming home late from the bar). When I could feel the urge coming on, I would remove myself from the kitchen and go clean my room, have a shower, stretch, journal, or talk to someone until the urge passed. Maybe set up an activity or seek out company during the time of day you most often find yourself wanting to engage in those behaviours. 
By the way, I'm in recovery from anorexia so perhaps the need to keep eating after a meal was reactive hunger, but out of fear I would just end up spitting it out. I'd do it with any food, so I couldn't really keep trigger foods out of the house.
My last bit of advice would be trying to normalize your eating habits as much as possible. Make sure you're regularly eating enough, and if you want a cookie, ice cream, etc. Sit down with a portion and enjoy it, let yourself taste it, and swallow it. I often found myself eating little bits of things and spitting them out, so I'll try and take whatever food I'm doing it to, grab a normal sized portion of it, and actually eat it.

Focus on what you can do for her on her terms. Maybe even ask point blank if the subject comes up.

If it helps, then the answer is yes.

&gt;These binges have been more and more common whilst I smoke, which is a habitual behavior I know I can break if I really focus on it and just enjoy smoking. 

There probably is not a correlation, smoking cigs doesn't increase appetite. It's not a habit, it's an addiction. Telling yourself otherwise is foolish. Nicotine is about as addictive as morphine. Don't bother with fitness if you're just going to leave the gym and light up. It just undoes everything you did for your body. For purely cosmetic reasons, I don't smoke because it ages you, almost as fast as tanning. And it's expensive.

&gt;However, this past week has been rough due to stress and relationship issues and I've probably binged 4x in the past week, followed by major restriction or fasting to ""balance out"" the calories. It's evident now that I'm turning to food as a type of numbing agent- sort of how weed actually makes me feel too.

I'm sorry :/ Me, too. When I binge, I do it at least once a day, and the more I do it, the more I need to. It's finally catching up to me, I have esophageal pain when I try to swallow, even if it's just water. I told myself I would stop before it caught up to me, I was fooling myself.

Accepting weight gain is hard for anyone with an Eating disorder, since the ED tells you smaller is always better. The goal of ED recovery though is to no longer listen to the ED. So tolerating distress will be important- just simple recognizing the discomfort and fear with weight gain, and letting yourself feel it, and know it wont last forever. Also, opposite action - talking back to your disorder and saying the opposite of what it says. If you tell yourself every single day 3x a day ""I need to gain weight, I accept my body without making changes, I love myself as I am"" even if you don't believe it, it does slowly ingrain itself in your mind. You might never get to the point where you're like ""weight gain, fuck yeah!"" but maybe the affirmation ""I need to gain weight"" and the ED thought ""Gaining weight will be the worst thing ever"" will cancel out and leave you in a place where fluctuations in weight don't cause horrible distress.  


Intuitive Eating is a great resource, the first step is letting go of the diet mentality. The idea we always need to be restricting, trying to be smaller, trying to change ourselves and ignore our body's cravings. Focusing on that part will be helpful, since if you can get go off all those beliefs, eating and making peace with your body will come much easier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My greatest regrets is waiting so long to seek out treatment. Before getting it, not so much, but afterwards, getting to a good place where my ED is not running my whole life and I have it back, I regret not taking the steps to gain freedom from it. This doesn’t mean I don’t struggle—I still struggle everyday. But, not having almost 100% of my energy taken up by the ED has opened space in other areas that I could not do before. 

You deserve to live a life of freedom from ED. *You deserve to live a life of freedom from ED. **You deserve to live a life of freedom from ED**

I 1000000% understand how terrifying treatment can be, especially when it’s a great unknown, and at first, it can feel like things get worse before they get better, but in sticking with it, I have done so many things that I never thought I could do. And I also believe that if I can do it, so can you. 

Only you can know if your parents will be a help if you decide to do the recovery process. Mine weren’t. And I’m in recovery now without really involving them. It probably was a bit more difficult, but it would’ve been more difficult to include my parents (my mom especially, seeing as she planted many seeds and watered them when it comes to my ED), so I decided to keep them out of my process. But, if yours are generally supportive and caring, it might be good to at least start will telling them something to the likes of that you’re struggling with your relationship with food and go from there. 

I wish the best for you, because you deserve it.",manateesareperfect,1555417871.0,2019-04-16 07:31:11,"&gt;He called me a fatass while I was eating some chips, and when he noticed I stopped eating them he stumbled and started ranting about how I'm ""not fat, need to eat more, and underweight"".

I don't think this is a pro-ED post, you are just afraid to get treatment and I understand that.  The bad news is that you do need help.  And I think you can get help without all those repercussions you mentioned.  Part of ED treatment is typically family therapy, so your mom can be told by a professional that she is not a failure, etc.  You could also consider just traditional once-a-week mental health counseling rather than inpatient treatment, it's a much easier start and might help you a lot.

This is a ridiculous comment.  People who don't understand eating disorders have no idea how to handle people who have them.  Calling someone fat, who is clearly the opposite, is sarcasm and is often how people not equipped with the tools to deal with a problem handle things.  From the sound of the post, OP is a teenager.

Also, I hear that you are terrified of treatment, but this is not the solution. Asking for help hiding your disordered behaviors is something you’d find on a pro-ana/pro-mia website, as it would be further encouraging your use of those behaviors.

I'm not saying this out of judgment, but from a place of empathy, because I struggle with this, too. It's like that saying, ""it takes one to know one.""

I know you're trying to spare your loved ones from worrying about you. You're trying to protect them. But as another user said, we're not as good at hiding our pain as we think we are. If your loved ones don't already know about your eating disorder, they've at least caught on that something is wrong. They might be afraid of saying the wrong thing, and don't know how to help you.

If your mom feels like a failure, that's on her. I know parents are more likely to blame themselves when something bad happens to their child. She's going to have to put those feelings aside, though, and focus on your treatment. When a child gets sick, it doesn't automatically mean their parent is a failure, unless the parent neglected the child's medical needs (such as by not vaccinating them). I don't know what role your mother had in the development of your eating disorder, so I can't say how much she is or isn't to blame. Her immediate concern should be your treatment, not how your eating disorder reflects on her parenting. When your child is sick, you're supposed to put everything else aside to get them the care they need. Let your mom do her job.

I don't know how old your sister is. Is she younger than you? I know you're concerned about how your illness will affect her. While it's not easy when a family member gets sick, it will be easier on her if you get treatment. 

You have an eating disorder, whether you get treatment or not. You're still dealing with it, whether your loved ones know about it or not. It's not Schrodinger's eating disorder. You still have an eating disorder, even if you're the only one who knows about it. Hiding your eating disorder doesn't make it less real, but it does make it harder to deal with.

It isolates you from the support you need to recover. And you do need support, in general as a human being, and especially now because of your eating disorder. Let your friends be there for you. Let them be your rock for once. They may want to reciprocate the emotional support you've given them, but haven't yet had the chance. They might sense that you're holding them at a distance.

You may be everyone's rescuer, but that  doesn't make you any less deserving of rescue yourself. Getting treatment means admitting you have a problem and you need help. And that's hard. But so is dealing with an eating disorder by yourself. If you don't get treatment, it will continue to be more of the same, difficult crap. It may even get worse. Getting treatment at least offers you a chance to try something new. I think this quote by Anais Nin applies to your situation: ""And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve also struggled with night eating for comfort, also specific foods. It’s really helped me to incorporate those foods into my regular routine- for me, I love French fries. I used to make a tray of them and veggie nuggets to comfort me at night, but now I have a weekly routine where I get fries after work on Saturdays. Eating them in public helps to (1) break away from the eating alone in bed (2) put less judgement on the food I’m eating and (3) allows me to have freedom from the control of “I must have this in order to feel okay.” I keep low cal but satisfying snacks on hand for if I have munchies at night (for me that’s pickles, steamed freezer veggies covered in teriyaki sauce, and cream cheese English muffins). Yes, I often crave fries, and I still buy them and binge sometimes, but having this “outlet” allows me to feel less controlled by the food. Same thing for potato chips. I used to binge on Pringles, but I’ve found that if I have some with lunch I crave them substantially less at night. One last thing that has helped is keeping a diary. When I feel the need to binge, I write down what I’m feeling- I don’t even necessarily write about food or hunger, but more about needing comfort, love, or support. Sometimes I still binge, but usually recognizing what I’m needing in the moment helps me to find other outlets, such as calling my mom or a friend or posting on a mental health subreddit, or even watching a favorite movie or tv show.

i am so sorry you are struggling with this. I had/have similar behaviors, although maybe not exactly the same. planning meals out all day, using food as “rewarded” or something to look forward to, creating food rituals (specific time you eat, limiting yourself to certain foods, etc) may be a sign of compulsive behavior/ocd/control or anxiety issues. obviously i’m not a professional and you should definitely speak with someone who is, but this is what I’ve been told about these types of behaviors. the overeating at night aspect may be because your body needs food throughout the day. by starving yourself of food for 12+ hours a day you freak your body out! you eat a lot and binge because you are probably hungry. because you are so hungry and have denied yourself food all day, especially food that maybe your body needs but isn’t getting because it isn’t the food you “allow”, it takes a little bit longer for your body cues to catch up and let you know you are full. your body eats more because it is nervous that it will go through another extended period with out food!

So posting this and getting a response was the final straw. My partner already knew about all of this and has encouraged me to get help and so following my GP and a referral I have been given a number to phone (which will have to be tomorrow as it's Sunday) with the NHS. I'm not sure what will happen from here but I feel scared and simultaneously optimistic. 
I spoke to my partners Mom last night (we all live together) and wow it was eye opening. She too had suffered for a while and had a relapse whilst married to my partners Dad and I couldn't believe the similarities such as encouraging your partner to eat things you ""can't"" etc. It helped me so deeply as I could see a mirror image of what mine and my partners life could be and I didn't want that. So I made a baguette and fucking ate it without purging. Yes I still counted the calories, I felt guilty and I felt sick but I did it. 
I'm rambling but I just wanted to update to say I am making some steps.

Being afraid of walking in to hospitals because what if they hospitalize me?

I’ve been hospital free for 2 years and those years in the centers alone are enough to make a person traumatized. This doesn’t include the ED behaviour and so much more.

I have PCOS so my period has always been irregular, but the longest I went without my period was at the height of my ED. My gynaecologist recommended supplements for Vitamin D3, Iron, Calcium, and Magnesium after blood work showed that I was below healthy levels. My doctor particularly blamed my amenorrhea on my Vitamin D levels. I also started a pill called Duphastone, which is a progesterone-only pill. While I don't take any form of birth control anymore and have been in active recovery for my ED for years, that doctor's appointment was definitely a turning point for me.

Would like to add I didn’t get my first period until I was 13, so I was still going through puberty when I suffered through amenorrhea.

Last May was the first time in over three years that i got a period, and I went through a lot of hormonal surges, (my hormones were extremely low which was why my doctor told me I wasn't getting it) night sweats, depression, irritability, extreme hunger, and anger for months before I actually started to bleed. Although I wanted it back badly (I was majorly depressed and my now fiance and I wanted kids eventually, and while I came to terms with the possibility of never having them, he struggled with it) I wasn't ready mentally and I felt like I had failed my eating disorder, I was still holding on to that sick part of me and as a result I relapsed back into my eating disorder and lost it again but told no one. I was very angry at myself; I struggled with suicidal thoughts and purging and just didn't want to deal with anything...so for awhile, once again...I didn't. 
I ended up getting my period back again in October, and I'm on 7 consecutive months of 'normal'. I struggle monthly with both the fear of getting it and feeling like a failure, and the struggle to keep it and look forward to the life I'm about to build with my future husband. 
The only advice I can give you is to not overthink it or stress out over it, once your body decides it's ready it'll come back.

It is possible but it’s a journey and takes work. 

I lost my cycle from the age of 17-24 due to restricting too much for my activity level and losing weight very quickly (145 ish to 105-110 lbs). I was considered a “healthy” BMI of 19 when I lost my period, but my body was constantly under stress from distance running and keeping a large caloric deficit each day. 

My OBGYN gave me a pill to take for 10 days to force a bleed (forget the name) and then RXd birth control to “kickstart” the bleeding process, but this is a fake period and not a real one. I decided to go off the birth control and try to regain my cycle naturally (I did tell my doc this and she was on board as long as I did regular follow ups). 

I’m happy to say that after I dialed back on the exercise and started eating more (aka limited intermittent fasting, increased my carbohydrates, and having at LEAST 1200 calories a day which was a huge step for me) did it return. Yes I gained about 15 lbs but my body needed it! My body was constantly under stress and obviously your body won’t want you to have a baby if it thinks there is a famine going on, so what happens? You lose your period. 

Having your hormones balance out is worth it and immensely better for your body in the long run for a variety of reasons I won’t go into, but stay strong and have your doctor or therapist help you through the process.

I know my story is specifically about fertility, but it was really amazing to me that my body could reset itself after having a baby.

It sounds to me (I’m not a doctor) that your body is lacking iron (which you already knew) or isn’t digesting properly (which is also probable).

When I start losing weight, I become happy and dandy but it’s fleeting bc of the disordered ways of eating, restricting, purging and exercising. I’m seeing a psychologist to help me with this. I know there was also groups for people going to eating disorder recovery that would help from relapses. 

I know it sucks but I feel like this will be a lifelong struggle. So I’m just trying to find better ways of feeling better rather than going back to disordered eating to make myself feel better.",pianohannah,1558629024.0,2019-05-23 11:30:24,"Yes I have been there before, and yes it has gotten easier. It sounds like your eating disorder is serving the purpose of relieving some difficult feelings. It's important to recognize that this solution for your uncomfortable state is only temporary and will never be permanent. Furthermore, you can't really live a fulfilling life AND cycle through periods of restriction and recovery efforts. Realizing this fact has been important in my recovery; my eating disorder, and what it wants me to do, does not line up with my goals and values. 

 Your eating disorder is telling you that you're fat, and your eating disorder is keeping you from doing what you want.  I recommend you look into therapy, as a psychologist can help you challenge your thoughts and make progress in recovery. It's tough, but I can tell you it is worth it. I've gone from thinking about food 90% of my day and body checking every chance I get, to enjoying social eating, going to the beach, exercising intuitively, and developing some very healthy, fulfilling relationships. All these things are impossible if you are stuck in your eating disorder and the cycle it wants to keep you in. You DESERVE better and you CAN do it!",lilmizsunshine092,1558630001.0,2019-05-23 11:46:41,"I can completely relate. I have been in recovery for several years, and definitely experienced that cycle of recovery, relapse, repeat that was seemingly endless. I never thought I would see out of this cycle but it does come to an end. Relapse was a big part of my recovery.  Please don’t throw in the towel and quit. Things come so easy in our instantaneous world, sometimes it’s hard to put in the time, the tears and the will to fight. It may seem horrible and painful, wondering if it ever ends, but without relapsing… I wouldn’t be where I am right now. Every binge, every purge, every restriction made me realize my true potential and strength. That my life is so much more than this, binging, purging and restricting my life away. My life became a reflection of my eating disorder- restricted, limited, controlled yet chaotic, and miserable. My eating disorder had been testing my limits, to see how much I truly wanted to recover. I believe when bad things happen to you, you can use them in order for something big to happen in you. Unfortunately, recovery is a lifelong journey and for this why I think infinity signs are shaped the way they are… created &amp; connected for all eternity by continuous ups and downs... forwards and backwards. You can’t draw an infinity sign without an “up” and a “down” and (step) “forward” and “back”. The steps that transform us must be experienced, not just explained. Instead of explaining someones recovery journey, you must experience it.

 Sometimes things will happen that may seem horrible, painful, or unfair at first, but you find out that without facing these issues, you never would have realized your true potential, strength, will power, or heart. Loving &amp; losing moments of true greatness all occur to test your limits. Even bad experiences are learned from, and in fact they are the most important.

“I will be skipping the weight portion of today’s appointment. It is unhelpful and triggered at this point in my Eating Disorder recovery. I appreciate your understanding.” 

That is even more detail than you need to give, you can always simply say “not today, thank you.” If you experience body talk following this, you can choose to say that it makes you uncomfortable, or you can choose to not respond at all. I understand how frustrating and triggering the healthcare environment can be, do what you can to make it a safer space for yourself.

Unfortunately, this is very common in doctors’ offices, especially for things like primary care. Eating disorders are poorly understood in many medical spaces. The “just eat” mentality and “you look great, don’t feel bad about yourself” comments are pervasive, and even medical professionals don’t understand the harm these statements can have. You are not alone in this experience. It is a problem many folks with EDs face and completely unfair to someone honestly trying to maintain recovery. If this is your primary care doctor, would you be comfortable asking them to make a note in your chart that you have an ED and you don’t want to be told your weight or have this commented on. Also, fun fact, you don’t HAVE to be weighed. You can say, “I’m in recovery from an ED and getting weighed does more harm to my mental health than tell you anything helpful about my physical health.” You’re the patient, you’re allowed to stand up for your needs.

So far, I’ve not had a single person cause any trouble, and no one has even commented on my weight or so much as made a funny facial expression.

Changing the way you feel about food and your body takes a lot of time. Sometimes the best way is to not care so much and loosen the spring coils, so to speak. Start by sharing food with people you love. It’ll start to replace some of the negative thoughts about food with happier experiences. It can be really nerve racking and anxiety inducing but once you ride the initial wave of nerves it’ll start to become second nature. You’ll start to care less about what you look like because you have people around you who love you for who you are, not the weight you’re at. Eventually you’ll learn to love yourself the same way. But it takes time and a lot of courage. And patience.

But one thing: I remember when I was still in semi denial about my ED (and even after that) a friend gifted me a memoir of an Ed survivor and it kind of offended me.

Also that friend kept refercing articles and videos they had seen on the internet and it almost felt like they were trying to teach me about my own illness (as if I hadn‘t googled almost every aspect). 
It‘s nice of you to support your friend but if you do give them a book do it sensitively and say that you know it won‘t solved all their problems etc. Maybe even read it yourself beforehand?

If you want to lose weight and diets trigger your eating disorder then please be careful. Losing weight in a healthy way is long process but it is rewarding I promise you. Instead of thinking “how can I lose weight fast but don’t trigger myself” think how to change your lifestyle so you can implement healthy habits into everyday life so you can make your progress sustainable and not triggering. 
Practise your patience.
Go for a walk or for a bike ride near your place.
Try eating more fruits when you need something sweet.

I am passionate about the fact that full recovery is possible- because I found it.  It took a ton of work and two inpatient stays... and MORE hard work, but it’s so worth it.

What specific questions do you have?

What is stopping YOU from getting help?  What is your worst fear when it comes to recovery?",bettyfelony,1559069727.0,2019-05-28 13:55:27,"I've been recovered for ten years. I went into inpatient at 26 and I'm a few months away from my 37th birthday. I will not say that everything has been perfect since then. I still have the ED voice in my head sometimes but I've been able to ignore it and know it's not healthy.

Everyone's eating disorder is different, as are their reasons for developing one. I was deeply depressed and anxious and it was my coping mechanism. It could have easily been drugs or alcohol but I was two afraid of both of those things to try them.

 Mine didn't develop until I was a young adult, maybe around 21 or 22 but it was bad. I won't give numbers but towards the end it was obvious. I thought I hid it very well but I didn't. Family members would voice their concerns to me but I didn't feel worthy of help until an acquaintance brought it up. 

I visited my PCP a few months before going IP. We tried several different anti-depressants until I found the right one for me. I was fortune that it started working right before being admitted. I do not suggest doing this but I left AMA after one week. I told my father that if he didn't buy me an airplane ticket home, I'd take a taxi to the airport and buy my own. I was supposed to meet with the head person at the facility and I waited for them and they never showed so to the airport I went. They proceeded to call my father and ranted at him for buying me a ticket home because I could've had a heart attack on the flight.

I promised him I'd fully commit to recovery and I did. I did an out patient program and it really helped being around people going through the same thing while not being stuck in some hospital type setting. It was a small group but the people from there I still have contact with are still recovered.

But there were other factors that helped me recover:
I didn't want to die young. My dad took me to the IP facility and during a session with a therapist there during orientation, he cried and cried. He felt like a failure of a father for not being able to prevent this from happening. That helped kick me in the ass.

I had a young nephew at the time and my brother just had a baby girl a few months before, I didn't want to not be in their lives. I wanted them to know me and not just have my siblings memories of me.

I don't personally want children myself but I lost my period for a few years. I didn't want to have health problems down the line because of that.

It was affecting my work and I didn't want to lose a job I had for so many years. 

One of my biggest fears during recovery was worrying about relapsing when something really major in my life happened. I've dealt with a lot of death in the last few years and no relapses. Like I said earlier, the voice shows up sometimes but I can ignore it.

I feel so much better now. There is a huge sense of relief in going to bed at night and waking up in the morning and not dealing with ED behaviors.

I'm not sure if this helped at all, sorry for the long back story but I thought it needed to be said. Let me know if you have any questions.",problematicbeing,1559075705.0,2019-05-28 15:35:05,"Hey &lt;3 I hope your recovery keeps going and things get easier.

I had a relapse as soon as I went to outpatient only, but I quickly realized I had to get better because I didn’t want to be in that revolving door treatment cycle.  I had no desire to lose my job and my apartment and go back to living with my parents and going to treatment.  But those were my only real options. And I just wasn’t willing to give up my freedom and career.   Also being in the real world with adults I realized my eating disorder wasn’t cute.  Something that was really eye opening is I have a coworker who has some really disordered eating and exercise tendencies and to see how my other coworkers openly talk about her and how frustrated they get that she doesn’t take care of herself.  I saw how much it bothers people and no one likes it.  Both out of concern and practical reasons like you just aren’t the best employee you could be (even if it’s just you get colds often because your immune system isn’t running optimally from the Ed).  
So I committed to at least getting well enough I could function.  I won’t say I didn’t have rules around food or truly find freedom right away, but I started small by following my minimum meal plan.  The longer I was actually nourished and realized there was so much I wanted to do in life that wasn’t possible with the eating disorder the more I committed to recovery.  I’m not 100% recovered but I’m working on it and I can really live my life to the fullest without worrying about food.  It’s been a slow and frustrating process but it’s 100% worth it and waiting doesn’t do you any good.  The reality is an eating disorder is incompatible with the real world and adult responsibilities.  And at some point you’re probably going to have to choose. 
I don’t regret going to treatment even though I made the most progress outpatient.  It got me out of a dore situation and taught me I could tolerate all the bloating, weight gain, and unsatisfactory aspects of recovery.  It also got me to start dealing with emotions rather than shove them aside.  I think I was able to recover on the outside because I’d done the work in treatment and knew what to do, I just had to apply it.  I of course still had a therapist and rd guiding me.

I am 37 now and the worst of my ED was when I was 24. I did better after I was about 25, but I was barely holding. I was barely staying out of treatment...i was still super inflexible and had a lot of body image problems. I hate that I waisted so much of my young life consumed by my ED. It ruined my time at my sister's wedding (I regret that still so much to this day....it was AWFUL the way I behaved and the ways people reacted to my behaviors and then my brother in law was killed in Iraq 2 years later....I hate that their special day was affected so much by my ED BS), was a cloud over my wedding (not eating your own wedding cake because you're scared of it SUCKS), caused me to not remember what I learned in grad school (so much relearning on my own), kept me from having friendships, screwed up my marriage, and caused years of infertility. 

I still struggle some days, but it's so much better now. My marriage is better, my two kids are a miracle my body made, and I'm able to do the things I love. I hate that my ED stole my 20s but glad it's not ruining my life anymore. 

Yes an ED can wreck your body, but for me, it kept me from living the life I wanted to live, which was most important. Every time I'm triggered, I remember what I could lose and how going to treatment would affect my life, and that keeps me on track.

I relate to SO MUCH of what you've said. I'm in the midst of a lapse right now that I'm desperately trying to claw my way out of without another admission. It fucking SUCKS. I don't need more skills, I don't need more work on my body image, I don't need more confidence, I don't need to love myself or my body--I just need to figure out how to fucking eat, the rest will come (or not) with time.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past three years, my eating disorder has cost me the trust of my husband, huge amounts of time off from graduate school, $10K+ in treatment costs not covered by my shitty health insurance (because, as a 30 year old, I'm on my own for both insurance and supporting myself--I don't have family to fall back on), and possibly my fertility--menopause was temporarily induced because I was severely anemic due to lack of nutrition but I was still getting very heavy periods, after multiple blood transfusions to literally keep me alive, we did this. It's been a year and a half and I still don't get a regular period. In the past year alone, I have lost 4 close treatment friends due to medical complications related to their eating disorders--not suicide (I don't make this distinction to minimize those that lose their lives due to suicide). While yes, there are major health consequences that can strike those with eating disorders at any age, the older you get, the more finite those consequences become. It fucking sucks.   


We have been dealt a shitty hand but we have got to fight the fight and get what we can out of it.   


I've been working a lot with my team (and talking a lot about it with a close friend in a similar boat) lately to work on shifting the perception of recovery--that recovery looks different for everyone and that it doesn't have to be a bowl of sunshine and body positivity to be worthwhile. And working to accept that my ""full recovery"" might not mean being 100% weight restored and eating intuitively but learning to live with a meal plan that keeps me safe and healthy and mentally ok. I've still got a long way to go but I feel the brain parts slowly shifting. I'm trying to identify the things that are important to me that I know I need to fuel myself to be able to do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I gained it like ALL on my belly. It's been about six months and it has spread out more to my arms, legs and butt thank god. So I don't look like I have a baby bump anymore haha! 

For the first month or so, I was ravenous all the time and ate a ton. I also had pretty bad stomach pains, indigestion, and I was really gassy. And bloated. I also got hot flashes, especially at night when I would wake up sweating. It was honestly kind of nice though because I had been so cold before.

My hair continued falling out for about two months, because it's a delayed response. It took six months for my nails to recover and I was so happy because I love to paint my nails and now I finally can again without them chipping off. 

The best change is having more energy and being able to go out again and have a life instead of just crashing after work. I still don't love the weight gain but I am getting used to it. My friend recently told me that ""my booty is poppin'"" and asked what I do to work out so even the gain ain't all that bad.",emzclaire,1559791934.0,2019-06-05 22:32:14,Awesome thanks! I'm just super scared that no matter if I eat a perfect balanced diet that I am going to gain all this weight because my body will have no idea hat the hell is going on. So has everything started settling back to normal?,luceario,1559802127.0,2019-06-06 01:22:07,"Hey! I was restrictive for all of my teenage years so I will never know if I gained my ‘weight back’ because I don’t know what my weight would have been naturally had I not been dieting. However, when I started eating again, I gained weight pretty quickly at first but then it slowed down and eventually stopped at a healthy BMI despite me not counting calories or purging etc. I am still slim but not thin, and I’m really happy with my weight. 4 years on from restoring my weight and I’ve maintained pretty much the whole time, aside from fluctuations, with just general exercise and no diet restrictions.

The major changes for me at first were:
- I was EXHAUSTED! I had such brain fog and was so tired all of the time for the first few weeks. However, as I rebuilt muscle and was fuelling my body and healing properly, this exhaustion went away and I had so much energy it was amazing!
- The fat all accumulated in one place but did distribute over a few months. Until then, just wear baggy clothes and try to remind yourself that the body is storing fat to protect vital organs in the stomach because it is used to periods of starvation. When the body realises it isn’t starving, the weight will most likely distribute more evenly.
- I had a lot of self care to do. Letting go of control over food meant I opened a can of worms of mental health issues and had to embark on a journey of therapy and self-care to heal. I am now pretty healthy, though! Both physically and mentally in a much better place. 
- I was really hungry at first, I felt like I couldn’t stop and I was worried I was developing binge eating disorder. However, over time this normalised and I started to be able to eat normally and be able to tell when I was full, etc.
- Food stopped controlling my life and I found many interests and hobbies and have a generally richer life. Instead of counting calories, exercising excessively and obsessing about food and cooking etc, I was able to take up new hobbies, start a university course, start reading again and be more interested in other things. I’m a more well rounded person and definitely more fun to talk to/hang out with now I can talk about stuff other than food!

A great resource for me during my recovery was:

letsrecover.tumblr.com
AND 
https://edinstitute.org/blog

Both of them provide advice, reassurance and an overview of potential symptoms of recovery, as well as success stories and encouragement. I read all of the posts on these over and over again when recovering, just to reassure myself that I am normal and what was happening was normal for recovery and to prepare myself for what to expect.",houston_veronica,1559811062.0,2019-06-06 03:51:02,"OP, congrats on being on the road to health. Do not be afraid!! I had to gain a loooot of weight (about half of what I weighed at the time of being admitted inpatient had to be added on...). It was really scary in some ways, but having amazing peers and friends I'd just  made to ""jump"" in the ocean of the unknown was what made it so much easier for me. If I had this huge meal to eat, they had it too, or had something equally scary. 

My tips for you:

1. get rid of the scale ASAP. If it's costly, give it to your parents or grandparents and get it away from yourself. Don't weigh yourself right now. It's not even accurate as a true weight, because of water and other fluids.
2. Get rid of anything you wear that is already very restrictive or tight. Just get rid of it. Even if it was $$, there is nothing more costly than allowing yourself to be retriggered into losing weight because of some garment.
3. Invest in a couple of pretty, flowy dresses OR whatever you prefer that is not tight. Flowy yoga pants, skirts with tees, one-size-fits-all wraps for cold places vs. skinny crop sweaters, etc.
4. Don't look at, purchase, or waste any time on things like instagram or fashion websites or magazines. Same for tv. Surround yourself with positive ideas, images and knowledge that has nothing to do with weight or looks. (Neither of those things are remotely related to our worth as people, and are purely heritable. There is nothing special about being ""thin"" or ""pretty"".)
5. Everytime you compare yourself to someone else - either on tv or in real life - STOP: remind yourself that it's your own way of body shaming. Do not engage in comparing. NO one is made like you are. 
6. Don't look at what others are eating, even if it's hard. Keep your eyes on your own plate, and eat according to what your registered dietician has recommended. (If you don't have one, please consider getting one. They are invaluable for coming up with reasonable meal plans that will NOT make you go to any sort of body extreme).
7. Trust your team. If that is an RD, a therapist, and an MD, that is probably the best start for you to have a strong recovery. Allow them to do what they feel is best for you, and follow their recommendations. When you think that they are ""making you fat"", remind yourself that it's ED talking, not you, and certainly not the voice of reason.
8. You will not be ""fat"" at any time. Your fear is irrational. If you WANT to gain weight and make it a goal to be heavy, that is when you can say that you will be heavy by choice, but eating a healthy, varied diet per your meal plan as determined by a professional will NOT make you ""fat"".

About your recovery reactions, like bloat, constipation, belly ""growing"", etc -- ALL of this will get better with time. I promise. I had those concerns, but even eating a six-thousand calorie per day plan, I never had the kind of reaction I pictured. That is not to say that you will have the same experience, but it is to say that nothing is permanent -- your body is constantly adapting. Allow it to rest and do its thing. Keep wearing your pretty flowy outfits.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you have to focus on external qualities, think about the beauty you can cultivate by loving yourself, loving others, loving the planet, and putting  your efforts and energy into restoring your self worth. Those are the things that will carry you beautifully into old age, which is where you deserve to go! If you were to keep up this lifestyle without help, you would not be here for long. It's truly a form of ""russian roulette"" - you do not want to end up gone, and we would all be sad without you. This world needs you strong and present!

* I am definitely feeling the tired/sluggishness. So I've just been taking myself for a little walk around my property to get some fresh air, and avoid the temptation of the bathroom. 
* In regards to the fat accumulation, I had a brief period where I was doing quite well for about month, but I noticed all the fat gain in my stomach and upper thighs! I couldn't handle it anymore, and gave up. It makes me feel a bit at ease to know if I push through, hopefully it will just be a temporary thing.
* What did you do when you were feeling hungry? I am always hungry! Even right after I eat - so I just keep having small healthy snacks in between my meals. I have noticed if I don't I get the urge to eat a whole bunch of the wrong food then feel really ill and depressed. 

Thanks so much for all your information and experience!!!!",stopitma,1559875690.0,2019-06-06 21:48:10,"Yes it is back to normal. I try to eat a balanced diet but I also eat however much I want of things without giving it much thought. Like yeah I try to get all my food groups but I don’t get out a kitchen scale anymore or count bites. It’s pretty great. I think I am a few pounds above my weight before relapsing, but I have also been lifting and gained a lot of muscle. I think I’m more critical and observant of my body than I was when I was well, but I’ve noticed my body is different day to day, especially before my period starts I get really bloated. I know that probably always happened but I notice it a lot more now. That’s the only thing I still kinda freak out about, but fluctuations are normal and healthy. 

The hardest thing for me was the uneven initial weight gain and the stomach discomfort/bloating near the beginning. But if you just keep giving your body sufficient fuel it will eventually calm the f down and realize you’re not starving anymore and you’ll start to feel a lot better. You may also be super hungry near the beginning and if you feel like you need to eat quite a bit to be satisfied that’s ok. I gave into the urge to eat absolutely everything because I wanted to give full trust to my body instead of my messed up mind, and I think my appetite calmed down after a couple of weeks or so? But I ate an insane amount near the beginning of recovering as my body fought to gain the weight back. 

I work at a daycare and there was a baby once who was in the hospital for ten days and lost weight while she was there. When she came back, she couldn’t stop eating. She was drinking bottles faster and more often than I’d ever seen, but once she gained her weight back, she went right back to eating like she had before she was sick. I think seeing that helped me trust my own body too. Things will be weird for a while but your body is equipped to work it out, and things will get back to normal.",emzclaire,1559880984.0,2019-06-06 23:16:24,"Thank you so much, I have already referred back to this reply a few times, to help me get through this day!",houston_veronica,1560037815.0,2019-06-08 18:50:15,"I'm so glad!!

199,bx8dad,stopitma,1559782461.0,2019-06-05 19:54:21,"It sounds like your family isn't very supportive, and I'm sorry for that. :/ I would try hard to take what they say with a grain of salt, and give more importance to what your dietitian (the professional) is saying. You do deserve to eat. You deserve to live in a strong, healthy body that is energized with nutritious food. 

I think your dietitian's point about the long run is a really good point. I'm no stranger to unhealthy coping mechanisms, but focusing on the long run has helped me make healthier choices. If I'm having a bad day, I ask myself how will I feel tomorrow morning if I have 3+ drinks? How will I feel tomorrow if I watch TV for hours? How will I feel tomorrow if I at least sit on the porch to get some fresh air? I apply these same questions to eating and exercising and it has helped me find balance. Not that it isn't still hard, but I'm getting better at it!

It sounds like a lot of your struggle stems from self confidence issues too, which is my case as well! I try to look at pictures of different bodies and I also try to take note of people I think who are beautiful when I'm out with all different body types. I think of the people I love and respect, and see that their body type has nothing to do with why I love them. It helps a little. And I also try to think about what activities make me feel confident or at least calm my mind, and do those more often when I can.

I think you can do it. Some days will be really hard, and you might relapse but as long as you keep trying to recover things will eventually get a little bit easier, even loving yourself.",buceo21,1559787204.0,2019-06-05 21:13:24,"First of all, I just want to say congratulations for seeking help. All of us who have been in a similar boat are soooooo proud of you. I can’t express this enough because I’m literally so proud that you have the self-awareness to understand what is going on. And to seek help. Body dysmorphia sucks!!! And it doesn’t help when people (your family) reinforce all your insecurities. So my first piece of advice is do this for yourself, not your family. Your problems with your body are your own, you shouldn’t have to worry about the thoughts and opinions of others. Acknowledge the body dysmorphia, but try to see that it’s your insecurities screaming at you, and not the truth talking. The truth is that (depending on your belief system) your body was constructed exactly how it is supposed to be by a higher power OR it was hand crafted over millions of years by evolution. Either way, it came out exactly how it was supposed to be. (This was the hardest thing for me to come to terms with, so it’s ok if you don’t see it right now.) You are so much more than your body dysmorphia and your ED. I don’t know you but I know you have skills and talents and abilities that other people don’t have. Remember that is more important that your shape or size. Your therapist is right, restrictive eating isn’t going to work forever (you could end up having some nutrient deficiencies that mess with your entire life plan, like me). Instead, try to seek a healthy lifestyle and don’t worry about your size. Instead of feeling guilty or like you don’t deserve food (you do!!), remind yourself that you only deserve THE BEST! Don’t remind yourself of the things you don’t deserve, remind yourself of all the things you DO deserve. You deserve nourishing food that will keep you energized and full until your next meal. You deserve to be satisfied after every meal, but you get to control what you consume. Consume the things that will do the most for you, give you the most energy, and be the BEST for you. Your body deserves activity, sports or exercise that make you happy. Find a sport or activity you LOVE to do (hiking, dog walking, swimming, running, yoga, tennis, going to the gym etc). Your mind deserves special time to relax and meditate, away from the criticisms of yourself and your family. You deserve a full night of rest, enough fruits and vegetables to supply all the necessary vitamins and minerals your body needs to be the healthy, and self-care. Find ways to deal with stress that don’t involve food (taking a long bath, going for a walk, listening to music, meditating, cleaning). I know it’s hard and it’ll never be easy, but try to build a healthy relationship with food and exercise. And don’t be upset with yourself if you’re not losing weight. Measure your success by the amount of energy you have and by your strength, not by your weight. And not by how you view yourself in the mirror, YOU are not a fair judge of your own body. And quite frankly you don’t need anyone judging your body, not even a fair judge! Your body is something that belongs to you and only you. Society and even family sometimes make us feel like that’s not true. That we are worthless if we don’t fit some predetermined expectation of our outward appearance. It’s honestly bullshit, I’m sorry but it is. My point is: work for a healthy lifestyle because that’s what YOU deserve. You deserve to be healthy. Find ways to deal with physical, mental, and emotional health before you start to try and lose wait. Prepare yourself for the journey, because you’ve got the strength and the awareness to do it, you just need to find the tools that will work best for you. Keep seeking help! Keep making power moves for YOURSELF. Keep going to therapy and acknowledging the negative influences in your life! You are already doing so much for yourself, just keep working every day to do MORE for yourself. Even if that means asking for help, even if you have to ask for help a few times or a lot of times (hi hello, that was me). Think of a new reason to love yourself every day when you wake up and every night when you go to sleep. Take it one day at a time. Forgive yourself when you make mistakes and forgive yourself for the past. And keep going. It’s not going to be an easy journey, but eventually you’ll reach your goal. Even if you don’t know exactly what your goal is yet.",houston_veronica,1559806968.0,2019-06-06 02:42:48,"This is the most amazing advice I've ever read! Everything here is 100% true and absolutely on the right track for a healthy body and body image. OP, you are NOT your ""flaws"" - if you binge, it is because your body is starving and trying to survive. If you were a baby and could see yourself from an outside point of view...as a baby, crying for food, would you say ""you don't deserve food""?  You would not only feed that baby, but take special care to explain how wrong that thought is.

Weight can vary for many reasons, and is not within our control 100% of the time. Your parents have a very limited understanding of how a body works, and they are not your best source for comfort, understanding or knowledge. Please distance yourself from those aspects of their relationship with you. When they say things about your weight, try your very best to ignore them, because they simply don't know the truth.  As this advice stated very well: you are perfect, just as you are. You are meant to be special in your own way, and have nothing that needs to be fixed.

Five days of dieting isn’t going to lose a bunch of weight just as much of five days of eating extra won’t gain a bunch. If you do want to minimize over eating while still allowing yourself to enjoy the food on vacation I would suggest to either pick one or two of the next few days to allow the day to be full of indulgences (not to a binge level) or to pick what you feel are healthy choices for most meals and allow one treat food/ treat meal per day. Trying to pay attention to your bodies feelings of hunger and fullness could help guide you too and if you’re going to pick foods that look really good and enjoyable than taking your time to really enjoy them and eat them mindfully.

I can’t tell you if you have disordered eating, but I can tell you my most common signs: 

1. I constantly think about weight or food. I browsed fitness ig’s, reddits, any media that was about being fit or how to eat healthy, or IF, I was obsessively reading. This later devolved into me obsessively reading about eating disorders, watching youtube videos of girl’s experiences, etc. 

2. I couldn’t see food without thinking about it’s effects on me. Not even just caloric, but anything that it could do to me, I had to consider before eating. There was no “mindless” snacking for me. 

3. I would do little things like not eat until I had earned it. Maybe I needed to clean my room, or maybe it couldn’t be until a certain time, but again, no mindless, “I’m hungry so I should eat.” 

4. I looked at my body constantly. I always felt aware of it, how people saw me, how my body looked in my clothes, etc. 

It presents differently in everybody. My main question for you if you think you have an ed would be this: If somebody told you that you had to stop dieting, and eat 3 regular portioned meals a day, how would you feel? and you can go from there.",aes628,1559704005.0,2019-06-04 22:06:45,I would be very anxious.

Are you able to skip a day of exercise without feeling guilty? Are you able to eat a big meal without becoming anxious or compensating with exercise? Maybe try setting a goal to maintain your weight for a while (a few weeks or a month) without losing any weight and see if it is easy or hard, or to set a goal to consistently eat three meals a day. If you can’t force yourself to do this, even temporarily, then I would definitely consider getting some preventative help before it spirals out of control.

I developed my eating disorder at around your age and I know how scary the idea of treatment can be. Really proud that you are taking the steps to recover! :)

In my experience, outpatient care consisted of weekly therapy appointments, weekly or biweekly check ups with a doctor for weigh ins and to check BP. Occasional blood tests. I also met up with a nutritionist to set up a meal plan to follow and had weekly appointments with a social worker who did family therapy. It’s not the same for everyone but there are probably going to be a few similarities.

Take note that if you deteriorate during your outpatient care then it is likely you will be referred to an inpatient program. It is important to try your best to recover because you are so worth it!

It’s going to be very scary and it’s going to be uncomfortable to increase your intake. You are probably going to deal with a lot of bloating and sudden weight gain which is really due to your body holding on to anything it can. Remember that it takes time for your body to redistribute the weight evenly and that your feelings of anxiety/shame/fear are temporary. Once you are healthier things will get easier.

It’s important to be honest with your team as dishonesty is useless... If you are losing weight/deteriorating you aren’t fooling anyone. Your ED will try and convince you to sabotage your progress and often you will be tempted to go back to old habits because they are a coping mechanism... don’t.

I regret spending so much time nurturing a disease that was ultimately going to kill me. Be honest to your therapist, discuss your insecurities and try and determine what caused you to initiate in these behaviours.

It will be hard and messy and there will be a lot of discomfort on your part and confusion on his, but quite honestly he probably already knows. My boyfriend of 9 months knows when I purge, and when I told him I was still active in my behaviors (he knew I had struggled in the past) he got sad and concerned b it he told me he already knew. 

I know the idea of trying to recover is the worst and you don't feel ready or you don't want it, but fuck it man what's the worst that could happen? It took my almost a year of constantly going in and out of inpatient and residential to just say ""fuck you this sucks and I'm going to get back to life now"". I always excused myself with the whole I'm not ready, I don't want to, I'm not in a good enough place to stop, but honestly that's all bullshit. You're never ready when you start, and you still aren't halfway through. But what's the worst that could happen? You gain weight, feel happier, and have the ability to love your husband a little more.

Really, the only way to resolve this problem is to talk to him. Just vent, say everything you've wanted to about this and continue doing it everytime you want to purge. It won't be 100% effective and most of the time you'll only talk after the fact, but again, what's the harm? Give it a try, take a leap.

If he is encouraging you to eat, then I’m sure if you took him to therapy with you (like another user already mentioned) he’d be able to offer a lot more support. My ED was/is different, it’s just avoidant/restrictive food intake, but my boyfriend really helped me out of it. He’d sit and eat with me for hours if it took me that long to finish a meal. But your husband could become part of your recovery journey in whatever way he, your therapist, and you feel is best. 
Also a more immediate solution to the septic problem (might be harder to keep from your husband) is to start purging in a small trash can. A girl I grew up with would purge and her therapist recommended she keep it in a trash bag so she can see at the end of the day how much food she kept from herself. She said it was really gross and she hated having to keep it all day, but it encouraged her to continue with treatment. In your case, it could prevent future septic problems and give you more clarity about your situation.

It is very difficult, and I truly feel your struggle. Remember you are not alone. With that being said, I think the best thing to do is try not to dwell on it too much. Standing in front of the mirror for too long can mess with anyone's head, and the more you look - the longer you stand there inspecting - the more attention you are giving certain parts of your body, and eventually you see something completely normal as a problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also think it is helpful to try to think - and say - good things to yourself. What I find really liberating is to stand in front of the mirror or just sit on my bed and think/say ""these are my legs"" or ""this is MY stomach"". Instead of thinking about it as nice, not nice, big, small etc I simply think ""well, this is my stomach. This is me. I don't have to do anything to make it acceptable. The fact that I am this way MAKES it acceptable"". Also, although I know it's super hard, try to replace the thoughts you have about body parts with thoughts about your other qualities. Swap ""my x looks y"" with ""I'm kind"" or ""I'm loving"" or ""I'm funny"". And if that's too much, maybe try to swap ""my x looks y"" with ""my x makes me able to dance"", ""my x gives me the freedom to move around"", ""my x is there for me always"", ""my x keeps me alive"", i.e. focusing on what your wonderful, wonderful body can do for you in terms of living your life and doing what you want to do, instead of how it looks.

I've been counting calories since I was probably 15 but as I log throughout the day and close in on my ""limit"" I'd get more and more and more anxious and if that stress plus whatever I was dealing with (plus the crankiness from trying to stay under 1200) reached a tipping point id just fucking eat. Like there was no tomorrow. Like flour and water with fake sugar hating myself and hating it but still eating eat. I hated myself for doing it and hated the concept of being a bulimic or any ""non-perfect"" ED that wasn't butterfly Ana restriction. This part reflects poorly on me, but in an attempt to ""become"" anorexic instead I tried to start over. I decided to not purge and just record. Instead of using an app, I'd just eat what I ate and write it down by hand, entering it into the app after I had brushed my teeth and gotten into bed. By just recording 2 weeks of what I eat without thinking about it WHILE eating, I got a really good picture of my habits. I was eating around 1500 on bad days with occasional 3k+ binges. I then tried to see what I could skip in those normal days to stay around 1400, and tried to eat to that, again only logging at night, and it felt like SO much more food because it was kinda ""in my head"" all day and I just kept track how far through it I was.... And then of course I lowered it to 1300...  And so on and took it too far as is expected..... but I stopped* binging! 


*And by stopped I mean I didn't feel like binging is a major part of my ED anymore.

It’s a win, your recovery is paying off!

2. Your friends and family will not love you any less because you gained weight. These people care about you for the person you are. If anything, they are probably relieved you are finally taking care of yourself. If it makes a difference in their lives that you wear a small of medium, then you know that they aren’t worth keeping.

3. My clothing size does not define my worth. You are not defined by the number your body displays on a scale. You are you passions, your dreams, your values and your actions. So many beautiful women and men are not the smallest size available and that doesn’t stop people from admiring them. Just because a piece of fabric is a little bit bigger doesn’t mean you are now worthless. At first I found it so difficult to feel bigger but after some time, it was nice quite frankly. I was now able to actually find clothing that fit better in stores, I could share clothing with my friends and overall my body was just more flattering in the clothes I wore. I felt like more of a woman, rather than a child.

4. (If applicable) Having a woman’s body is nothing to be embarrassed of. I used to feel super embarrassed and got some reason did not want any sign of curves on my body. Although I was an adult, I had the body of a prepubescent teen. Your period is a sign of your fertility, it is natural and although it can be a pain it is something to be proud of. It means your body trusts you enough for the possibility of a child. Your hips, your breast and your behind will eventually help you feel empowered and like a real boss woman. You are a woman and you are not afraid to own it!

(If you are a man, I don’t truly know what it is like to be a man but I can only imagine the same. Having a bit more weight and a little bit more muscle can go a long way to help you feel more masculine.

I also want to mention that there is nothing wrong with turning away from gender expectations for men and women, I just found some motivation and comfort in my increasing contentment of my feminine body.)

5. Its okay to let people in and see you. They know you’re going through a struggle, they know you are gaining weight and they are almost certainly aware of how uncomfortable you are. They will see this weight gain one day or another and if you can take the steps towards letting them share this experience with you, you will undoubtedly be able to find support and most likely build a stronger relationship with said people. 

6. Finally, you can do it. Recovery is really hard and I just wanted to add that you are making the best choice you could. You’re strong and a couple of years from now you will be able to think back and think of how far you’ve come. When it comes to weight gain, your body will feel much more natural soon and eventually you might be able to see past the dysmorphia. I sometimes come across old pictures and really think that I did ok fact look unwell and I prefer my overall appearance now. I hope that you can look at your new body with love instead of hate and envy for your old self. You might be gaining weight disproportionately at the moment but it will eventually distribute itself more evenly. Really proud of you my dear stranger and wish you the best. You got this!",Bubblegum-N-Orgasms,1560103363.0,2019-06-09 13:02:43,"Omfg the worst thing is when people tell me “I look healthy”. Stop saying that!!!! In my mind healthy=fat.

216,byitqd,smiff_10,1560111663.0,2019-06-09 15:21:03,"Hello there, 

I have tried to set goals for myself. Like eating 2 servings of veggies a day. 1 serving of a sweet. I don't count numbers or calories or any of that because I get obsessive and unhealthy about it.

My dietitian taught me to really think about why it is I like or dont like a certain food. Is it texture, color, smell, taste, crunch ect? I struggle with binge eating. She urged me to really enjoy and think about why I like the food I'm eating. It has helped me slow down and listen to my hunger cues. If I'm full I stop, and I'm happy about it because I fully enjoyed the meal rather than inhaling it. 

Maybe try doing that? Really enjoy your food. Come up with some meals that are super colorful! Reds greens orange ect! Make the food enjoyable! Get different textures and temperatures in there. We have to learn to to enjoy food and realize its not an enemy. 

I'm not sure if that helps but I hope it will. 
I also keep a daily food log. It logs hunger level, what I eat, when, how I feel when I eat, and how I feel after. It's really helped me understand my battle with food.",cindycindyy,1560271482.0,2019-06-11 11:44:42,"Hello,

I struggled with a past of binging and restriction as well. I am on my way to learning how to eat intuitively and follow my natural hunger/craving rhythms. Here are some resources that helped me a lot:

&amp;#x200B;

Follow The Intuition on Youtube:  [https://www.youtube.com/user/ElisaFruitFly](https://www.youtube.com/user/ElisaFruitFly) 

I watched a lot of her videos, from her Q and A's to her other videos addressing more narrow topics regarding the recovery process. I admit, it took me a while to fully understand what she talking about as it was so foreign to me. The more I watched her videos (and I watched a lot), the more I understood what she was saying. She gave me a lot of starter information about how to begin my recovery process.

Kate Noel on Youtube:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9yovaNFICI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9yovaNFICI) 

This is one specific video from her that address mindful and intuitive eating. Her other videos are also helpful. I watched her Confronting Fear Food videos as I was confronting my fear food of ice cream this week.

Youper:  [https://www.youper.ai/](https://www.youper.ai/) 

This is an app you can download. It is an emotional health assistance AI. I discovered this app about a week ago, and it's already been so helpful in dealing with my anxieties about feeling full or hungry, food, eating, deciding what to eat, how I feel about my eating or certain food, etc. It allows you to have guided conversations to restructure or give more insight about all your feelings regarding everything and anything pertaining to how you feel.

&amp;#x200B;

Best of luck to you. You are not alone. Let's get over this together :)",GriefSoap,1560320934.0,2019-06-12 01:28:54,"If a lapse is happening, it might be better to not try to skip straight to intuitive eating, but rather transition to mechanical eating. Intuitive eating requires that you are in touch with and honouring your hunger, fullness and satiety cues, which go away when ED symptoms start happening. 

So mechanical eating would look more like a schedule, eating breakfast at time X, eating lunch at time Y, eating dinner at time Z, and snacks between each meal so that you’re eating something every 3-4 hours. Also making sure that each meal has at least 4 food groups (protein, a carb, an added fat, and a fruit/veggie), and every snack has at least 1-2 food groups. 

Once you do that for a while reliably, once your body is feeling and sending out hunger, and fullness cues and feels satisfied after meals and snacks, then intuitive eating can come because those internal cues and intuitions about food come back that your eating disorder symptoms were silencing and warping. 

So from the therapy I’ve gotten and from the ED dieticians I’ve worked with, intuitive eating has to be SLOWLY worked towards through mechanical eating. And even after moving into intuitive eating, when things get hard or busy or hectic, you might need to go back to mechanical eating periodically.",ebkind,1560804541.0,2019-06-17 15:49:01,This has matched my experience working with professionals as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would highly recommend working with an intuitive eating Dietitian who is HAES friendly. You've had issues with your relationship with food since you were a child, this isn't going to be solved by going on a diet and losing weight, you really need to get to the route of your relationship with food and heal that first. You should also probably work with an eating disorder therapist that is HAES friendly as well.  


I mention HAES, health at every size, because you deserve to live your best, healthiest life, with no limit on your abilities/mobility, and traditional perspective would be ""lose weight, it will solve your problems"" and while weight loss might be part of the process of healing your relationship with food, it's not step 1 and there are so many aspects to improve that will have nothing to do with the number on the scale. That concept is controversial, but my thought behind it is that, even if you were to lose weight, if you still had an unhealthy relationship to food, it's likely it would be a matter of time before you would gain back that weight. Healing how you feel around food is so so so important, and for some people that leads to weight loss, but for everyone, having a healthier relationship to eating will improve their physical and mental health.",ElfjeTinkerBell,1559942382.0,2019-06-07 16:19:42,"You are valid.

I don't think it's a bad thing to think of yourself as a victim as long as you can find a way to see that as a strength and take some of the false blame/shame off of yourself. It's a loaded word that I think has been co-opted by our patriarchal society to tell people the problem is THEM rather than the structures set in place that shame people struggling with metal illness or any sort of recovery. ""I'm not fixated on that part of my life so you shouldn't be either"" or ""I never had to deal with that and I don't understand it so I'm just going to pretend you're the problem"" are a lot of the messages I've received that have hindered my own recovery/ caused relapse because it was the only coping mechanism I had learned. Recovery is so hard and the thoughts don't always go away. In fact I've had almost all of the same ones. I can feel a lot of shame because I am not able to participate in the F\*\*ked up world of diet culture and normalized restriction.

As long as you are not restricting or engaging in ED behaviors in an attempt to lose weight then it's okay. Your body is going to find the place where it wants to be based on who you are and as long as you're healthy then all is good! 

Inpatient treatment definitely saved my life and I'm so thankful for it. The only complaint I have is that a lot of treatment centers put a huge emphasis on gaining weight and they make it feel like if you lose weight then you're doing something wrong. This simply isn't the case. A lot of places (mostly when dealing with adults) set a recovery weight based on averages. They don't really take into account your body type or your family history. When I was inpatient they wanted me at X-weight because that's what is 'normal' for someone my age and height. However, I had been underweight my entire life and my family is pretty thin. Their goal for me was simply not natural for my body. I fought with my nutritionist so much about this and they were adamant I needed to be X-weight. So when I left treatment and I lost weight I was really upset because I felt like I was doing recovery the wrong way. But this isn't true! As long as you are eating healthy and feel good, then who cares what the weight is! Just live your life and enjoy it! There isn't a body type/weight you NEED to be. 

Your therapist is right. One size doesn't fit all.

And then really listen, before suggesting advice or help. A person with an ED is often ashamed or filled with guilt and some denial, and the last thing they want is for someone to force them to do anything about something they're very vulnerable about.

As much as it’s a touchy topic and it can be uncomfortable to discuss (especially if SO doesn’t want to get better) it’s really important your partner gets help as soon as possible. If there are no consequences, there will be no action on her part.

It’s hard to not to damage a relationship when an ED is involved but It’s better to risk having some fights and help her instead of just « supporting her » without actually taking action. If I were you, I would sit her down and have a long conversation with her.

Why doesn’t she want to recover? Why does she want to hurt herself? What triggered it? What can you do to help her and not enable her?

It’s really important to set boundaries and be firm about them. If she refuses to get treatment, it is not your job to sit there and watch her hurt herself. If she really doesn’t want to listen I would think about informing close family members about the situation. Build a support network. Don’t let the problem sit there because one day or the next there will be complications that can’t be ignored, whether it be her electrolytes, her stomach, her esophagus or many other things. Take the time and look at the treatment options in your area, consider outpatient programs or even start with a therapist.

Remember that she will probably be angry but this is overall the right decision to make. I recovered because I was tired of hurting the ones I loved, a lot of people walked out on me and it’s only later I realized that it was my fault for ignoring the help that was being handed to me.

Brace for pushback. Thats part of ED's in my opinion. The pushback is used as a defense mechanism to protect itself from making her see the seriousness of the situation.

Before my husband, my parents sent me to inpatient. Now that I’m married, when I struggle my husband reminds me that our kids can’t be around that and that in order to protect them they will have to stay somewhere else until I decide to get it under control. The ultimatums work for me. I’m now at a place where I actively fight it instead of constantly giving in. So I think it also depends on where your so is at. I just know that before I went to inpatient (and before any type of help) I was in so deep I couldn’t get out of it on my own. I fought recovery until I was actually in it and decided I wanted a life. But it was ultimately up to me. I guess what I am trying to say is you might have to try different approaches to see what works. Ultimatums are not ideal for every situation, but I would likely be dead right now if it weren’t for them. It will be hard to talk about but if your so is doing this often, then it needs to be brought up again.

Stay brave and strong, keep following what you know is right: the need to get better ASAP. Yes, EDs are deadly, and even if you have some sort of ED-offshoot, it is so very important to get help nao!  ;-)  I went inpatient last year after many years of insidious anorexia.  I never, ever though I could do it, but my family intervened (with much love) and well...I'm still alive, thankfully! I'm NOT perfect in my own recovery, trust me - I too am terrible about waiting too long to eat, and it's super shameful for me. But just remember: you are not alone, and you can do this. If you go inpatient, it's a really direct way of addressing a whole lot at once. Imagine how hard it is to try and coordinate visits with 5 or 6 different specialists at a time. Inpatient allows you that ability to get the help you need, and to also be ""off the grid"".

You deserve time to sort through this, and that means you need to disengage from jobs, school, etc. This is law in the US at least, and if anyone tries to mess with you for taking the time to recover, they can probably answer to your lawyer!  So do not fret - people will love and support you. If not at home, your friends you make in treatment will.

Thanks for sharing, OP. I was also shocked when a professional recommended I seek inpatient care, but like u/houston_veronica said, it'll fly and be over before you know it. I spent about six weeks living at an inpatient facility/home and then stepped down to their M-F day program before transitioning back home. My behaviors and habits were very similar to yours, it sounds like, and my issues were also rooted in trauma and anxiety. I was able to find SO MUCH common ground with the other patients during my time in inpatient treatment. Everyone's ED is different, but in my brief experience, most affected people are dealing with trauma of some sort and knowing that I wasn't alone made ""getting better"" seem like a realistic goal. I really value the time I spent in treatment practicing eating and coping in a healthy way because of the support I had from the professionals there as well as from the other patients. Even if you don't view yourself as being sick enough for treatment, it's probably best to listen to your specialist. I've learned the hard way again and again that I'm not a good judge of my own situation when I'm in ED mode; trusting someone else to help and inform is scary, but it's an important skill to learn if you're serious about getting help.

If you don’t think she’s in immediate danger but you are very worried about the near future, talk to her about outpatient/inpatient FOR SURE. If she refuses, talk to her parents.

I would also say that it is completely okay for you to make it seem like doing the outpatient/inpatient facility is not that big of a deal. As some one who went through something similar, at times it was helpful for someone to be like “hey, just go to appease other people,” or “just think of going to this as a break from your parents.” Because once they are in, then being in the environment will force them to work on themselves.

Even though it’s scary, inpatient treatment can be really helpful - obviously this depends on what country you’re in though.

I was supported, was able to just have time to fully be looked after in a safe environment, and came out of it much better. 

Another option is asking her if she would like you to come along to one of her therapy sessions; or another could just be to say to her „dude, I love you so much but recently I’ve been noticing things have been getting worse.

Other answers are great. I want to point out that the reason she is against outpatient/inpatient is that she feels pressured.

Make it as a check out, to see how it is etc. And then talk with her on how she feels about it.

Her university might have some immediate assistance you can check out too. I would say she needs to be out of her home. Are there students facilities she can stay at, even temporarily?

I come from a history of binge eating and restriction, and still struggle with it sometimes but for the most part I am in recovery. When I first began recovery, I didn’t eat intuitively. I ate three meals a day, each meal eating until I was so full I couldn’t eat anymore (what you need to eat depends on yourself). Intuitive eating was hard for me achieve when I was so out of thne with my body and hunger signals. I needed a concrete eating schedule so my body can get used to feelings of hunger and fullness again. Eventually, my body began to tell me what it wanted. I learned to respect my body when it needed food, and most importantly when it didn’t need to eat anymore. I realized that eating to satisfy my mental hunger (whenever I thought about food) was crucial as well. Satisfying my mental hunger was something I battled with later on in recovery. It was hard for me in the beginning because I would eat emotionally or to harm myself. I still count calories sometimes, but find that I don’t count as much anymore. I used to know the exact calories of all the foods I eat or would estimate. But lately I’ve been forgetting how many calories are in certain foods, and I’ve been letting it slide. As long as I’m not hungry, I know I ate a decent amount.",RayRay_Hessel,1561470508.0,2019-06-25 08:48:28,"To me it is: Eat when hungry. Stop when full. Don't worry about set times. Listen to ur body. If ur body is sending distorted signals regarding hunger that makes intuitive eating harder obviously. I had to stop my meds because they made me constantly hungry but they brought back some appetite I didn't have before so now I get hunger signals again even after stopping the meds. I don't have set times to eat. I eat when I feel hungry. It's harder to stop though because I usually just eat once a day and when it's all gone I can put it out of my head. Otherwise it haunts me. So I have to buy food for each day separately of I eat it all.

I try to eat healthy things but alcohol screws it all up. 

Personally, when I was trying to gain I did count calories to make sure I had enough.

Now that I’ve had time to think about it,  I want to say that maybe eating intuitively isn’t the right thing in early recovery.  In early recovery, I don’t remember feeling “hungry” and in order to eat intuitively, you must be in tune with your body’s hunger cues.  In my own early recovery, I simply followed the meal plan given to me by my treatment plan.  I ate the amount of food they said I should eat at the intervals/times they said I should eat.  My meal plan prescribed eating 4 times a day, so that’s what I did.  Now (many years later), I eat intuitively.

I think it’s incredible difficult to ever really completely accept one’s weight and eat without any kind of anxiety, even for people who have never had an eating disorder that sort of healthy eating mindset and guilt is there, but especially for us in recovery.

I think recovery is an always thing, you’re always building and maintaining a positive relationship with food and with your body, and that’s always going to take work. I think it also gets /easier/ as time goes on though! I try and stay away from health diets and stuff because i think a lot of them are fake anyway and are trying to profit off me and that i don’t want to get too close to slipping into old habits.

Working out is good (ish?) but i try to do it with friends so they can watch me and know i’m not overdoing it.

Try to think about how you felt about yourself before hearing your weight, and remember that you’re still that same person and that one number doesn’t define you.

It’s a new country with new foods. The trip, that’s what you will remember. Don’t let it be something where you look back on it and only think “oh yeah, that trip was miserable, that was when I was in a poor mental place.” 

Things are still focused around weight for you. They will be for a while, that’s the unfortunate nature of an eating disorder. Moving the reference point away from weight is difficult. Sometimes the best first step is to catch yourself every time you think this way. Instead of “I’ll gain weight there,” think of the new food experiences you’ll be having. You can even remove food from the thought entirely. 

I know this probably isn’t constructive help. I guess what I’m intending to say here is that you need to identify problematic themes (like a fear of weight gain) in your thoughts and adopt a new perspective. Weight, or new food experiences?

I don't want to be insensitive, but I do not believe that you have an eating disorder. The thing that sticks out to me is that you say you are never hungry; usually people with eating disorders are suffering extreme hunger constantly. Everything you have described sounds largely physical and I hope you can get some help from a doctor because it sounds like you are really suffering.",luceario,1564186972.0,2019-07-26 19:22:52,"I don’t know that I agree with this. My eating disorder spirals start with not feeling hungry at all and just skipping meals because I generally have no interest in food, and then it becomes obsessive and I find that when I want to eat I physically cannot, and then eventually I realise that I don’t want to eat and my massive anxiety about eating causes physical symptoms in my body akin to the fight or flight response which for me presents as an aversion to eating and the tendency to pace/fidget a lot which encourages weight loss further. 

So basically, the fight-or-flight anxiety response I get as a result of being presented with food creates physical symptoms which make me not want to/not able to eat. It’s a tough spiral because it’s hard to force yourself to eat when you simultaneously do not want to eat mentally or physically.",theunicornbort,1564222982.0,2019-07-27 05:23:02,"That sounds like a horrible spiral.

I have been in starvation mode many times where my body doesn't respond to food correctly (refeeding), but I can't remember a time when I haven't wanted to eat.

You can also sometimes deconstruct what you were going to make initially, if you find yourself struggling to put it together.

Sadly, I don't have much advice that avoids your distaste for seeing psychologists.  Psychologists are the only type of people trained to help you with this problem.  I'm not sure exactly what you mean by saying that you ""tried it once"" and nothing changed.  Did you see one counselor for a long time and not get results?  Did you go to one session?  Most people will have to see multiple counselors before they find one that works for them, it's a very personal journey.  Technically you can DIY phobia therapy, but your statement of ""This is a hurdle I desperately need and want to get past as I want to lead a normal life again"" indicates to me that this needs to be done the right way.",pavlovsdogsitter,1563613853.0,2019-07-20 04:10:53,"This is something I struggle with, too. Ever since I could remember I would get sick at restaurants or eating in public. I would never eat lunch at school or if I did, I would eat in the bathroom. I avoid going to restaurants with family and friends because I get extremely nauseated, even if I was so hungry on the way there. I have a lot of anxiety issues so I feel like this definitely stems from that. 

Even though this is something I still struggle with, what I have found helps a little is to order something I know will be ""easy"" on the stomach, like soup, to attempt to eat at the restaurant and then order a main meal and take it to go so I can eat it at home. Or if I'm sure I won't even be able to eat that, I'll eat before going out and only order a drink or maybe a side just to have at the table so it doesn't look like I'm the only one not eating. Worst case scenario, I will take an over-the-counter nausea pill or motion sickness pill before going, but I try my hardest not to do this unless I absolutely feel it is needed because I do not want it to be a habit. 

Although you do not want to see a therapist, confiding in someone you can trust about this issue I feel will help you a lot. In my experience, it's very frustrating going out to a restaurant with friends and having to lie and say ""I'm just not very hungry"" or ""I just ate"" when asked why I'm not eating. If there is at least one person in your life who can understand this is a struggle for you, even if they can't completely understand why, it will help you cope a bit. Don't give up seeing your friends, keep trying. You deserve to have fun and spend time with the people you love. I know it's easier said than done, but taking small steps in the right direction will help. If you do have someone you can trust and confide in, maybe start taking baby steps and going to a small restaurant, even a fast-food restaurant or something, with only that person once in a while. They will know your struggle and understand if you have to leave so there will be no pressure on you. 

I'm sorry if this has been rambly but I hope it helps even a little bit. Good luck with everything and I hope things get better for you. Take it one day at a time :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For me, it's much harder to stop the binge than to stop restricting. So I any time I binged, I would force myself to resume activities as normal, don't compensate, don't purge, don't fast, don't restrict, don't overexercise. Just go about my day/the next few days acting as if nothing happened and try to eat normally.

For a few weeks, I would eat to satiety, sometimes past satiety, sometimes way overeating. But I never compensated, and eventually the urge to binge went away, and now I'm able to sustainably lose weight without fasting and without going crazy and feeling the need to binge. 

Please stop trying to compensate. It's not sustainable. And it doesn't work. You said you gained 12 kg? That's evidence that binge-purge isn't going to work for you. It's much easier to maintain your weight loss if you learn sustainable and healthy habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I only realise how sick I was in hindsight. Throughout the worst of it, I didn’t feel sick at all. My threshold for what constituted being sick enough kept shifting. If anything, it became a target.

It’s good that you’re seeing someone, but focusing on both your trauma and your ED would be ideal, especially if the two are linked in your case.

Are you making yourself go for prolonged periods of time without food (intermittent fasting or not allowing snacks when you want them) that cause low blood sugar or mental hunger? These behaviors often lead to binges.

Do you work weekends? If not, maybe try going then? I’ve also heard about online therapy.. but I’m not sure about that. I have every little knowledge on it. It seems like a night appointment would be difficult to come across, but, if you haven’t already, try reaching out directly to the counseling company/building! Maybe they could work something out for you! If not, maybe you could ask your employer about an hour break each week? I know that’s probably really anxiety provoking to do (it would be for me), and Im not sure who you work for/what kind of company/business, so they not not even allow that? There’s always options though! Also, just a little tip. Don’t force yourself to like your therapist (if/when you get one). If it’s uncomfortable and you want a different one, please speak up. I’m such a shy person, and it took me ages to finally say something. There are plenty out there and that doesn’t mean you think they’re a bad therapist! Sometimes it just doesn’t click.

I’d also recommend paying a lot of attention to your body signals - what does hunger feel like for you? Important note: actually physical stomach pain and feeling like you’re lightheaded is not hunger, that is being famished, and means you should have eaten earlier. I’m still learning how to recognize hunger in my body. It helps to be super specific, as if you were explaining it to an alien studying the human race. I learned that from “Eating in the Light of the Moon.” Tabitha Farrar and the Eating Disorder Institute have great info about “mental hunger” and “emotional eating” as well.

I have known a lot of people like this. 
These situations happen a lot:

I go out to eat with a few friends, and they complain the whole time while eating how fat they are and how they are going to work off this food later that day and how they are so full and how effortlessly thin I must be since I'm eating the same food as them. But they eat this way all the time, and they always cry while they eat this way, all while continuing to eat.

They say stuff like ""im going on a diet tomorrow."" Or ""I'm totally fasting tonight."" 

Sometimes, after going out to eat, some people I am with won't finish their food while I polish off my whole plate, and they all make comments like ""wow how did you eat that much? But you are so thin. I wish I was thin like you and could eat this much. "" like bitch, I still have room to eat your face off.

Or like, Thanksgiving day when you are allowing yourself to eat and everyone is griping about how much weight they are gaining and how they can't stop. 

They start a new diet (like paleo) and all they can talk about is how good they feel and all the weight they've lost. 

Basically, a lot of American women (and men) have very poor body image and an unhealthy relationship with food, which they voice and often can often gain sympathy from those around them. This is really triggering to those of us who are disordered, especially if we are working really hard to eat.

Going to therapy can help. Talking about the triggering things people say helps. Also, if you feel comfortable, you can ask these people not to talk about these things in front of you. They may or may not respect your request.

Either way, I am sorry you are dealing with this. I know it's hard.",edie43,1564581296.0,2019-07-31 08:54:56,"I know this situation so well... honestly, what I’ve started doing is just being vocal about how I don’t like us talking like that about ourselves.

Now, I’m 27 and I understand that this might not be easy for a 19yo, so in your case maybe you should try and talk to the director or something? Someone who people listen to who can talk to the group and maybe make a rule to lay off the diet talk and triggering behaviour? They don’t have to know it’s you.

During my freshman year of college, I put on weight (mostly from being less active than I was in high school and adding alcohol and 'unhealthy' eating to my 'routine'). I felt uncomfortable in my body cause I had never been at that weight before in my life. However, instead of trying to make my old clothes 'work' and chastising myself when they didn't fit, I wound up buying new clothes that actually felt good to wear. 

As I got older, I started partying less and had a healthier (both mentally and physically) relationship with food. Naturally, I wound up losing a bit of weight, going back down to a more 'normal' weight at which my body is most comfortable, I'd say. 

Long story short, your weight fluctuates and that's okay! Just try to make yourself as comfortable as possible and try to appreciate all of the changes your body goes through--it does so much for you to keep you out and about and healthy!

In all, genetic factors play a significant causal role, explaining roughly seventy percent of individual variation in BMI.

The dominant theory of how genetic predisposition works is the ""set point"" theory of obesity. Set point theory posits that genetic determinants set a target weight around which the body will establish an equilibrium. Biological processes, including metabolism and hormonal signaling, significantly impede people from altering their weight. Individuals can still exert reasonable control over their weight within a certain range of their natural set point. Outside this range, however, it is extremely difficult to maintain weight changes.

That is not to say, however, that the set point theory denies individual variation. There is no single genetic determinant of weight. Hundreds of specific genes have already been studied, and researchers estimate that thousands of genes may ultimately influence one's genetic predisposition. The process of maintaining homeostatic equilibrium certainly differs between individuals. Some people will have strong homeostatic regulation around their set point whereas others may have very weak regulation. That is, although genetic variation explains seventy percentage of weight variation, genes may be more or less determinative for any particular individual.”

Your parents care about you, they will sacrifice a lot for your benefit—believe me they already have. You don't need to work hard to get them on-side, but it does sound like you need a better plan.

I would also not encourage the second recommendation to check the ingredients and to do extensive background.

You are in the wrong.

The issue is not the cookies or the trigger foods or really, any foods. The issue is with you, and it goes by the name: eating disorder. You are responsible for your recovery, no one else. You can let others in on your journey, but they are only support. Unless you are a minor, in which case parents often play a helpful “force feeding” role to get their children to nutritional rehabilitation, you are the only person who needs to be on board in order to recover. Is it harder? Yes. Is it worth it? Entirely and then some. 

You will rarely ever have the perfect situation and environment to recover. You must recover in spite of, not because of.

I do not believe that for those recovering from restrictive/compensatory eating disorders, binges ever occur in isolation. They are our body desperately trying to restore energy balance and reverse energy debt. What is wrong is not the binges - what’s wrong is the restriction that precipitates them, and the compensatory behaviors that follow (exercise, purging, laxative abuse, etc).  These restrictive and compensatory behaviors encourage the cycle you so hate. If you want to stop binging, you have to let yourself eat, sit with the discomfort, and not restrict/compensate IN ANY WAY. Eventually, your body will stop triggering binges.

So sorry you are going through this (and these comments are NOT helping! You have an illness. People should be more comapssionate). 

I know throwing out their food is tempting, especially since you intend to do it in order to keep yourself feeling safer. I suffer from anorexia nervosa b/p subtype, and my parents for some time, encouraged my binge behavior because I am underweight. Being around certain trigger foods (cereal, specifically) was causing me such distress. Binging and purging everyday while they went to their full time jobs. 

I sat both of them down and tried to put it in a different perspective, I said ""I feel like I'm in a prison with my worst enemy, and I'm all alone during the day, with urges to hurt myself all because of a box of Froot Loops. I know you like them, but is there a way to maybe remove them from my general sightline?"" My parents were very resistant and eventually obliged. I asked them to hide them for me, for now, until my b/p behavior is under control. I've asked that if I want cereal, they portion it for me. They still are able to eat what they like, and I don't have to fixate on it all day since I'm by myself here. 

Try telling them the dangers of b/p-ing, and how you can not fight it alone. Please try not to throw their food away. Your feelings may be hurt if one of your safe foods was thrown away, right? I hope they can be agreeable. Do not be afraid to tell them some of your fears. Sometimes people don't realize the
emotional distress that ED causes us. Prayers to you my friend. One day you'll be able to safely enjoy these things that are scaring you atm.",ACatNamedLuna,1565312084.0,2019-08-08 19:54:44,"This!!

I agree with what was said above-can you tell them to keep them 100% hidden from you? I don’t mean just place them on a different shelf (because if I am in a binge, I know where to look) but completely off your radar. Don’t let you see them coming home from the store, don’t tell you they have them, etc. It is so hard for people who don’t suffer from EDs to understand what a trigger food is, but maybe this could be a decent compromise between throwing the food away and having it available to you 24/7.

It depends on where you are in your recovery. When I started in the recovery process, I purposely took my meds in the morning when I knew there was a highly unlikely chance I would purge.

Without knowing the medication I couldn’t be able to tell you what the release time of your medications are.

It may be good to see how you do without knowing your weight and understanding how much a number (your weight) can add to issues like body dismorphia. If you are concerned about being underweight, many gyms have scales in changing rooms and you could stick to weighing yourself once a week or two weeks, but tbh weigh-ins are much more useful when monitored by doctors or dieticians as if you suffer from an ED, weight can be triggering. Think about this: you want a scale to know if you are underweight, but if you find that you are underweight what actions will you take? Get help? Try to eat more? Try to stop purging? The last two if simply based off of a low number on a scale will not be sustainable. Lots of colleges have guidance councillors that you may be interested in accessing.

Congratulations on recognising an issue and I wish you the best :)",bluegingersnap,1565856262.0,2019-08-15 03:04:22,"Seconding the scale thing. It’s tough, but it’s kept me steady.",adriftingpieceofdust,1565873190.0,2019-08-15 07:46:30,"First, it is a very good sign that you are reaching out for advice/help! No matter how small, it is the first step to recognising that there IS an issue and you want to recover. You don’t want to live your whole life struggling with an ED, no matter what that ED voice might say.  

Do not buy a scale! It can be very triggering. I know you want to make sure you don’t fall into the underweight category which is very bad and unhealthy, but there are other methods such as ensuring that you eat breakfast, lunch and dinner with snacks in between and making sure they are substantial. Don’t count calories if it triggers you or makes you obsessed with numbers. The urge to purge is also something you have to fight and account for, especially now that you’re living away from home. You are your own support system, and if you make any close friends you can trust, you can have them support you as you recover too. 

I’m in my second year of college now, and it was difficult at the beginning. I thought I could take the chance being away from everyone monitoring me to relapse into my old ED habits. But it also feels horrible to miss out on all the other exciting opportunities that university can offer, and all the socialising and friends you can meet. So at the start I pushed it all aside, and forced myself to take the first step by joining in all my university hall activities and suppers. Then it slowly got easier and I definitely feel a lot happier now that I’m letting myself live. 

It is definitely not an easy thing. I still struggle sometimes. But what is most important is acknowledging that you can not, and don’t want to live trapped inside your disorder forever. This is really what motivated me to take steps in my recovery independently. There is so much university life can offer, and I know you are brave enough to take that first scary step, and continue to fight against your disorder.

I try to remind myself when those comments are made that it's my ED twisting it and it's not what the person intended. It's frustrating when even the slightest of comments gets twisted in our minds, but you are not alone. It's a daily struggle for me. 

I also get the feeling of compensation. Something I also deal with everyday. I tell myself I need to fast to make up for it, go for a run, work out harder, etc. When I have those thoughts I just take a minute to remind myself that it's ok to enjoy the foods I love with the people I love. The chance to make memories is something you can't get back. I also wonder what its like to not fixate so much on food, but those things take time.

Please don't fast. I don't know how to put this lightly, but without proper nourishment you are more and more likely to be disillusioned by simple events and situations like this. It becomes so hard to separate yourself from the ED when you are too weak to even think logically. I am in no way trying to put your intelligence down for what happened, i have just been in the same situation and I wish someone had been there to tell me this. Just eating alone will not solve your eating disorder, but it will finally give you the energy to have the mental leg up you need to begin seriously finding ways to cope long term with this illness, without indulging in eating disordered behaviors. Find someone you trust, tell them you desperately need them to sit with you and eat a meal, or three, or seventeen. However many you can manage.  I promise you, you will begin to feel better and think stronger and more clearly. Your emotions will become more balanced as well, and you will be able to tackle issues and situations that you physically do not have the energy for now. 

Because eating disorders affect your mental *and* physical well-being so intensely, they are like snowballs, rolling both up and down. When you start going down, it becomes increasingly harder to turn around. However when you start going up, it becomes easier and easier to keep going. The hardest part is deciding and sticking to the decision that you want to turn around. 

Wishing you the best. You are not alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm sorry to hear about what you are going through, sounds like it's affecting your life to a great extent.   
One thing about EDs is that they don't have to look a single way and can be expressed differently in different people. Second thing is that one does not choose to be anorexic the same way as one does not choose to have cancer.. so no matter how much one might ""want"" or ""not-want"" to be anorexic its not up to them to decide, yet if you do develop the illness you can choose to fight for yourself and your health. 

As your post title mentions - the idea of control seems to be the key to your struggles. Correct me if I'm wrong: do you think that the intention behind restricting and vomiting is to gain control of your body? Do you internally believe that controlling what goes into your stomach is almost the only thing you have the ability to control right now? If you do, is it a rational belief? Does it have an objective explanation?

If so than you might benefit from uncovering why is the idea of control so overpowering? It might lie in insecurities, perfectionism, lack of control in other areas of life. There are so many factors and seeing a school counsellor might help in uncovering the roots.

If you have never tried to explore what exactly prompts you to restrict or purge, I would highly recommend trying to do Behaviour Chain Analysis - its a super useful tool to help you uncover emotions and triggers behind ineffective behaviours. Yes, it would require you to do some thinking, require you to do the work, it might be very uncomfortable, but it's helpful.

One huge suggestion is that you shouldn’t glorify the idea of testosterone as a solution to all your problems (not saying you are, just in case you were headed in that direction). If you continue to let your eating disorder grow, HRT might help alleviate it slightly, but deeply rooted behaviors and mindsets will continue to haunt you. In my opinion it really just seems like you need to find better coping mechanisms (which is easier said then done, I know, but you have to work for it). Although it isn’t the best way to navigate recovery, in your case it can help to view weight gain and eating as a gateway to gaining more muscle mass. If you gain more muscle, your physique will no doubt start to seem a little more masculine, instead of the lean, slim curves that being really skinny gives you. Trust me, gaining weight (and gaining muscle) can help you feel more comfortable in your body than being skinny and malnourished ever will.  I really wish you the best and when it comes down to it, it’s all about making slow steps towards fighting for yourself and the better life you deserve away from your eating disorder.",seatangle,1565662445.0,2019-08-12 21:14:05,"I guess a good step is to talk to someone about it.

I’m not trans but a queer, masc-presenting non-binary AFAB person (that was a mouthful, lol). But I get not feeling like my body is what I want it to be. You’ve got great insight recognizing that this could be why you’ve developed ED behaviors. It took me years and years to realize that my ED could be connected to gender dysphoria. So I think you are on the right track being self aware and wanting to do something about it.",creativeaidan,1565664264.0,2019-08-12 21:44:24,"In addition to what the other commenters are saying, you can take some temporary control over your body by using things like binders and packers. If you don't know/don't already have one, binders are specialized articles of clothing that compress your chest so it looks flatter/more masc. My favorite place to get them is gc2b - check them out if you haven't!

Packers can help some people with ""down there"" dysphoria, because some look very realistic and can make it look like you have a masculine bulge in your pants. 

These things might help alleviate your dysphoria and give you back some confidence and love for your body, but neither they nor testosterone are cure-alls. Your ED will likely find any reason it can why you need to purge and restrict, so getting nutrition counseling and therapy (with a trans-affirming therapist!!) ASAP is essential.

Feel free to PM me (AFAB, non binary, and in long term recovery from anorexia) if you want to talk more.",rainsfriend,1565960224.0,2019-08-16 07:57:04,"You're not alone on this. I'm FTM agender, and dysphoria can often act as a trigger for eating disorders. 

My best advice is to listen to yourself. If you're having a bad dysphoria day, learn to recognize the signs of it and treat yourself with kindness. On the hard days, wear the clothes that make you feel the best and eat foods that are easy and stay away from mirrors (if that helps you). Maybe look at affirmations or meditate or do whatever it is that calms and centers you. 

As previously mentioned, binding and packing might help. If you can't get a binder, sometimes wearing a sports bra a size too small can compress breasts just enough to take the edge off of the dysphoria.

Good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
269,cp7bpr,Fuckmenumb,1565589071.0,2019-08-12 00:51:11,"I'm sorry you're going through this. Families can be the most triggering in my experience.

 I've learned that I need to separate myself from what I call ""eating disorder energy"". I can smell it a mile away on someone. Sometimes to protect yourself you have to limit time with people who are clearly suffering. This isn't to say I'm not there to help or listen if someone wants it! But EDs are tricky and you can't help someone who's not ready. Protect yourself as much as you can. Family can be hard though, esp if you live at home. 

I think your response will depend a lot on your relationship with your family, or individual members.
I'm more comfortable being direct with my dad than my mom. So with my dad I asked him not to comment on my weight, even if it's weight loss. He had no idea he had been impacting me at all with comments for years. I didn't elaborate, I just said ""hey, I struggle with weight fluctuations. I appreciate compliments but it would be a lot easier on me if you just didn't mention my weight, positive or negative.""

My mom is too deep in her own disordered eating and very passive so that wouldn't work. With her I just don't acknowledge comments about food, weight, or diet. Or I respond with ""huh"" and change the subject. I refuse to validate those comments. 

I might consider mentioning to your mom how all this focus on food and her diet kind of ends up making you feel bad about your body. Finding a way to share that her intense fixation affects other people. Sometimes people don't realize they are having an effect on others in that way. 

When I HAVE to hear triggering things I mentally review personal experiences that validate how unhelpful and draining that thinking is. I think about my list of positive experiences since recovery.

Honestly the biggest thing for me through this whole process has been just accepting that I'm gonna be uncomfortable and anxious, but that doesn't mean I get to try to do anything about it. You do have to believe that it will all sort itself out, but I feel like sometimes when I think about that I just imagine a future where my weight has naturally gone back down for some reason or where I magically feel comfortable in my own skin without putting the work in. So I just tell myself, yes this sucks and it's hard to trust that I'm doing the right thing by eating enough and what I want, and I may not look how I wanna look, but I'm just gonna have to live with how uncomfortable I feel in that moment. It's not permanent. You'll always have bad days, but those moments are not permanent. Just trust that you're doing the right thing. Because you ARE. And I'm telling myself this too--it's likely that many people won't notice any difference when you go back to school, and if some people that are close to you do, they'll probably also notice the good things that recovery has brought you--for me, I've been much less irritable, haven't been isolating myself, I have energy for things besides overexercizing, I care about myself more, I care about my friends and family more...

Try learning to cook so you are more aware of your food and what you like to eat. As you fight your thoughts it becomes easier to listen to your body’s hunger signals.

So why judge yourself? Your weight or appearance doesn't *really* matter to anyone else but you. Be kind to yourself during times like these, and take comfort in knowing that there *will* be times where your body doesn't look the same all the time.

Do you believe that if you were underweight then you would be more okay with that? I have been quite severely underweight during the course of my ED and I can guarantee you that I had your same exact fears of not being underweight enough to warrant weight gain and more eating.

My advice is to openly and sincerely discuss these concerns with your therapist and your dietitian. They are there precisely to help you in dealing with them. :)",onetimeinalifetime,1566570648.0,2019-08-23 09:30:48,"One thing that helped me is that I don’t know how much I have gained because I no longer have a scale. My doctors don’t tell me my weight either. It is really scary at first, but it is so much easier to except my weight.

In the middle of recovery from AN (B/P subtype) and I've gained about 30lbs while not eating enough that a ""normal"" person would gain. I'm 8 months in and, while the thoughts and body image issues haven't gone away at all, they are far easier to cope with.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the manipulations that EDs put up is that you can only be happy at X weight or if you look like X. But, you already know that it's never going to be good enough for your ED to let you be happy. There's no amount of weight you could lose that would make your life better &amp; improve your body image as long as that ED is hanging around.

&amp;#x200B;

My therapist tells me that it's a matter of rebuilding the trust my body has in me. I've neglected &amp; punished it for so long that it wants to hold onto EVERYTHING I eat because it doesn't know when I'm going to starve it again. Eventually, if you stick with recovery and don't restrict/compensate, your body will settle at its set point. While you don't get to decide what that is, you do have the option of changing the thoughts on your body as it works its way there.

One thing I've found helpful is recognizing when I'm tearing my body apart &amp; forcing myself to redirect the thoughts from ""my legs are massive"" to ""my legs have carried me through half marathons. They get me to class."" and ""this food is going to make me even bigger"" to ""I need this food to help my brain think, my body perform functions to keep me alive, and keep my moods/mental health level.

The only way out is through, but it does get easier with time. I highly, highly recommend reaching out to a therapist, dietician, and/or support group to help get you through this.

I haven't really come to a place where I am super happy about my body all the time, but using those skills helped me get through the worst of the panic and fear about losing control.

I also cut way back on my social media usage and was never really into Instagram. I realized that I really don't have a good sense of what ""normal"" human bodies look like anymore.

I would also give him a time to ask any questions at all. Answering them truthfully, but simplified. Ask him if it might help to make mommy some cards to send (if it’s allowed, I’m not sure but just an idea) to help mommy feel better. Something like that can be very therapeutic. Giving them a certain project or something hands on and tangible to work on can help them cope with things they can’t understand.

274,ctgdru,taylermeagiin,1566395962.0,2019-08-21 08:59:22,"I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Eating disorders are truly a living hell &amp; the fact that you're even reaching out is something incredibly brave that you should be proud fo (even though your ED will absolutely not want you to be).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So now I have gained weight. I am told I look super healthy. I feel so uncomfortable. I have such a hard time accepting it. That I have to eat. That the weight I gained is good. I have to eat though so I don't have anxiety spikes. I saw a friend post about losing weight and my first thought was working out and not eating.

The #1 thing to remember is that this ED is manipulative. It wants to isolate you, refuse to let you have something that you NEED to stay alive, and make you think that it's the only thing that makes sense. It is absolutely not true.

I'm currently in recovery, too, and the weight restoration is rough, man. I feel this. It helps me to think of the weight gain as a ""side effect"" of recovery and focus on the other things you gain once you're not obsessing over food (connections, relationships, having emotions again, etc).

&gt;So I talked to a therapist about it. It feels like I am at the bottom of a mountain right now. I don't even feel like I can say I have an ed. I feel like a fraud. I feel scared when I can't have food. I feel angry at having to eat it. I don't know how to feel about my body. I don't know what's me.

Like I said, this thing is manipulative. It will convince you you need to be more sick to get help, but I promise you that nothing nothing nothing will ever make you ""sick enough"" to feel valid. It will always want more. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a slow, tough process but professional help is the way to go. I have to utilize 2 support groups as well as weekly therapy to stay on track, so I'd suggest reaching out to you therapist more frequently and seeing if ANAD, NEDA, or a local community health center offers support groups near you.

Your first step would be to get one that specializes in eating disorders- she’ll make sure you don’t eat “too much” or “too little”. Anyways personally I stopped counting calories by slowly adding uncounted things into my daily meal, and trying new foods. For example, the first day I had a snack with unknown calories, and the next day it was 2 snack, then all of my snacks were unknown cals. I would occasionally go out to a restaurant too (with a friend) and order something where the calories aren’t listed. So I slowly stopped, and one day after about a week I went completely cold turkey and stopped googling calories/looking at nutrition labels.

I felt super lost without that crutch. I would panic before bed and overestimate everything I was eating. 


Eventually it became super normal and I stopped worrying too much about calories, and managed to lose weight at a much slower pace. 


However, I also started purging more when I realized I ate something that definitely was not a safe food, or was definitely more calories than I needed. I’d sometimes even purge after a normal meal. 


Recently I started heavy restricting again but without counting and it’s a great/weird feeling. Part of the obsession of creating and recreating meals throughout the day is gone, but I’m still super into my eating disorder at the moment. 


Overall, not sure if any of this is helpful, but not counting calories saved me. Truly. There’s been a learning curve for sure, and even though my anxiety and depression are manifesting through my eating disorder at the moment, I swear that not worrying about the calories is the most freeing thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

277,crt1c1,lolaecho,1566114226.0,2019-08-18 02:43:46,"I would say firstly try to prevent any exposure to tumblr or any communities that let you fall into the ED mindset because it can be shocking how quickly it can trigger you. Delete the app, your account, anything that you know will let you access something bad for you. This is a step in taking control away from your ED. 

Also talk to your boyfriend! Just tell him things are getting a little harder again. It is much easier to stop the ED relapses from becoming severe when you catch them at an early stage. Telling people you are struggling makes it so much harder for your ED to control you because you are taking away its power.

Consider maybe gentle exercise that focuses on health rather than weight loss. Too much exercise puts focus on fat loss (Like HIIT or crossfit) when weight loss should not be everyone's end goal because there is more to life. Would sports like team sports, or yoga, or a group dance class appeal to you? It gets your body working like it should be, and can often make you feel healthier but doesn't involve a focus on changing your appearance which I have found helpful. 

However, the fact you are so aware of what triggers you and that you shouldn't be losing weight at this point makes me believe you are strong enough to fight this. Good luck and congratulations for putting your health first (and also for finding such a lovely boyfriend!).

Most parents react to their children's problems by reducing their autonomy, taking a tighter grip on their lives in an attempt to fix their problems. However, EDs cause semi-permanent physiological changes that make it really hard for a person to recover on their own, anorexia can change your brain chemistry to be less sensitive to the dopamine rush people get from food, their micro-bio changes to a state that's less effective at processing food, bulimia can cause brain changes that can cause people to automatically throw up when they eat (or sometimes see) food, binge eating can cause hormonal changes that cause you to be insanely hungry all the time and depressed if you don't eat nearly constantly. Going to your parents probably wasn't necessarily the *best* thing you could've done, but it was probably necessary for her long term health. At this point, all you can really do is try to be there for her, show her that you care, that she can trust you, and that you understand what she's going through. I would also try to do a bunch of research about what people with EDs actually go through, what they do, and the best ways to interact with us, we're not dangerous, but there's a lot of stuff that people say in general conversation that we can find incredibly triggering. For a start you probably shouldn't mention her weight at all, try to avoid talking about dieting or weight loss around her, and defidently don't go around mentioning her flaws (of course you shouldn't treat her like she's fragile or dangerous, she's still the same sister you've always known, she's just going through some stuff right now).",Coliflours,1567284183.0,2019-08-31 15:43:03,"She may be mad now, but trust me, she thank you in the future, this will benefit her in the long run, telling your parents will help them give the help and support she needs, she may not see is at first but in due time she’ll be recovering from it.

281,cw2d8l,48anon,1566907218.0,2019-08-27 07:00:18,"I feel I am in a similar situation and might have a little advice. I had been fit my whole life and was always doing something competitive. I’ve had two kids over the past few years so my body is obviously different. I felt like I was in a good place in recovery (been in recovery 9.5 years) and decided to start weight training. Not body building but I wanted to get very lean and strong. And after about 5 weeks I spiraled into restriction and cutting out food groups entirely and not going out and avoiding social get togethers. I am an all or nothing type person too. It doesn’t make sense in my head to not be that way. But we really need to try. I don’t want to live in a disordered mind set so I stopped my food plan and stopped working out until I wasn’t scared to not do it. It’s been three weeks now and I took measurements and I haven’t changed AT ALL. Which was honestly shocking but proved the point that our bodies can do what we think they can’t. We can skip the gym and be fine. We can eat what we are scared of and be fine. Three weeks of eating my fear foods every single day and NO change happened.

I feel like it’s easier for me because of all the treatment I have gotten in my life. If someone had told me “just stop going to the gym” or “just eat normal food” a couple of years ago, I would have told them it was impossible and that even if I wanted to I couldn’t. I am a firm believer that therapy is the way to go. Every single one of my therapists told me my behaviors were a symptom of something. A very serious symptom, but a symptom. So my advice is to find someone you can talk to. Figure out what is causing this need for control/ obsession/ whatever it is and then work on that. Because it gets more miserable. You can figure out a healthy balance of diet and exercise and not be a prisoner in your mind. I also think you can hit your goals without the bad obsession being there. But first focus on your mental health. I promise it gets easier!",nectarinepit,1566938993.0,2019-08-27 15:49:53,"When you were eating your fear foods were you also eating in a big caloric surplus, or just incorporating them? Did you find yourself losing control or was it relieving? I've had 4 binges over the past 2 weeks on mostly chocolate. First was around (total for the day) 4500 calories, second and third around 3500 calories, and one last night of 2700 calories. I am so fearful of food right now. I have a very obsessive personality and am very all or nothing like you and OP, so when I have a taste of a food I've deemed evil I lose all control quite easily.",48anon,1566943600.0,2019-08-27 17:06:40,"I was just incorporating them. I struggled with anorexia purge type and actually never really binged. I did deal with extreme hunger and ate more but it would not be classified as a binge. The ed was telling me I lost control. But because I’m pretty far along in recovery I was able to “catch it, challenge it, and change it.” So I caught the lie,-“(fear food) is bad,” challenged it- “if this food supposedly makes me fat, why can everyone on earth eat it and it not make them fat?” And changed it- “this is a main food group that gives me energy and I need it to survive. I will not all of a sudden become ‘fat’ from a healthy caloric intake.” 

When I have a fear food and end up wanting to eat it all the time, I put it in my “diet.” I was scared of chocolate too which made me want it ALL the time. So instead of restricting it, I stopped about twice a week and got a chocolate bar. And after a couple of weeks my body realized I wasn’t going to be restricting it anymore and stopped craving it. But I can’t stop eating chocolate altogether because I’ll become fearful of it again. So if I want it I’ll eat it. Exposure will be a great thing! It’s terrifying but it gets easier!

Our bodies fluctuate! So what if you gain weight? Logistically, why is it a traumatic feeling? What bad thing will happen? (As long as you are in a healthy range). I’ll tell you my experience- I was underweight so I gained a lot of weight over the years. I also gained my personality, a sense of humor, friends, freedom, I was able to carry two kids, I got married, I can walk and not have to sit, I can play outside with my family, etc. Weight is just a number. It doesn’t change who you are if it goes up or down. And I promise you will like who you are once the ed is silenced. I was so scared I wouldn’t like who I was without it. But that’s a lie. 

Do you have a treatment team? Or a therapist? The cycle of restricting and binging is exhausted and very very hard physically and mentally.",nectarinepit,1566947651.0,2019-08-27 18:14:11,"I wonder if I've ever experienced extreme hunger. I'm not really sure. When I go on a binge I eat until I feel sick. It can take a lot for me to feel satiated at times, but when I get a taste of a food I don't let myself eat I lose control and eat it beyond comfort. It won't even taste great anymore, and I'll become bloated and in pain. 

I became very into fitness a few years ago after losing a lot of weight naturally from eating less (granted, I was still eating a lot of processed junk food) and figured the next step was actually getting my butt to the gym and whipping my nutrition into shape. My weight was a healthy 145lbs for my 5'8.5 height and I was called skinny quite frequently. About 8 months ago I started losing more weight and becoming leaner and leaner through diet and exercise and am around 125lbs now - borderline underweight. I still get called skinny, but now when friends and family say it it's with concern. I finally feel confident in my body though, and am so scared of losing that confidence and becoming overweight again, which I was for most of my life. Even at 145lbs I didn't see myself as skinny like people said. I still don't really see myself as skinny and although I'm not actively trying to, I wouldn't be bothered by losing more weight. 

I haven't been able to incorporate any heavily processed foods into my diet in moderation, but would really like to. I just started eating peanut butter again instead of the powdered stuff and increased my calories to 1800, but I have so much work left to do. Peanut butter is healthy but because it's calorically dense I was so scared of it. I still kind of am because I find myself eating it out of the jar quite often since including it in my diet. Not usually a crazy amount, but still not a good habit. It would be nice to have just one bowl of sugary cereal, or one chocolate bar if I'm really feeling like it. I don't typically get cravings though, I think it's just my body having been starved and over exercised for so long that it uses the junk food as an excuse to go crazy. It's really hard to tell if it's because my body is craving energy dense foods, or because of my restriction, or a combination of the two. I've really lost who I am to maintaining a lean physique and being skinny. I'm grumpy and no fun to be around. I have no energy and feel like a zombie most of the time walking laps outside to hit my 12k step goal. I'm 23 and have no energy to dance with friends at a club, or won't go out to eat, and any events involving food make me incredibly anxious.

I don't have any professional help with this, but recently opened up more to my sister. I find it easy to discuss with friends, but feel incredibly ashamed to tell my family for some reason. They all seem to be doing so well, I can't see them having struggled with something like this and really understanding, and I know it breaks their hearts to see me in pain. I have my first counselling session next month which I've had to wait a while for. I hope that can help. It isn't a specialist or anything though, but a free counselling session through my family doctor.

Thank you for such a detailed response, and sorry for the novel! The past 2 weeks have been especially hard on me with the bingeing and trying not to restrict. Usually I do better than this and don't binge so much.  I desperately want to restrict today and be done at the 850 calories I've eaten. It feels like a failure to not restrict because then I haven't fixed the damage.  Fortunately I've depleted all of my junk stash which I won't be replacing. I was hoarding so much junk for so long that I wouldn't let myself eat. I'm really hoping the counseling session next month is of use. I know I'll be a better me again, the me I was before, if I can get this stuff under control.",48anon,1566950052.0,2019-08-27 18:54:12,"It sounds like an unhealthy obsessed and fear. I obviously can’t diagnose or tell you what you’ve been doing is binging or whatever. But I can tell you are more than stressed about this. And don’t apologize! You are welcome to pm me any time! I wouldn’t view that as “damage.” I might view it as your body needs more food. So by restricting more, it’s only going to get worse. And that’s great you are going to see a counselor! I think it will help! You can also look for free groups in your area. That’s where I started before my family found out. And I’m like you in that’s sense- I will tell a complete stranger my entire life story but I am not at all comfortable talking to my family about anything. But living in food hell is awful. You need some guidance while you try to figure out behaviors. You might need more help than a counselor. It’s awkward telling your family but they will eventually find out anyway if you just get more sucked into it. That’s what happened to me. But multiple treatment centers and 9.5 years later, it’s a lot easier!",nectarinepit,1567003041.0,2019-08-28 09:37:21,"Definitely. I live day-to-day scared of the food I do or don't eat and what it may or may not do to me which is no way to live. Typically I'm only very scared and anxious after a binge though, or in a circumstance where a binge could happen. As long as I don't touch that one chip, or one chocolate, I feel VERY in control. I'm struggling with this while also trying to be fit and athletic, which means eating a lot of protein to build muscle, but not having enough energy to be my best in the gym, or not eating enough protein because I don't want to sacrifice one favorite meal for a higher protein one because all food I eat feels so valuable and limited. I am also waaaaay too ingrained in routine. It's also no way to live when I want to avoid time with family or friends that may involve food, or showing up and eating nothing because I can't trust myself to not lose it and eat until I feel sick. I remember eating the veggie tray and burger toppings with mustard and salsa at a family birthday party BBQ not long ago. I must have looked so weird...

This really is food hell! I'm glad you were able to escape it. My sister has told me I can always tell her if i'm feeling out of control on either ends - wanting to binge, or wanting to restrict. A few days ago when I had my chocolate binge I didn't say anything despite thinking about that food for a good hour beforehand...I still feel embarrassed but my family just wants to help. Not sure I'll ever tell my parents. I don't think they'd know how to help in an effective way. I always feel like I have things mostly under control, and things won't get worse, but you never know :/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know how awful it can feel and how much it can shape your reality. It's something that you can't unfortunately do on your own, if you have people you can reach out to and people you can talk to professionally I would do so asap, you deserve to be happy and have a fulfilling life that isn't weighed down by your ED.   
Even though the thoughts feel all consuming they will calm down soon, I had something very similar happen to me recently and I've been spending my time reaching back out and doing activities I enjoy that don't involve how I look, like walking my dog and writing.  
If self care is something you're comfortable with consider that as well (things that are separate from triggers), something like a face mask, make up routine, jewelry, nice underwear, new shoes, really anything that doesn't focus on your body for now.

I know how you feel, it is hard not weighing oneself ritually. I once did a little body dysmorphia exercise with my therapist: She wanted me to estimate how long my waist is with a string of wool and she kept it for a week. I remember being fucking terrified. All I could think about was how I guessed it incorrectly, that I did not take enough of the string and that I will embarrass myself in front of everyone (I do group therapy) when we will reveal our real measurements. So, the day came and she took some wool and put it around my waist: she even added 1cm (about half an inch I guess). The reveal was, that I overestimated my waist-length by far too much. I think by 4-5 cm (which makes a lot of a diffrence).  So whenever I feel disgusted by my body, I remember the test (or do it by myself again).

One thing I've tried to constantly remind myself is that regardless of how much weight I put on, I'm still who I am - just a bit chubbier and rounder. But that doesn't make me less of a person, or less lovable. My body needs this certain amount of food at the moment and that's fine. I am feeding myself and that's okay.

When I get these random panics over how my body has changed, I try to divert my attention to something else. This could be focusing on my breathing, listening to my favourite song or grounding myself in my immediate surroundings. What colors do I see, what sounds am I hearing? 

I recommend reading Appetite by Caroline Knapp, it's not a quick fix but it will help you rethink your relationship with food and your body. It really helped me during my recovery and I hope it helps you too!

The structure of the ward seemed really poorly put together, I would switch doctors constantly, I was held in the ward way longer than I should have been and a doctor straight lied to my face. It was very sketchy. I think especially for juveniles, there is not much adequate and even less good treatment options for eating disorders. It's sadly just an area that has little medical research or widespread treatment options. And they are especially not organized, where they do exist. Your experience is not abnormal, unfortunately. I feel for you. I struggled for many years after inpatient. It is certainly not a magical cure all.

The most important thing for you to do is focus on yourself right now. I wish I could offer more specific advice but truly you are your worst enemy, but also your best help. Try to learn to turn the mean voice inside yourself into a positive one, or at least to tune it out.

A guy pouring your drink down is terrible. I've had staff take away my food too.

I’ve been at a few establishments and although some are better, there are reasons they can’t make it too campy. I know a lot of people rely on inpatient because it gives them a sense of stability, a disconnect from their actual reality (home/work life), they make friends and they can abandon responsibility when they’re in care. There’s also the whole aspect of competitiveness where people tend to try and rack up the most IP stays to he the best anorexic. Basically, I feel as though because anorexia is a very action driven mental illness they try and limit the amount of positive reinforcement when it comes to that behaviour.

Overall, most of my experiences were horrible and it definitely encouraged me to stay « healthy enough » to stay out of the hospital but it took me way too long to learn proper habits because i wasn’t taught them in the hospital. If you received no counselling I don’t believe they were properly equipped to have people with ED’s. In general, any inpatient program should have psychologists and I’m so sorry that wasn’t provided for you. I hope you have someone outside the hospital to provide you with proper help and if not you should seriously consider it. 

When it comes to certain protocols, a lot of them are universal for eating disorders. Leaving the door a crack open while someone stays at the door while you pee is super normal in hospital world and in some places you get to earn the privilege to pee on your own lol. Same goes for showers. It’s uncomfortable but girls would definitely purge otherwise and they still try to work that rule. 

Workers tend to be desensitized when it comes to people in wards if they’ve been there for so long. I’m sorry people lost patience with you but you also need to be determined to try your best to recover. You’re still very young, I was sick at your age too and I deeply wish I had realized younger that I had more to offer the world than trying to be skinny.

I've only ever gone to inpatient treatment voluntarily (I've always been over 18), so my experiences are different than being forced to go, but I've still had run ins nurses, therapists, and CRCs who, despite being entrusted with your care, don't give a flying fuck about you. It's so beyond discouraging to a patient in such a vulnerable place like that to realize the person with total authority over you and your treatment is actually disdainful of you.

Do keep this in mind though: a psych ward in a hospital is leagues different from a dedicated eating disorder treatment centre. I've been a patient in both, and psych wards are not about treatment, they're about warehousing you and keeping you alive. It's shitty, and now how we should be treated, but it is different than going to a facility where the focus is patient recovery. People tend to give a shit, there.

Have you asked for personal therapy? Would your parents find you a therapist of you did? It would really be worth it to start. A therapist would even help you sort out these disappointing encounters with the mental health care system.

And as someone who's been 15 and compelled into treatment, let me say that it is worth it to recover, even to try. I'm in my late 20s and still not completely recovered, but treatment helped me.

You are a wonderful, valuable person - a walking miracle for having bravely agreed to confront the beast called ""ed"".  

I have had AN for 13 years, and it was after a very loving intervention by my fam that I went to ED trx. last June 2018. It took me 75 days to get home, and I learned so much about myself and about the positives and negatives of treatment.  I am thankful for:

* their ability to weight-restore me from a very, very severe point.
* the love and care that went into the acute area of my treatment; I felt all the things you feel, but there was so much care put into the patients that it is easy to forget the ""non-rosy"" aspects of that time.
* the friendships I made - by far, the best gift of all.
* progress; no, I am not ""over"" it, but I am so, so much stronger.

Where I falter in being thankful (aka, what freaked me out, lol):

* how much hate and anger exists toward Eds by the professionals - which they should! - but how it can feel *almost* directed at you, the patient. (not so, but how it FEELS).
* the feeling that you're in prison and a second-class human. Constant humiliation. I even asked the director if the goal was to ""be like the military...break you down hardcore, then try to build you up?"" -- she was one of the best MDs I've ever had, and she said ""uh, no!"" -- but I think she doesn't realize how horrible it can be and feel.
* how black/white the thinking of the facility can be, despite us all knowing that black-white thinking is the affliction that can fuel an ED. (ex: ""you will never recover if you dip your apples in yogurt. That is a behavior! Stop that immediately!""...patient thinks: ""I'll just never recover because that's the least thing I do wrong in my ED. Oh well."")

While I was at Trx. I met some AMAZING, walk-on-water professionals. That was the most valuable gift, other than the friendships I made with my peers. The professionals always had this motto to share with us: ""Take what you can use, and leave the rest.""  

That is the advice I give ALL of us! Even non-ED sufferers. In life, you're going to encounter amazing moments in places that also have flaws and scars. Like all of us, nothing is perfect. Even if it's like 95% imperfect, try to take what you can out of the situation, and don't worry about the other stuff. Chalk up the bad things to just not being helpful, but don't let that detract you from the good that is to be had.  

Of course there are exceptions, but if you are in a situation where you are truly choosing the best option possible-- even if it's being in a psych ward - - try to say a prayer or meditation to your faith power, and say ""Let me please get what I am supposed to receive from this program. Even if it is one thing only, please let me recognize it and appreciate it."" -- 

There are LOTS of good treatment places, but those same places are also regarded as ""horrible"" by other people who either genuinely had an exceptionally bad situation OR people who have not realized the philosophy above. :-)  Try your best, leave the rest, and keep fighting HARD. You're so beautiful on your own - you don't need an ED to identify you. You're much more than some BS ed, and your life is precious.

292,d30rmx,Soleska,1568296550.0,2019-09-12 08:55:50,"Some information ahead: Battled with anorexia and bulimia for the past 8 years, having had disordered eating habbits pretty much all of my teen years (am now 23), but due to stress, self-hate and antidepressants I gained a significant amount of weight in 2015, which I lost in 2016/2017 thanks to a better relationship with food and picking up sports again. I've been nearly 2 years b/p free until a short phase of orthorexia in 2018 which then again triggered my bulimia. Am now some months completely free, some months b/p weekly.

&amp;#x200B;

My advice would be to first work on your relationship with food, as losing weight is 80% food, 20% sports. For me it is helpful to incorporate some snack foods/unhealthy foods in my daily intake because that is what can trigger a binge (cravings in combination with stress). And I managed to limit myself pretty good.  
Pick up a sport you like, e.g. weight lifting, running, etc etc etc. That is my next drive. I lift regularly and pretty heavy. If I were to b/p more often or starve, I'd lose all of my accomplishments. So I'll always eat a certain amount of food, even on rest days.  
I also try to move as much as possible (i.e. 10,000 steps per day) but also give my body the rest it needs.

In general, losing weight with an ed is all about balance. You'll need to have a good self-awareness (mind &amp; body) or else you'll get back into disordered eating (from my experience). Also note that weight loss won't be as ""easy"" as it is for other people, meaning you'll probably plateau a lot or it'll take forever to lose just a small amount of weight. I've been yo-yoing for the past 4 months, gaining weight on the weekends and losing it during the week. But that won't stop me (Disclaimer: I'm at a healthy weight and don't intend on getting to an unhealthy weight).",mermaidmagick,1568328971.0,2019-09-12 17:56:11,"I would suggest with working with a dietician or psychologist/social worker/counselor/etc if you have the ability to do so.  I have been in recovery for 9 years but it is still very hard even though I am now considered overweight/obese.  I have found Health At Every Size/Intuitive Eating to be very helpful. Things that have also helped me are the Noom program because it is less rooted in weight loss and more psychology and I’ve found it more gentle than Weight Watchers/CICO.   Programs like Intermittent Fasting/One Meal A Day/kero seem way too triggering to me.   

The bottom line is that you need to work on your relationship with food but also whatever issues drew you to ED in the first place.  My issue was unchecked anxiety and low self esteem.  Keep in touch with yourself and be gentle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you are asking us if you should talk to a professional about your feelings and eating habits, my answer is definitely yes. Whether your concerning habits are from an ED, anxiety, depression, PTSD, or any other mental disorder, the first step in treatment would need to be professional help.

Are you letting go of bad habits that governed your life? Are you letting go of your eating disorder being a problem? Recovery isn’t just about eating properly and not caring what you look like. Recovery is loving yourself inside and outside. Recovery is deciding to not let what you put on your plate control your life. Recovery is knowing you deserve love and surrounding yourself with a positive environment. Recovery is letting go of the idea that you require others’ validation and permission to live life. Recovery is letting go of the old personality of insecurity, toxicity, self hate, and clothing yourself with love for who you are. 

What are you letting go of? Letting go can be a good thing if you are putting the old, bad habits away. If you are letting go of your eating disorder being a problem, you may be fooling yourself. If it isn’t a problem anymore, great!

I think recovery isn't a one-size-fits-all solution and certain tactics you try may end up in relapse and you just gotta accept that going in.

You never know you can trust yourself going in, part of recovery is learning to trust yourself.

Maybe they worked on some coping mechanisms that really helped them recovery and they might need to try enforce those mechanisms on this foreign exchange?

Self-care is super important. I made a list of self-care things I enjoy doing when I’m stressed and I would pick one out to distract me or calm me down if I was out of my comfort zone and away from those people who I’d often reach out to for help. Perhaps they can do something similar? 

I’m sure you’ve done this, but make sure they know they can always confide in you if they’re struggling to tell the parents and they should never be ashamed to be struggling - it’s completely normal and the most important thing is that she’s already reaching out to you for help.",htmlketi,1568876387.0,2019-09-19 01:59:47,"The fact is that , she's not someone I'm close with i just recently got into a relationship and she's my boyfriends best friend and im not that close with her because she's kinda distant and before we had time to get 'close' she left for exchange programme as well.

You said you will and you probably have already but definitely reach out but keep it simple? Just say that you understand she’s dealing with a lot and you will listen to her if she needs someone.

Then my brain tells me I’m being dramatic and I’m fine and don’t need all this anyway. It’s a weird space to be in.

I think it’s important to note that eating disorders have a mind of their own and are very competitive. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between your own voice and your eating disorders voice. It’s clear that some part of you truly wants to recover but your eating disorder got ramped up and has been super loud since you told your mom everything. It’s okay to not know if your ready. But it’s also worth noting that no one is ever ready. Your eating disorder has become a coping skill for you and a lot of times people will take on their eating disorder as a part of their identity. Having it stripped away is terrifying and almost like you are losing a part of yourself. Don’t forget as you take the next few steps that you are more than your eating disorder and that night of telling your mom is proof that some part of you wants recovery and wants your life back. I’m proud of you for even coming on here and asking for feedback because that takes a lot.

It required extra assistance from my dietician and also my family had to get involved. There was no reason for the relapse except stress (I had my wedding coming up).

305,d8c7ra,Toast_in_the_Toaster,1569336632.0,2019-09-24 09:50:32,"It is extremely important that you distance yourself from this individual for your recovery. The fact that you have a history with this girl that has essentially enabled your eating disorder in the past is going to become detrimental to your recovery. If you feel comfortable doing so, maybe you could talk to the other friend and explain your concerns regarding this girl. It sounds like, due to the friendship between the other two, that having this person not sit at the table is not a viable option. Perhaps, this friend could provide the extra support that you need when this other girl is around. 

Ultimately, you need to put your recovery first and if this girl being around you in any capacity is hindering your progress, then you need to remove yourself from that table and do what is best for you and explain that to your mutual friend. If there is another table or friend you could sit with, I'd strongly recommend doing that. 

Navigating relationships during recovery can be extremely difficult, but don't put yourself into toxic circumstances in favor of ""keeping the peace"". Surround yourself with positive influences. If the mutual friend can't understand and respect your needs, then you need to reevaluate that friendship. Part of recovery is removing the people in your life that kept you in the eating disorder. It sucks, but it's for the best in the long run. I've had to break off long term friendships and relationships because it was hurting my recovery and while it sucked at the time, it allowed me to come so much farther in my recovery. 

If simply more support at the table would help, then by all means. However, do not feel bad for leaving the table in favor of your physical and mental well-being. This recovery is yours, own it and do whatever you need to do to continue to move forward.

I follow a youtuber called ""Stefanie Buttermore"" who also lost her periods due to excessive exercise and restriction for Body Building contests. 
She recently changed her outlook and started going ""all in"", because (like you) she realised she was insatiably hungry no matter how much she ate. If I followed her correctly her plan is to keep eating what she wants until she fills the hunger and then to try body building again in a healthier way. I think this approach is good, because you can still keep some control over your intake.

Her chanel has helped me a lot, not only to feel less guilty but to see that the bodies we throw ourselves into starvation for arent always attainable.

Your pituitary will adjust the level of TSH it produces in response to the medication, so once you’ve been on it for a while, your test results will hopefully show a low-normal TSH level, which will just indicate that your pituitary is happy and not having to produce so much to get your thyroid working.

I couldn’t be with her as she was far too underweight for me to be in a healthy relationship. Even the brief relationship messed up my mental health for months (however I do believe this girl had an eating disorder unlike you). 

This might sound sad but I don’t think with the way your friend is acting your friendship will last... not until she decides that her health and happiness is more important than her weight and how she compares to others.

You are nowhere near at fault here and you don’t have to bend your eating habits to hers. You don’t need to go get your blood drawn, you don’t need to justify what you eat and if she doesn’t understand that then she isn’t considering your feelings in all this. Unfortunately, anorexia has a way of making people selfish (myself included in this). Relationships with friends and family incredibly suffer but ones the person actually dedicates themselves to recovery those relationships can be rekindled and sometimes come out stronger.

You need to talk with her and discuss why she’s focused on you and not herself. If she can’t be around you to recover, she should consider moving back in with her parents.

My girlfriend had me over to her parents house for dinner and her mom had an eating disorder and just watching the mom struggle triggered the fuck out of me. I almost had a relapse. I think supporting her really helps, and maybe suggest SMALL changes that’s she’s comfortable with but at the same time not boxing her into a corner (ie “you haven’t eaten a lot so maybe a granola bar would help if you were up to it” or “wow that fruit was really tasty did you want another one?”) the main reason I developed my eating disorder was because of lack of control. So make sure that you still give her some control (unless it’s some kind of emergency like being hospitalized or medical attention) while also prompting her to think about recovery. The main thing is just support her and do what’s going to be the best for her. Talk to her about recovery. Tell her what you really feel. Have her WANT recovery. There’s very little you can do if she doesn’t want to get better. So that would probably be your first step actually.

Notice I said first step, ED recovery is a long and difficult process of something akin to death and rebirth, leaving parts of yourself and cultivating new parts of yourself. The fact that she is confiding in you underlines the her confidence in you and her belief that she's safe enough with you to share that information, which is usually tightly held in people with eating disorders. Most eating disorders are about security, self-reliance, and isolation. So really she's stepping out of herself! This is a hard questions because everyone's needs are individual to why/how the ED developed in the first place, but being present, available, and aware is a huge contribution because she's obviously in a place in life where she is struggling. It's important to not feel alone because ED's thrive in the mind of the person they inhabit. You could recommend seeking treatment, you could reassure her that she has many qualities unrelated to appearance that you find valuable, you can't really ""take on"" an ED though- you really can't out maneuver it. You can demonstrate compassion and understanding and encourage her to continue the process. Fair warning, it may be very frustrating and the path is not uncommonly full or relapses and reversions, but that's how most addictions are...I hope you truly love this person, because it's not an easy illness, mentally, physically, emotionally.

I think it's quite beautiful that you are reaching out, and to add a footnote to my previous post as encouragement...people with ED are categorized as very sensitive and receptive individuals. There is a personality profile that overwhelmingly correlates to these individuals, and many of them are highly intelligent, perceptive, and giving. I believe you are with someone who is very special, maybe a bit guarded by the impact and blows life has dealt them. Relationships are about helping two people helping each other to divest of armors, defenses, and traumas- some conscious, other's deep and unexamined. In my opinion compassion and love that is balanced and reciprocal leads to healing. Men have the tendency to want to ""fix"" or ""correct"" problems, but there is another more subtle path towards recovery, and that's the easiest thing in the world, it's sensitivity and giving strength and hope when things seem bleak and mercilessly difficult.

I was at a deathly low weight, and the idea of putting on one single pound was like asking me to set myself on fire. The ""F"" word doesn't even properly convey how much I detested the idea. But deep down - in your heart - you know that there are so many reasons this ED is not for you. 

* It's not sustainable, death or worse, a state of permanent injury and incapacity, is probable.
* It will never stop. Even if you say ""Ok, I'm finally at X weight and this is officially the lowest I will go."" -- at some point, your weight might drop again if you get sick or go on a trip where you get a ton of exercise and don't eat the amounts you ""allow"" yourself to eat. Once your weight goes down again, you will never, ever regain it. And this repeats over time.  Why? because  in anorexia, there is no allowance of weight gain, even when you know you look like hell.
* your friends and family are worried. Very worried. Do you really want to be the person that burdens them? Even if you have zero friends or family...do you feel confident in public? If by some chance you are still at a relatively acceptable body weight, make no mistake that you will go down and get to the death-look soon, and random people will ask you if you need an MD ASAP.
* Do you want to keep doing this? The cycle of going in and out of treatment....same old stuff, lather, rinse repeat....Getting better means you can finally free up your mind and life.
* Do you think that you are only EITHER ""recovered fully"" or ""sick""? Because for most of us, it's a scale of recovery...at least for me. I know of few people that it doesn't still impact their lives, so no one is expecting you to be ""perfect"". That is ED telling you that, so that you won't try to make an attempt to actually recover. It wants you to be sick, so that you can be miserable and allow this illness to be the only force of life for you. It's not a life.
* Do you think that gaining weight is going to cause you to lose your identity?  I worried about this nonstop. It does not actually happen, and if I can say this, I promise you, you will be able to say it too. 

Here's a fact, too: your mind -- when deprived of the essential basic needs of food and water -- CANNOT think straight. Look at the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. Talk to people like me, who have been there. 

I've told this story before....but when I was at treatment in residential/acute, I met a woman who was there for Bulimia. She was not underweight, but did often purge to control her weight to a degree. While she was very deserving of treatment, I personally looked at her and thought ""she's definitely not underweight"" (nice thought, huh? Another great reason AN sucks!!) -- So, when we would eat meals and had to ""process"" afterward, we had to say one thing we liked about our bodies.  She would always say ""you know, I  like my body, a lot. I am happy with my stomach, etc..."".  And again, I thought ""I'm glad she is happy, I would be suicidal if I had that same body."" 

Fast forward literally 3 weeks. She was way advanced in the higher PHP house, and ready to check out soon. She saw me at the little bookstore, and even though we are not supposed to hug/talk to other people (lol!)  - we totally did. And allI could think was ""Damn, she looks amazing. She must be doing something to look that good..."".

Well: none of us are allowed to exercise, and weight - as a rule - was NOT ever allowed to decline. As in, if you even go down a little, they make certain your weight trends back up.  

So bottom line: in that 3 weeks, while I was eating and finally getting the nutrition I needed, my mind went from thinking ""She is kind of thick"" to ""dang, she is slim and gorgeous.""  AND SHE IS. My mind was that messed up.  It's all proof, just like the MN Starvation shows, that the mind is NOT accurate.  My point: if you have faith this time and really believe in the program, maybe you'll see the same changes happen in you.  

I still have days where I think I am large, but I feel so much better, and I have my laugh back, my love for others, my ability to be a real person again. Not some wisp of bones.  Wishing you the most AMAZING experience - all I can say is participate fully, be the leader that takes every group seriously, make it your ""job"" to make this your last time.  Make lots of friends -- you need each other!

If it bothers you, tell him. Have a conversation about it on how you interpret those kinds of comments. Don't shame him for saying that because he didn't know.

Understand that dealing with a loved one who has an eating disorder is really hard and it can be difficult to know the ""right"" things to say. Just be open and help him find the ways he can support you without commenting on your body in that way. It's been a long road figuring that out with my boyfriend and he's messed up plenty of times.

In my relationship we also had a bit of a talk around this, it took a long time of back and forth of talking about what that word means to us and how it's used in our relationship. For me it took explaining how I love her body, how she makes me absolutely crazy, how she carries her weight like a goddess and that I could build a shrine to her hips if I could. Now it's definitely used by both of us as a signifier of love, especially since she feels better and has started to love her body the way I do.

Sometimes I talk to myself in the third person, so instead of “I am a bad person,” I would then say, “Jane is a bad person.” But it feels awkward and bad to say that, and I never would treat anyone else the way I could treat myself. 

So it becomes almost a ritual to engage in this kind of compassion for myself that I have for others. It feels awkward and strange at first, but it becomes easier. I also try to reframe the things I like about myself and incorporate them. 

An example of this might go: “Jane is not a bad person. Jane is about much more that how her body looks or what is on the scale or what she eats and when. Jane teaches her friends how to sew. Jane is always there when her friends need her. Jane is learning to listen better so that she can be a better friend. Jane likes to think of practical gifts to give her friends. Jane is creative and enjoys making something beautiful with her hands. There is much more to Jane than the way her body looks. Jane tries hard to do her best and always looks for a lesson.”

Again—it will seem artificial at first. But do it anyway. Try and imagine a clone of yourself and what you would say to him/her, or talk to your younger self. It becomes far easier over time to fall into this habit. I find the third person trick (with my actual name) makes it easier because I feel so deeply uncomfortable saying nice things about myself.

1. Others have already said that by practice giving positivr thinking it can help you decrease your chances of spiraling down. (I cant offer much advice on this. I'd recommend creating another post to ask this very question). 

2. Food as a coping mechanism for traumas in your life. Id like to ask you if you have spoken about this outloud to people you trust. Would you be willing to go to therapy for this? I know it's scary, but I can't stress the fact that it will help. Do you have history of depression or other mental illness? 

3. I know it's very invalidating that your parents don't exactly see your habits as a problem.. yet... I think it's safe to assume that they don't necessarily Understand what you're going through mentally. You can bring it up one day, but for now you have to stay strong for yourself. You can do this by being a little more active and fight those urges to eat more than you need to. This is the hardest part! My psychiatrist suggested that when I recognize the urge I get up and distract myself from it - walk and or talk to people... You can again ask other people's thoughts and advice on this. 

4. When you have the urge to eat more than you have to... Try eating and snacking on fruits and vegetables. (this will also be a challenge, more on having access to this when you need it.

Tell your doctor when you see them next that you don't feel comfortable filling one out. Tell them you would like to be referred to a dietitian. Take charge of your recovery. You don't need to prove the severity of your eating habits by filling out a diary. Besides, diaries arent exactly reliable cuz you could easily lie on them if you wanted to. 

Fuck the food diary, if it's not going to help you then fuck it. There aren't ""requirements"" to be able to see a dietitian.

The dietician I found specialized in eating disorders and had a whole bunch of handouts which helped me tremendously. 

I did a food diary, but I did not count calories. She had me do a diary that made sure I was hitting enough fats, proteins and fiber in each meal. She geared it towards managing blood sugar spikes verses counting calories. She also gave me a sheet that had me list down my trigger foods (red-stop, don't eat), foods that can be trigger or can be okay depending on the situation (yellow), and foods that were completely safe that I never had problems with (green).  The goal was to move all the foods over to green over time.

I find that the less I eat and the longer I wait between meals, the harder it gets over time. The only way to reverse it is to eat as much as I can whenever possible. Sometimes I manage an actual meal and sometimes it’s just a small snack but each one is a form of success. 

For me, there doesn’t seem to be any magical method that can really encourage or enable me to eat more. Just do it. Force yourself. If you really feel you can’t eat anything, liquid food is the go-to. You can make shakes, juices, you can buy them, buy drinkable yogurt, kefir... whatever you like. 

Oh wait, the one thing that does help is exercise! I find my appetite increases after. Whether the gym or hiking or a long walk. But it’s possible to wait too long and let the appetite go away again, so if you feel yourself wanting food, make sure you eat then and there. 

But past that, I find that thinking about it too much makes it harder, so I just turn my thoughts off for a little and find some food and put it in my mouth.

My first recommendation is that you seek out professional help as soon as you can. Eating Disorders are usually the result of some deeper psychological issue. For me personally, it was years of trauma that I tried to fix with my eating disorder, kind of like a band-aid. Fyi it doesn't work. Secondly, try and make a conscious effort to not purge. Instead maybe try and think about why purging seems appealing at the moment. Journaling can help organize your thoughts. If you can't access treatment, find someone you can trust to talk to. Whether its a parent, a friend, a teacher, or guidance counselor, talking to someone about whats going on can be very beneficial. Eating disorders thrive in secrecy.

329,dls2lg,wigglytuffest,1571797544.0,2019-10-22 21:25:44,"Partners are confusing because they can be equally enabling and supportive. I had a similar situation with my partner where I was hyper focused on what they were eating. I would often feel embarrassed and intense shame if I ate more, or I would use them as a clock for when I should eat - if they weren’t hungry the ED in me was so happy because I could restrict with it being okay, and then on the flip side if they were wanting to binge I could shamelessly partake.

What’s helped for me is rigorous meal planning. My therapist talks about food being medicine for eating disorders. This takes the form of planning 3 meals of proper sizes, 2-3 snacks a day, all eaten at regular intervals of no longer than 4 hours apart. This planning I found gave me the same permission that I found when I tried eating around my boyfriends body cues. Also, viewing the prepped meals as medicine makes me less obsessed with what he’s eating, because he doesn’t need medicine in the regular intervals as I do.

Also, having the meals prepped is easy and thoughtless. I don’t have to worry about measuring portions in comparison to my partner. 

I still struggle and relapse but having my meals prepped for easy access, and viewing them as medicine helps me a lot. As well helps my relationship with my partner, and food.",nooorecess,1571816786.0,2019-10-23 02:46:26,"ah god i'm in the exact same boat. this is one of the toughest parts of the ED for me, especially because i'm prone to becoming irritable and snappy toward people when i'm hungry or feeling food-related anxiety, and i can't help feeling resentful sometimes when my bf or whoever i'm with eats less than me (which either makes me feel guilt for eating more, or cheated of getting enough food because i think i need to stop eating when they do.)

i know this comes from the ED behaviours being so normalized in my own brain that i falsely attribute them to other people's actions - it's hard to believe anyone's ever ""not hungry"" or feeling sick etc; i just automatically assume they are purposely trying to eat less than me as an act of hostility when really they are just doing what's normal for them and have no idea what's going on in my anxious mind lol.

anyway wigglytuffest is right, the meal plan enforcement is what i've been doing and it does take practice but i can tell it's getting better. it also helps that i'm lucky enough to have a supportive partner who is in the loop with my treatment plan so he doesn't question when i pull out snacks at odd hours or whatever. if you feel comfortable discussing this stuff with your boyfriend i highly recommend just getting it all out in the open. i find just talking and joking casually about my weird ""prescribed snacking"" makes it not feel so weird or shameful. so much of eating disorder behaviours thrive in secrecy so i'm finding the more i can just be honest about it, the less power it has over me",scouttheog,1571861251.0,2019-10-23 15:07:31,"I agree with the other comments that a meal plan can be helpful in the beginning, but over time you shouldn't need it. It can become your new safe thing: It's okay to eat, but ONLY if it's at the approved time, or the approved amount, etc. At that point it's holding you back. So watch out for that as you progress. The food obsession will go away naturally as your body is no longer in calorie deficit, so if you focus on your own nutrition for a while (very difficult, I know) it will become easier and easier to ignore your boyfriends food habits",paradoxicalconundrum,1571875160.0,2019-10-23 18:59:20,"I think the meal plan idea is a good technical solution, but from the emotional perspective I think you should try to put your mind towards your own normalities (being the way you process food/when you eat/your relationship with food) and try to remind yourself that his normalities and bodily functions are probably very different. We are all very different in the way we consume foods and the way we feel, so it’s only natural that your partner may have different eating patterns and feelings about food than you do. It’s difficult dealing with a bad relationship with food, and it’s easy to feel isolated around and envious of people who don’t really have to worry about that. If you feel like he would be receptive to a conversation about it then I’d say go for it so you’re being open with him, maybe just let him know you really don’t want him to feel guilty and things of that nature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s great that you are following up with your medical appointments. If you have pre-existing conditions, particularly cardiac, both losing a lot of weight and being underweight could add to the cardiac strain. Because you don’t yet know the reason, it’ll be hard for the doctor to investigate what is causing what, but both the weight loss and being underweight can cause those issues. I believe (I’m not a doctor) that if you continue to lose more weight (I would guess by eating less and exercising too much), things could escalate fast, I hope you’ll be completely honest with your doctor about your issues...",lolaecho,1572267699.0,2019-10-28 08:01:39,"You need to be candid with your doctor about the cause of your weight loss and your ED. You say you have not been diagnosed with an eating disorder, maybe it's time you change that to at least gain a support system. One of the biggest issues I had with my ED was my resting heart rate dropped down to about 40 like yours, this was why I was so urgently pushed into recovery. Despite your other health conditions, your ED is almost definitely affecting your heart rate. Please try to talk to your doctor about this, maybe he can refer you to a psychologist?  

If you are not taking in enough calories/protein, weight lifting will only strain what little muscle you have left. Your heart is a muscle, and it will be losing mass as the rest of your body is losing mass. This is extremely dangerous as you can imagine. A smaller and weaker heart will have a much harder time pumping blood (hence the decreasing heart rate), and intense exercise can push your heart too hard and in worse case scenario to the point of failure/heart attack.

PLEASE GET HELP! What you are doing is so dangerous, especially with your pre-existing condition. I know it's so hard and the idea of stopping your behaviour seems like the worst thing in the world, I've been there. But it needs to be done, and it's so worth it. I took a break from working out for a little while to help my recovery and due to the dangers of working out with a weak heart, but now since I can exercise again I've noticed a huge change. I genuinely enjoy it for the workout rather than for the calories burnt and I have so much more energy to use. 

I hope everything goes well for you and you get the help you deserve. Nobody deserves to feel this way about their body and feel so controlled by food.

This also encourages her to make sure she eats when she says she doesn't want to, especially when I say ""hey, I'm going to make some dinner. I'll make some extra for you too!"" and she almost always ends up eating too.

I also NEVER comment on what she likes. I try as much as possible to normalize food, bodies, exercise, etc. So I never ever ever say ""man I ate so much of that cake, I better go to the gym."" I try my best to normalize exercise (we are both personal trainers too).

The best thing is for her to feel like she can go to you whenever she feels she wants to. Don't tell her she has to do this or that (""you gotta eat this"") etc. If you bring it up too often it might make her feel like that's all you focus on (her ED) when you see her. 

she probably has other people in her life like parents telling her when to eat so you don't have to be that person. You don't wanna be controlling. 
I'm sure you won't do that anyway! You sound like a really good guy trying to understand better to help her. 

Just love her and remind her you care. You aren't responsible for her health and nothing her ED tells her to do will ever be your fault so just remember that.

When she's feeling bad, use open questions like ""is there anything I can get you?/ Do you need anything right now?""

Also when she does well like she eats despite being afraid, I wouldn't make a big deal out of it. 
Sometimes when someone says ""I'm proud of you"" , she might not feel like she's done a good thing by eating so she might not like that. It's to do with her ED and rational mind battling. She knows rationally it's good but her ED is giving her crap for it.

I'm not a professional or anything though. You definitely know her best, so I would say just be understanding and make her feel cared for and loved.

The binges are most likely caused by the restriction the rest of the time. You're starving, so when you eat you over-eat, then feel bad because you're not restricting, so you try again, over and over. Also, recovery often means binging a lot because your body has been suppressed for a while. It wants extra just in case you go back into starving mode. That's not BED either. That's your body trying to make up for all the lost calories from before. Most people recovering from anorexia or other restricting disorders find out that after they binge for a while, their body calms down because it realizes you're not going to starve any more, and you end up at normal amounts of food again.


Basically, it's normal to binge after a long time restricting because the starving is so forced and unnatural for your body",Akka1805,1572127396.0,2019-10-26 17:03:16,"It definitely sounds like you have an eating disorder but not binge-eating disorder as someone else said.

My thoughts of food would consume me to the point I can’t focus on anything else. And when I do eat (with some restriction) I feel insatiable. Like I want to eat more, I’m so so so hungry. But I don’t because I hate the feeling of guilt afterwards.

But then there are days after a long period of restricting, I’d lose my self control and go all out and gorge on food even when I’m not hungry, I’d just binge on food non-stop like a deprived woman (which is basically true anyway).

Body size is a variable issue. There is no ubiquitous ideal body size, it depends on a lot of factors. But, there is an interesting study of BMIs that shows that people who are ""overweight"" according to the bmi tend to actually have longer lives and have better health outcomes than people in the ""healthy normal"" range. 

""What?"" You might ask ""why is the healthy range actually less healthy?"".

On closer analysis, it's because people on the low end of the normal BMI die more when health complications arise. So, I would argue, that the range for a healthy BMI needs to be either moved up a little, or just raise the bottom of the healthy range to 19 BMI or higher as the lowest reliably healthy weight.

I was also thinking, that we should add official ranges for ""conditionally healthy"" bmi weights. Like for weightlifters, or people who are just always on the skinny side no matter what they eat. Where doctors use other health markers to determine health, rather than just looking at weight.

Personally, I found the most success in my recovery when I stopped focusing on how to love, or even like my body, and instead just stopped paying much attention to the way I looked at all.

I do not believe that you have an eating disorder due to the way you have described your mental state. However, this habit of not eating due to fear of throwing up or feeling sick could lead to an eating disorder. 

I do recommend though to maybe eat small portions throughout the day, in order to reduce this feeling of nausea. So maybe eat something very small every 1/2 hours of the day. They recommend this eating pattern for people who have G.E.R.D/G.O.R.D (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease), in which I have. As it greatly reduces the feeling of nausea.",dinghyskip,1572998983.0,2019-11-05 18:09:43,"While what you are describing does not sound like a typical eating disorder, with symptoms being more focused on your physical state rather than mental/emotional, the change in your behaviors and attitude around food can become a slippery slope. It is good that you are mindful of this possibility and you seem concerned for your ability to retain a ‘normal’ relationship with food.
If this is new (and evening if it is not, really) you may want to consult your primary care doctor as this sounds more like a GI upset, which can be either chronic or acute. 
If you already know of any food sensitivities you may have, it is best to avoid these foods as much as possible. Even if they have only caused minor discomfort in the past, if they are working in concert with other inflammation the food sensitivities may be hitting you harder than they have before.
Have you tried taking a daily antacid? Omeprazole (under many brand names, one being Prilosec) is a typical first-line PPO that is considered very safe and effective. Try taking one daily for about 2 weeks, see if your symptoms improve. You may also/or try a calcium bicarbonate tablet (like TUMS) with a meal, especially if you notice there are certain trigger foods for your symptoms. 
Have you started any new medications since before you began noticing these symptoms? Or, have you taken an antibiotic within recent months or before noticing these symptoms? Medications can effect appetite, gut motility, microbiome, and/or stomach ph, which can all affect how we feel after meals. Especially in the case of antibiotics, a very high count (at least 1billion colony forming units, CFU) probiotic may be beneficial. Look for one that contains some or all of these strains: Lactobacillus (especially helpful for those with some lactose sensitivity), Bifidobacterium, or Saccharomyces boulardii. A probiotic takes some time until you will feel results, usually around a month of daily doses; the bacteria need time to colonize and populate within your intestines and also out-compete any yeasts or non-beneficial bacteria currently colonizing your gut. 
Our appetite and general gut function is also somewhat regulated by stress. Have you had any major life changes (even positive changes!) or additional stress lately? If so, the above over the counter remedies may be of benefit, as well as some stress mitigation or mindfulness techniques like meditation. 
I understand that discomfort and gassiness can be awkward or embarrassing to deal with in public, and that can create a lot of stress and anxiety around food/eating. Treating these symptoms with decreased food intake will only mask the discomfort for a short period of time and may eventually worsen the under-lying issue or make treating the issue harder/more lengthy. It sounds like you are concerned about how this has affected your intake and ability to eat food comfortably (both physically and psychologically), it would be good to try to address the physical discomfort you are feeling now. 
I know GI upsets can be incredibly frustrating and can feel like they affect your entire life, try to stick to a plan and stay positive. Unfortunately these things don’t always resolve themselves very quickly, but with some help they can certainly be managed or even resolved with changes that work for you. It may take some ‘Guess and Test’, hang in there.

About 20 years ago, my ED was more serious, more so mentally in my mind than physically and now it’s more physical than mental.

You can try eating at maintenance for a while to see if that reduces or stops the binges.
If it does and you want to restrict again only reduce your calories by a very small amount and don't ever eat under your bmr.

It's possible that the counting in itself leads to disordered eating and in that case you have to stop doing it and try other things like intuitive eating.

The best option would be to get professional help that is specialized in eating disorders.

When I first started into my eating disorder I didn’t count calories but I was super conscious of them. I didn’t even download or start weighing my food until I was like 1-2 years into my ED. I do think it can cause you to become very rigid around food and can trigger an ED.

So I started intermittent fasting and calorie counting to try and lose the extra 10lbs or so that I had, but I still got to eat all the food I liked, just less of it, yay! 

This went on for a few months and as the weight came off the calories got lower because I was seeing results and I wanted more of that. I was getting more attention from my partner, my friends were commenting on my appearance positively and I felt lighter. 

I'm at the point now where I can't stomach more than 1000 calories a day, and I average at around 800-900. I'm losing muscle mass so I'm replacing the foods with more protein rich stuff to try and combat it, but I cannot stop my head from calculating all the calories I put in, and once it gets to that 1000 mark I start to feel extremely anxious about it. I went for a birthday meal with a friend and almost panicked when I saw that every meal on the menu was over 1000 calories. 

I don't think I have a disorder as such, because I don't think I have problems anywhere near as bad as others do, so I wouldn't want to compare. But starting to count them has definitely made me look at food differently, and made me enjoy eating it a lot less.

You can continue being a source of comfort and love for her while helping her find a therapist, psychiatrist, and physician.

It can be very easy to get sucked into the codependent/enabling role with our loved ones, where we think we are helping and keeping people alive when really we are just enabling their disorder.   


And if you don't like the first therapist you meet with, that's okay! See another one. Sometimes it takes a few tries to find a good fit, so don't get discouraged.

What a few other people said as well. And just trying to normalize food or whatever. 

  My partner also has some issues with eating (it presents itself differently to my ED though)  and since I’ve gone to my own therapy for it, I’ve also noticed an improvement in him too. For example, I buy and keep snacks in the house now. I never used to, but I just buy those little cereal bars and take one with me to work incase I get hungry and need a snack. But when we are traveling together I always pack extras just incase he wants one too. I’ve noticed that before he would never accept random foods but since he’s seen me eat them all the time, he now eats them too. Or we share snacks together so he doesn’t have to eat a whole one. Today I saw him grab a cereal bar from the shelf for himself!! I think it’s just because we have them in the house and I’ve kind of normalized eating snacks. But it wasn’t my intention, it’s just happened like that :)

For sure get a dietitian to help you in your recovery!",VTMongoose,1572611024.0,2019-11-01 07:23:44,"Just so we're clear, the exercise addiction didn't cause the extreme hunger. The consistent calorie restriction from the anorexia did. You can keep exercising if you want, it's just going to make you feel a lot more hungry and prolong the process. Cardio exercise always makes me hungry, even ""post recovery"". Recovery is a long process, by the way. It took me about a year to feel completely physically and mentally ""normal"" post-recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

My advice would be to shift your exercise focus. Your goal right now is to stop feeling hungry and start living normally again. Your main goals have nothing to do with exercise. It doesn't mean you should completely stop - exercise is a healthy habit you want to keep. So stop doing cardio other than maybe 1-2 sessions a week just to maintain your fitness level. Keep doing weight lifting. Weight lifting burns almost no calories but it makes you stronger and it makes you feel better. It diverts calories that would be used to build fat towards building muscle.

&amp;#x200B;

You're going to have some degree of fat rebound, but this will go away on its own in time. Your hunger will stop at some point, guaranteed. You might need to gain 30 pounds of fat, but trust me, eventually everyone hits that point where their hunger just turns off. You'll never go back to obesity unless you go back to the habits that got you into an obese state in the first place, whether it be binge eating, eating the Standard American Diet (fast food or other junk food), whatever. Eat as many whole, healthy foods as you want. You'll never ""get fat"" eating chicken, potatoes, vegetables, fruit, etc. Sure, you'll gain a relatively small amount of fat in the short term. That's exactly what the goal is - that's literally how you stop the extreme hunger.

&amp;#x200B;

Without throwing out numbers, I was a certain weight when I was obese, which ***I spent half my lifetime at,*** and I starved myself to 50% of that. I rebounded to 55.7% of my max weight about 1.5 years ago. Even eating as much as I possibly could recently (trying - and succeeding - at setting some PR's in my cycling hobby), I was only able to reach 58.5% of my maximum obese weight and my strength and energy levels were off the charts. I didn't really have much of a desire to eat more at that point. Didn't eat 100% clean, either. I would still eat out occasionally, drink beer, have a pizza, whatever. Since then been tightening up a bit, eating more protein, and I've drifted down to 56.5% of my max without even trying really. History tells me once I get much lower than about 54%, I start to feel hungry all the time, my workout quality drops and I lose fitness. So even in a former morbidly obese person, yes, the body's ""internal regulatory stuff"" works **perfectly** post-weight loss because I habitually eat whole foods and exercise now, whereas when I was obese I habitually ate high-calorie foods for pleasure and sat and played video games all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

All the times during my extreme hunger rebound, the eating disorder told me I was uniquely broken in some way and that I was going to binge my way back to being obese. It was a lie. I'm just like everyone else. Watch Stephanie Buttermore's ""All In"" videos for more real-world education on this process.",stephiemckk,1572618490.0,2019-11-01 09:28:10,"Well, feels like I wrote this myself. haha So my parents are health NUTS so I started having personal trainers and nutritionist since i was 12 years old... That can't mess up a 12 year old girl right??? \*eye roll\*

My whole life I have gone through high weight and extremely low weight. 4 years ago I was in the best shape of my life. But I was INSANELY unhealthy. I was working out 2-3x a day. 4am, lunch, 8pm. And rarely eating. Basically eating eggs and vegetables. But not enough to sustain me at all. I looked fabulous and felt like complete shit. I might mention I was single at the time as well because I thought that was the only way I was going to find someone to want me. But I was killing myself and so obsessed with my routine that I was in bed by 8pm everynight and didn't do anything social. I even gave up an internship I REALLY wanted because it cut into my routine. 

I then met my husband and he loved me for me and I found so much worth in that, got in a life altering car accident. And have been on so many medications that i have gained weight. Not a ton but enough to notice. For the past year I have been going to therapy to deal with my disorders because I fell into a deep depression because I wasn't allowed to work out due to my recovery and so instead I was just not eating. Or I was binging and then hating myself. 

I am finally in a place where I can be moderate with my exercise to be healthy, and I eat to fuel my body, and sometimes indulge. I really think a lot of it was with the help of therapy realizing how mean I am to myself when I give everyone else around me allowance to be themselves and not be perfect. I hold myself to an impossible standard which sounds like you do as well. I also found a love for cooking, making food and feeding other people which in turn helps me enjoy food but also me mindful of what I am eating. I also have learned that when I am in the binge hunger feeling I have a HUGE laundry list of healthy low calorie snacks. 

One other thing I did is took my work outs outside the gym. Hiking, biking, yoga classes or any group classes, just night time walks with my dog and husband. To make it more of a positive experience working out then killing myself in a gym. I still go to the gym occasionally. But making it more of a making memories experience helped it be a more positive experience for me.

^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Feedback ^^appreciated.",Kommandant45,1572622125.0,2019-11-01 10:28:45,"1. Yes, it does go away. When I was in recovery I had to increase how much food I was eating. I was horribly underweight despite my vigorous regime when I started recovering, and honestly I was more hungry then and chose to ignore my body. As I started to eat more food more consistently, the intense hunger subsided. It took time for sure (4 months or so), but it did get better. Granted, I was still cycling, but as I gained weight, I actually got way stronger and faster. I didn't even know how much my low weight was holding me back.
2. I'm extremely goal-oriented, and I leveraged that with the help of my therapist to focus my athletic efforts into something productive. Part of what got me to the point of anorexia was extreme adherence to my extremely low-calorie diet and drive to perform. I turned the narrative around and started saying, 'you can only get faster if you eat more so you can build more muscle and fitness'. I wasn't going to get better if I didn't gain weight and change my perspective on food.
3. A lot of people will tell you that you have to give up exercise in recovery. Unless you're dangerously underweight or absolutely can't stop exercising for any reason like injury or sickness, you shouldn't have to back off completely. Of course, please consult a doctor or therapist on this – I'm just some guy on reddit, so if your therapist tells you to stop, then do it.
   1. Developing a healthy relationship with everything is key though. For me, proper nutrition and nourishment is equally, if not more important than the miles I put in. Eating enough is as much a goal for me as a PR on a segment is. Making into a goal like that was critical for me. Sure, sometimes I still get stuck on eating that cookie if I didn't 'earn' it, but more often than not, lizard brain doesn't win and that cookie becomes a part of my positive goal and my own normal relationship with food.",Bomby57,1572634134.0,2019-11-01 13:48:54,"Eating more regularly will help. When sugar levels in the blood drop, you will crave more and more. My therapist told me to avoid spacing food more than 4 hours. Each meal needs carbs too. You shouldn't restrict on food you crave but you need to portion control to make you don't overeat. 2 chocolate pieces is better than zero when you're recovering. But 2 chocolate pieces is also better than 10 as you're learning to eat normally.

Have you tried meditation and/or yoga to replace some of the time spent in your exercise session? Most yoga sessions or relaxation sessions will be 10 to 15 minutes if you do them daily, and that will be some time you can take to reflect on how your body feels, what you really want to become, etc.

Your metabolism will take a while to adjust to the new less exercise amount. ED plus exercise can cause a hypermetabolic state as well. Hunger is a signal to EAT, it’s hard but listen.

Try to be an example of of what eating meals and snacks looks like.  Try to incorporate a variety of food types.  For example, don’t avoid foods that are commonly seen as “unhealthy.”  

Just listen and don’t try to fix her or her problems.  Stop giving advice, even though you mean well.

She is the only one who can decide she has had enough of living like this.  She is the only one who can decide to get better.  Just be there.  Listen without judgement.  Be a good example of what a healthy attitude on food and exercise looks like.  Offer to drive her or go with her to any appointments, and wait for her in the waiting room.

I decided for myself that I need to be careful about this kind of thing.

358,dukp0a,Query8897,1573438100.0,2019-11-10 20:08:20,"I have the story of my mother, diagnosed with early-onset osteopenia at age 35, which was disconcertingly early for her doctors - you're 14 years younger. I will share it because hey, it may help some people be aware of what bone density issues can do to you. She lives with it and takes calcium pills, took good care of herself for the most part, and was careful with her body. She is 66 now and has a heavily deformed back; it didn't become deformed in her old age though. By when she was 40, she had a deep groove going along her back due to lordosis, the deformation of the spine where it bends inward. It looks mildly horrifying. This was just around 6 years after her diagnosis, keep in mind. She's also tilted to one side due to scoliosis, the deformation of the spine where it tilts to one side, off-center. As she's aged, she's also developed spondylosis, caused by wear to her spine. 

All of these conditions are made easier to get when your bones are soft, as with osteopenia. The bones become easy to deform, and even slight bad postures can and will cause deformities more severe than in a healthy person. All of these conditions come with pain and decreased mobility, as well as aesthetic downsides. If you're concerned about your body looking thin and good, well, lordosis can give your back a groove so deep you can fit a glass in it, that doesn't look good. Scoliosis makes you look like you have a huge fat roll on one side, because the spine tilting to one side makes that side compress. No matter how thin you are, that fake fat roll will be there. You can also get kyphosis, or a back hump, much more easily.

Keep in mind any back postures you've carried these 20 years will affect this. Do you hunch over on the computer or chairs? You're a likely candidate for early forms of lordosis and kyphosis. You're so young, you might develop a hump within the next 10-15 years with how bad your bones are!

My mother's spinal conditions meant she fractured a spinal disc- easy to happen with cases of early onset osteopenia and osteoporosis, combined with all the spinal deformities. The pain was indescribable. My mother's the kindest, warmest, sweetest person I knew, and for the first 10 years after her spinal disc fracture and hernia, she became an angry mess, with constant mood-swings, unable to do half the things she did throughout her youth, unable to take full care of herself, unable to cook, to work, to do her hobbies. The pain never went away, but she's learned to manage it better.

Her neck is also causing her great and constant back pain, as the spondylosis causes her spine to painfully compress. She is NOT alright. And this is JUST the things her osteopenia has influenced, she's taken such good care not to fall into osteoporosis. If you don't take care of yourself, this is a possible future.

**HOWEVER**, I don't think scaring you with stories about osteopenia is the way to go about your ED. Have you had therapy? You need to treat, I'm sure you know, the underlying reasons for your ED, not try to scare yourself with possible conditions. If you have depression, this isn't going to help. If you have anxiety, it probably won't help either. If it's body image issues, the idea of being thin will probably trump other kinds of body issues because of its place in society. I've had issues with my mental health and disordered eating, and taking care of the underlying reasons for this is the best way to move forward. I think if you aren't already, you should go to a therapist that specializes in EDs. If you are, maybe you and your therapist aren't compatible and you need to find a new one to make progress. Whatever it is, I hope dearly that you're able to move past it, and that you can have a healthy relationship with food and your weight.

Your post is the perfect description of my teen years. So first thing I want to say to you is that you are NOT alone in this. 

I've been struggling like forever both with my body shape and my weight. I used to think and feel the lesser I weigh, the better I was. So wrong, I know it now. 
I've always been overweight and I was so uncomfortable with that, so I diet. I did a lot of diets. I've been on VERY restrictive diets so many times and every time I ended up eating max one yogurt per day and that yogurt always felt bad to me. I still remember the fights with my parents who wanted me to eat and somehow forced me to eat, no matter if my eyes were filled with tears because I felt like eating was such a horrible and unnatural thing to do. I understand you feel more or less the same when you're in your anorexic time. 
During these terrible diets I used to lose like 20/25 kg. But I ate nothing. Yet I was so comfortable with that. Like you, I liked myself better when I was in the anorexic times. My self-confidence and self-esteem depended on my weight. I would feel so bad and guilty and such an horrible person if I gained even 1 kg. 
But then, after every restrictive diet I have ever done, well, then there was the binging time. I used to eat everything, no matter the weight. During this period, I used to gain every single kg I had lost until I found myself in an overweight shape AGAIN. So I diet AGAIN. And this fucked up circle repeated itself until I was 20, when my eating disorder exploded.

This whole story to tell you that breaking this mad circle is the most difficult thing to do. Recovering from my ED was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. Even now the thought of all that pain hurts. 
My suggestion is to seek professional help. EDs are never about food really: the complicated relationships with food and body shape are just the results to an inner struggling. You can't fight this on your own. It's not like you need to fix some broken thing and these kind of thoughts and behavior you have and I had are hard to fix. 

I would really like to say to you that these feelings will go away on their own eventually, that this is just a phase. But it's not. In my experience behaviors like those you descripted in your posts lead me to a fucking, serious desease.  
Please, don't do the same because you and your weight are two very different things. 

You may try school counseling if you're a student or go see a therapist specialized in ED.

I say ‘it’ as in the thoughts we have when we are active in our ED behaviors. Our ED behaviors are completely reactionary to our environment and thought processes.

When I had an ED it was the heaviest I had ever been. I cured it and have now been a healthy weight I love for 3 years. I also am in the medical field so have a science background and decent understanding of biology and weight. Here are the steps I took: 

1. I decided to give up fad diets / starving myself completely. I knew the healthy way to lose weight was to eat healthy and exercise, but that seemed like it was going to take too long so I kept starving myself when I felt fat. Well after years of failing to lose weight and keep it off, I figured the healthy way was better than nothing. 

2. Starting October 2016, I ate when I was hungry. This is the scary part, but I truly believe over 90% of weight issues are mind issues (whether that be anxiety, depression, stress). I took this time to focus on healing my mind. I ate when I was hungry, and at times that meant eating half a jar (or more) of peanut butter in one sitting. Biologically when your body has been starved you crave calorie dense foods. This phase of overeating most days lasted for 3-4 months for me. And the scary part comes in because I did gain weight. But did I lose any friends? No. Did I lose my job? No. Was my life any worse in any way? No. I actually felt awesome because the temptation to binge slowly went down. Don’t take this time to let yourself eat till you’re sick, but eat until you are satisfied and feel ok with it, even if it seems like a lot. 

3. January 2017, I started a weight lifting and meal prep regime with no calorie counting. I would lift (starting slow but increasing weight each week)  3-4 times per week. And meal prep on Sundays for the week. It actually saved me so much time and money. For meal preps I would make whatever I was craving but made sure to use mostly whole foods with a good blend of carbs, protein, and fat. I never ever counted calories since my ED. But (and this part is huge) if I ended up binging one weekend, I let myself do it and didn’t feel bad about it. But for that upcoming week I would add more carbs (usually rice) and fat (either fattier meat or avocado) to my meals because clearly I wasn’t getting enough which is why I binged on crap. I didn’t weigh myself either. But after doing this for 6 months, I learned from doctors visits that I had lost 25 pounds. And the weight I was after weight lifting (125 pounds at the time and I’m 5’6) looked so much better on me than when I was 125 and starving myself because it was mostly muscle so my stomach was totally flat. 125 with an ED I had a belly. 125 with weights I had a butt and no belly. The scale really doesn’t matter. 

4. Every time I looked in the mirror, I reminded myself instead of hating on my body to thank my body. Whenever I would start to think my legs look fat, I would think instead “thank you legs for carrying me everyday” Or for my stomach “thank you core for giving me strength and stability for everything I do”. I know it sounds stupid but it really worked.

Now I have less time to work out because of my crazy schedule, but I have gotten good at intuitive eating so my weight stays healthily low (lower than 125 pounds since I lost muscle... which is sad but shows this way has worked to keep the weight off). I never made any food off limits. And I can’t even remember the last time I binged... it’s been years which I never ever thought would be possible. You’re body doesn’t want to be overweight, so if you treat it right and give it what it needs, it will treat you right back.

I’m sorry this was so long but hopefully it can help!",oliviared52,1574400624.0,2019-11-21 23:30:24,Hey my name’s Olivia!

I did want to comment just to say: if you had an ED in the past, you need to be incredibly careful with losing weight. Please talk to a registered dietician about setting up a meal plan with you/have them monitor your exercise. Remember, there is no fast way to lose weight that is safe/permanent. Large amounts of weight loss over a shirt period of time leads to gaining it all back (and maybe then some). There is no quick fix. Please talk to an RD and a therapist about your specific issues with your family, as it seems like there’s a lot more there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

368,dykzzt,T_86,1574181442.0,2019-11-19 10:37:22,"33f here who has struggled with eating disorders my entire life. I’ve either gone months to years binge eating and gaining weight or extreme restriction of calories and high workouts to become underweight (most my life it’s been that one). On top of binge eating and anorexia, I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 12. Although anorexia is a huge struggle occupying my anxiety, it’s a struggle I can hide. Bipolar, however, does not have that luxury. I’m also a bit of a perfectionist and control freak so I’ve worked extremely hard at learning to best handle my bipolar disorder. 

Long story short, when people come into my personal life that I feel are going to stay, there know I need to tell them about my bipolar disorder. That’s become easier for me. My bf who I’ve lived with for 3 years is very supportive and one basic rule we use to keep our relationship work despite my mental illness is to never lie about anything, big or small. We try to work as a team and help shoulder each other’s burdens so being completely open and honest is crucial to that. 

I’ve been struggling hard with anorexia the past 13 months. I didn’t lie to my bf but I just didn’t tell him for quite awhile. If he asked questions like if I ate that day, I told him the truth but I didn’t fully open up about the actual struggle I’m going through till a couple of months ago. 

I think it’s really important to fully explain the struggle for others to understand. We can’t expect them to understand at all what it’s like when they haven’t been through it or seen it other than how the media poorly/wrongly displays it. You need to sit down and tell him the exact thoughts you have, as terrible as they might be. Let him see you cry or shake over it, fully make him aware so he can better understand that this is not something to take lightly, that an anxiety pill won’t make it go away or that simply thinking happy thoughts will help. Maybe even read books that you can relate to and lend them to him so he can see that it’s a real disorder, or watch YouTube videos on it with him. He can’t know it’s not just a “sad feeling” and that it’s an actual illness as real as cancer or diabetes unless you educate him. 


So sorry for that long post. I hope you read it and got something from it. Educating ppl in my life is the ONLY way I’ve ever got them to understand my mental illnesses are as real as any other illness. Nothing else has ever worked for me.",notgivingupmyshot,1574181831.0,2019-11-19 10:43:51,"You have been with him for a while so it seems like you trust him. He also seems to not understand mental health body issues. Maybe you could start by explaining some of that to him, like the stigma and what not. And led into your own story. 

You can tell him however you want, like if writting helps you, write him a letter and give it to him. 

Also think about if telling him before Thanksgiving will put to much pressure on you or if it will help you cope with the day.
Good luck, you got this",singingtangerine,1574186911.0,2019-11-19 12:08:31,"Honestly, as for the Thanksgiving thing, I feel like it might be dropping a lot on him all of a sudden to explain all your eating issues. He may not get it at all - with things like this it’s better to introduce it a little bit at a time. You may just want to tell him you want to spend the holiday with family - it isn’t a lie, plenty of people do it. I certainly wouldn’t skip thanksgiving with my family to spend it with my boyfriend’s.

At some point, though, it’s a good idea to tell him. Maybe start with “sometimes I have trouble eating enough,” or something similar, and explain when/if he asks questions. You don’t have to tell him all at once that you struggled with a horrible mental illness for 10+ years. If he doesn’t get it, it may overwhelm him.

Personally, I went a totally different route and began with “lol I used to starve myself” on the second date. I don’t think I’ve ever talked about my eating disorder in a non-joking way, but that’s what I do to cope, and my boyfriend gets it. He’s been incredibly understanding about it all, occasionally even asks me what I’ve had to eat that day because he still worries.",bononobonbon,1574198937.0,2019-11-19 15:28:57,I like the joking approach.

Recovery is a long, slow battle fought day after day after day, so it’s pretty essential that the person be invested in the pursuit.


I think you could express your concern for how this is affecting her and how it is affecting the whole family. It’s often hard for us to even perceive how we’re hurting ourselves, much less understand that our struggle is rippling outward and causing pain to those who love us. Using “I” statements, listening, and expressing care, are important I think. It can be kinda challenging to find a healthy balance point: not enabling, not being co-dependent, honestly expressing your feelings and needs, and still coming from a place of empathy and support for her.


It’s very hard to save someone who does not want to be saved. For awhile I was that person, and it was heart-wrenching for everybody involved.

A couple of years back, I was diagnosed with CFS, Flu, an unknown flu-like illness, Bell’s Palsy, and something else that I’ve forgotten the name of. This lead to me being stuck at home for 6 months, practically bedridden for most of it. But during this period, I ate very little. Like, for the first 4 months, I was lucky to eat more than half a sandwich for the entire day. I wasn’t really hungry, and I felt too sick and tired to eat. I started eating more for the last couple, but I never caught up to my normal amount.

After it ended though, and I recovered mostly, I had the same problem as you. I’ve always been someone who was hungrier than most, even as a baby, but this was ridiculous! Just like you said, I had to eat so much to feel full (1,500+ calories per meal) that I’d feel sick, and then I’d feel hungry again really quickly. Generally, I couldn’t eat enough to feel full most of the time simply because I couldn’t eat anymore without literally throwing up, or much more likely because my family wouldn’t let me.

For me, although I wanted to eat more, I live with my family and back then my mum insisted on doing all my cooking for me despite being nearly an adult, and that meant that I couldn’t eat much more than normal because of her. I ate a lot more snacks and started eating 4 meals a day for a while, 3 during the day and one at night when everyone else was asleep since my sleep schedule was still wrecked.

Eventually, it just went away. No clue why. It was horrible when I had it, but I couldn’t eat enough to make myself full most of the time.

I expect I probably triggered it because I ate so little during those 6 months. I lost a huge amount of my weight, it was the lowest I’d been in years, but as soon as it ended I just kept gaining it at such an extreme rate that I ended up as fat as I am now. I’m not sure if that’s just because my metabolism got lowered or because I was eating too much due to being hungry.

Good luck with it, regardless. I’m currently dealing with the opposite issue and if anything that’s even weirder, but I know how bad extreme hunger can be so I can sympathise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I get started and realize I can’t stop I chug at least 20oz of water (usually more)Then I physically cannot fit anything else and I’m soooo uncomfortable I have to just lay down for a while.",isarosebella,1573913735.0,2019-11-16 08:15:35,"I do believe you can stop. If someone else did it, you can too.

I’m a 19 y/o female &amp; I’ve been struggling with binging after a multitude of eating disorders throughout high school. It’s been about a year now of just binging,  and I recently started seeing a therapist. Now, I did my own research too &amp; followed some positive eating accounts on Instagram &amp; that had provided me a tremendous amount of tips to start getting my balanced relationship with food back. 

The #1 thing to do is have no boundaries on what you can and can’t eat. Tell yourself you can eat whatever you want, whenever you want. Your body knows what you want &amp; what you need. You’ll eventually see this, and find yourself having really clear hunger cues &amp; fullness cues. It takes time. 

1. Allow yourself to eat the foods that you normally wouldn’t. For me, it was carbs. I never let myself eat any carbs (bread, rice, etc.) because I was convinced I didn’t need them. This would lead me to binge. I restricted myself, so I binged. Maybe try going out a couple times a week &amp; getting that crazy meal you normally wouldn’t. I now eat rice EVERYDAY because I just want to. Burrito bowls for life. 

2. My therapist had told me that if I was to be put in inpatient care, they would make me eat breakfast, and then a breakfast snack. Then lunch, followed by a lunch snack (which was always the heaviest, a brownie, a milkshake, etc.) Then dinner, followed by a dinner snack. 

SO, I began to eat a heavy lunch snack everyday. Allowing myself to have it. I did this for a while, and I enjoyed it! I didn’t feel guilt after because I allowed myself to eat it &amp; knew that it wasn’t going to affect me nearly as much as I thought. Eventually, some days I didn’t WANT a lunch snack. I didn’t have that crazy binge feeling I normally would. I knew I wasn’t in the mood for it, so I just went on with my day. But I did eat brownies and rainbow cookies every single afternoon for some weeks. 

3. Don’t label food as “good” and “bad”. Everything is okay in moderation. Don’t label the cake as a bad food, just let yourself eat some until your satisfied, and it’ll pay off down the road as far as not feeling the need to binge goes. When I labeled a food as bad, I tend to avoid that food, which led me to binge that food. 


Some days are good days, some days are bad days. I didn’t always feel 100% doing this, but I kept myself believing that it would help. I recently found myself not eating foods because they weren’t “healthy” and I literally felt my eating disorder thoughts &amp; habits spring to life. So today I’ll be eating my lunch snack &amp; enjoying it. 

I think it’s all about restriction. The more you restrict, the more you’ll binge and lash out. Everybody is different but you will find your balance. 

Just want to let you know, I did gain weight from this. And I have not been weighing myself, but I could tell because my jeans all went up a size or two. That is the only reason I noticed. Mentally, I feel good. Physically, I’m going to admit I’m not 100% with it. Some days I feel amazing &amp; others it’s like I can’t get out of this funk. But trusting that doing these things will lead me to feeling so much better mentally with food down the road keeps me going. Cause that’s all I want! Hope this helps you in some way. Sorry it’s so long. 


Lastly, these are my favorite Instagram accounts. They’ve helped me tremendously.

I guess what I am saying is stopping the purging was the first step, but there is still a ways to go. Keep at it. Some things that help me are planning meals, avoiding foods I know will trigger me (eating really healthy seems to dial my urges back, so I avoid sweets and white flour but eat plenty of oatmeal, whole grains, etc). I try to keep myself occupied and make sure I get some exercise because it helps my mood. And most of all remember that you beat purging, you can beat binging.

She talks A LOT about the think/feel/act cycle: tracing how an urge that pops into your head can lead to an uncomfortable feeling or emotion, and that emotion can lead to an action. I’ve found her explanations really helpful for stopping bingeing and purging.",toasttocoast,1574856999.0,2019-11-27 06:16:39,"Sorry this was really long lol but i hope it helps \~

First, I wanna say I'm not qualified to give psychiatric advice haha, and I think that therapy with someone specializing in EDs is the best course of action. Obviously that's not available to everyone, but if you can seek professional help then do it! Cognitive behavioral therapy with a qualified person is the best course of action. 

Anyways...I c/s at least a few times a month but I've often found myself getting addicted to it and wanting to do multiple times a day or multiple days in a row, so when that happens I try really hard to pull back on it.  I know that I'll probably do it again, but that doesn't mean I have to do it RIGHT NOW.  

What helps me is focusing on the negatives of c/sing, but it's important that you **don't** do it in a way that promotes feelings of shame of guilt.  I take note of how my body feels bad after doing it - my face is red and greasy, I'm sweaty, I feel weirdly bloated and puffy all over (maybe from high sodium intake), my throat hurts, my mouth hurts, my jaw hurts....etc. I try to not hate myself for inducing those physical effects, but I try to remember them for next time an urge hits and am able to convince myself that it's actually not worth the physical effects.

Furthermore, I try to remember how I feel emotionally before, during, and after.  Before, I am usually anxious and/or bored, during I am in a weird sort of disassociated state, and afterwards, I feel even more anxious, combined with feeling guilt/shame/depression/lethargy. So, it obviously didn't solve my initial mental state, and in fact made it worse.  And those feelings of shame, etc, can last much longer than the time right after c/sing.  I try to snap myself out of the ""plan"" to c/s and try to logically consider how it won't solve my problems and will probably make them worse.  The few studies done on c/sing (mostly just compiled from interviews with people who do it) obviously show that engaging in the behavior increases feelings of guilt, shame, poor body image (maybe even moreso than other ED behaviors, but it's usually combined with other behaviors so who knows), feelings of low self-worth, etc.

And lastly...just because c/sing seems less damaging than heavy restriction or binging/purging, doesn't mean that it can't cause serious long term adverse health effects.  There haven't been enough studies on chewing and spitting, but there is evidence that it can cause physical problems. There have been some studies that show that c/sing makes you gain weight because it can massively fuck with your hormones, like insulin, even if you aren't swallowing more food. It also seems to have an effect on the hormones ghrelin and obestatin which have a role in hunger/satiety.  C/sing can increase ghrelin, which increases our hunger and food-seeking behaviors. C/sing can end up making you hungrier in the long run and makes it so that your body doesn't know when it's full. We have no idea what the long term ramifications of this are when it comes to c/sing, but let's just assume it's not beneficial. 

And don't forget cavities, stomach ulcers, swollen salivary glands....c/sing can seriously fuck up your teeth over time because of how much food you can easily go through in a short period of time without swallowing.  Plus, most people tend to c/s really carb-heavy/sugary foods that can cause cavities and other mouth issues. And you really don't want an ulcer.

If all else fails and you ARE going to c/s *right now*, please try to do it in a safe way.  It's important to eat at a least a little bit so that your stomach acid has something to interact with instead of just chilling in your empty stomach fucking shit up.  Swallow some bread, lettuce, crackers, banana, or whatever you can. Don't brush your teeth right afterwards, even if you feel like you need to, because your enamel is already compromised from all the food.  Wait at least an hour to brush/floss.  Chewing an antacid might be beneficial, too. 

Lastly, sometimes I think about the waste of money it is...but that usually makes me feel more shame and guilt which really isn't helping and can promote the behavior. But it also feels good to think about how I saved $10-$20 when I wanted to but didn't go buy junk just to spit it into a bowl!

Good luck &lt;3",drinksriracha,1574859022.0,2019-11-27 06:50:22,"So, I don't have much advice, but I do want you to know that you aren't alone. I have c/sed for HOURS every day for years, even stealing food and c/sing in front of people. You aren't alone there. I am very much addicted.

I do not practice c/s nearly as much more. Maybe an hour a day which some might think is a lot but is nowhere near as much as I used to. Some days I go without. 

What helped me to stop doing it as much was treating it as intermittent fasting. 20 hours of fasting from c/s, 4 hours of doing it a day. And then slowly cut back on the hours of c/sing. Allowing yourself one block to c/s vs doing it throughout the day helps as well. 

I find that the more times you c/s in a day the more you want to continue to do it because it triggers your ghrelin. Limit it to one block a day.

I have also gone cold turkey, thrown out all my c/s food, and quit. It lasted a while but I really like to c/s and started back up again.  I often get very compulsive with it and have to cut back again. It kind of comes in waves now.",mylessandovaldpt,1574863932.0,2019-11-27 08:12:12,"The big secret of urges is that they can't harm you.

376,e1w95x,Sereniv,1574772705.0,2019-11-26 06:51:45,"the key is to change your relationship with food. when you hate food you think about it, and when you love it you think about it. both can suck with an ED.

maybe try learning about foods and what the do. not about health, but about what your body naturally needs

I'll try not to use any trigger words, but the thing ppl usually count, you need those. those are part of energy

The way we think of those is wrong. it's not the thing that's important 

But above all else, appreciate those for helping your body acquire energy. Thank c*rbs for doing it too

but I've been doing research about the health part of 

food, and I've learned to see parts of food as good because of how we need them 

like with counting C's, like with c*rbs, the scare tactics come from empty C's and c*rbs. But everyone thinks it's just those things in general 

and empty c's isnt bad. you arent bad. 

your heart pumps blood throughout your body, and iron helps carry the oxygen along with it. That's one reason we need iron

C*rbs and protien and C's all play a different roll in energy, something that keeps our engine running.

Focus on the facts. something that science says is true. And this does not include the BMI index because if you look into it, it's not scientifically correct and has racism intertwined in it. The person who created it was not qualified to make it. It's like asking a fire fighter to be your therapist 

I'm sorry if this doesnt make sense or doesnt help, cant explain myself well

but basically, you gotta change your relationship with food. and doing your research on how food works, can help you not see it as such an evil. bc I know sometimes I see food almost as an entity, it's bad 

but once I learned more, and though I still have an ED, I have started to appreciate food. I'm less angry at myself because I chose to fuel myself with nutrients 

but it doesn't work for everyone and it can depend on your past, how you acquired you ED, etc

but yeah if you want to stop thinking about food you need to start thinking about it. why do you think about why do you hate it ask yourself questions and get to the bottom to why you feel the way you do

you dont deserve this, it's not your fault, and you are worthy of happiness. you can get through this and I dont know you but I know I'm proud of you for being here and for fighting. keep fighting for yourself and give yourself a hug and be there for you who is suffering. Things will get better. I cant say when, but you just have to keep fighting until they do. fight for the day you look in the mirror and smile. dont let anyone even yourself say that'll never happen.",ReptilesWithMatthew,1579199272.0,2020-01-16 12:27:52,Disconnect yourself from food.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was so sure I would never recover, I was terrified of dying trapped inside the personal hell I created. I accepted it though — which I should have never done.

380,dzzcfl,clueless_chinchilla,1574452794.0,2019-11-22 13:59:54,"It's hard. Often these disorders are coping for other problems or feelings that can't be dealt with appropriately. There isn't necessarily anything you can do to help or heal someone with an eating disorder. They're competitive and distrustful. If you try to interfere with it, it may make things worse, or make the person suffering less likely to come to you.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the best piece of advice I can give is to be supportive, encouraging, but be careful not to put pressure or expectations. Don't try to force meals or force food. Don't try to talk about it--don't talk about your own food thoughts, your own weight thoughts, etc. Often this exacerbates the competitive nature of most eating disorders. Even the best intended advice given can be taken wrong. You'd be surprised at the mental gymnastics that people with eating disorders will go through to frame comments in a negative light. The brain is very good at keeping our sick selves sick.

&amp;#x200B;

Give assurance. Give reassurance. Not talking about or forcing food doesn't mean enable them to not eat. But rather, consider things that may give them less anxiety to eat. Or, letting them know that they \*deserve\* to have nutrition. they /deserve/ to be well. Avoid terms like ""you're healthy"" ""you look healthy/fit/normal"". Try to avoid saying body shape-related things in general.

It’s best to talk to a therapist, and/or support group if you can! They would know what it’s like to have a loved one with an ED, and how to manage how it effects you, as well as your family and it’s dynamic. 

Remember, that while your wife may struggle herself, it doesn’t mean she has the right to treat you poorly, or have a evident, fraught relationship with food around your daughter! I know plenty of women who have children, and when they relapse, still make sure to eat with their children, to avoid such.

Unfortunately eating disorders are hard and it’s more than just the food issue that needs to heal. 

If your wife is acting out against you it’s definitely because she is in pain herself.

You need to start the conversation with your wife but it isn’t an easy topic to bring up. I would suggest finding some resources about how to approach your wife first. 

My biggest suggestion would be to make sure you are coming from a place that is showing visible love, concern, and calm. As someone who has struggled with eating issues, the most hurtful and unproductive conversations have focused on how I look and on my weight. I already know that my weight issues are a result of my eating disorder - having that be the focus only hurts more.",karupiin,1574480104.0,2019-11-22 21:35:04,"EDs run in my family. Me, my sister, my mom, my uncle, and my grandmother all have an ED of some sort. My little sister (not the one with the ED) is someone I worry about constantly. She’s much younger than I am, only 11, but she grew up in a house with three women who had EDs. She’s very vigilant about that stuff, she’s seen me looking into a mirror and instinctively knew I was criticizing myself, she hugged me and told me I look great. She’s very slim and athletic and still worries about her body so I worry that she will develop one as well. I’ve had my eating disorder since I was even younger than 11, she could already have one for all I know. 
My advice is to have a GOOD talk about this with your wife. You are 100% valid in being worried for your daughter, I would be too. 
Make sure you teach your daughter healthy eating habits, and never make her feel ashamed for ANYTHING she eats. GUILT is a main factor in eating disorders, remember this. A major reason I developed anorexia is because of my mother criticizing my eating habits from an early age and never teaching me proper eating habits. My mother is bulimic and would always eat in secret/by herself so we never sat down for proper meals at proper times, she would occasionally make me dinner and then I had to just raid the snack cabinet/fridge for all my other meals. My whole life I never had breakfast, and would often just skip lunch at school because she never packed me anything and the school lunches were not appealing to me since I’m a picky eater. In the end this lead to me only eating dinner, and I would eat a lot at once which made my mother angry because she thought I was binging even though it was my only meal that day. Even now, being a full grown adult who does not live with her, I only eat at night, even when I’m trying to eat normally. The only food I can bring myself to eat during the day is meal replacement bars. 
I never had a father, maybe if I had a caring and supportive dad to make sure I was properly fed things would have been very different. Your daughter is so lucky to have a father like you who cares! 
There’s only so much you can singlehandedly do, your wife has a lot more she needs to do to make sure your daughter grows up with a healthy attitude towards food and her body. Your wife needs to realize that her eating disorder is not just about herself anymore, children pick up on behaviors very easily and it’s not something they can simply un-learn when they are older. If your daughter develops an ED, it could be what kills her. 
Also, as someone very stuck in their disordered habits, I know it won’t be easy for your wife to just stop having an eating disorder. What she really needs to do is pay close attention to what your daughter sees and hears. She needs to NEVER criticize her own appearance or her eating in front of your daughter. 
You can’t control your wife’s actions, she might never change because eating disorders can make people very selfish. Even if she doesn’t change, just do the best you can. Love your daughter no matter what, be positive with her, always be encouraging. Never give up on her. Make sure she NEVER feels unloved. I really REALLY hope your daughter never has to go through this terrible disease. And I hope your wife can get better too.",juniorasparagus13,1574484907.0,2019-11-22 22:55:07,"Sometimes kids that young just go through weird phases, especially if they have had a big change or a trauma come up.

I really hope you find some good resources that are affordable. My heart goes out to you knowing that often help is so hard to get with hoops to jump through and financially prohibitive medications and treatments. My advise would be to find some affordable support groups where you can meet regularly. This will hopefully give you two things, 1) a support system of understanding friends, 2) all of those people are on similar paths and likely have tips on helpful resources that you may not be aware of in your area. Finding people that are in similar situations and are a few steps ahead of you in the process can be very helpful. Positive loving relationships can be one of the best ways to heal, although it takes everything in us to reach out and participate in healthy relationships when all we want to do is pull away. 

A positive way to look at this is that expensive treatment options come with their own set of issues. Because they are so expensive, there is a lot of pressure for it to work quickly and completely. I may be wrong, but any treatment is going to take time and will likely be a stepping stone towards recovery so putting that pressure on yourself to recover too quickly because it's expensive could backfire.

Part of this was my anxiety with eating food, being asked about food, being told what people are cooking even when it sounds really cool and exciting.

I also hated eating around other people, I was afraid I was being judged for what I was eating, when I was eating it, how much I was eating etc etc. I know you say counseling isn't an option as you are in the military, but why is that the case? Is there simply a lack of services? If so I am really sorry about that. If not, is it just the idea of it makes it feel like it isn't an option? Even just a few sessions of counseling could help you figuring out why you get the feelings of anxiety you do when you eat/have conversations around food.

Just for context, I may have disordered eating triggered by depression triggered by loss of my spouse to cancer. I managed to keep it under the wraps so to speak but have been losing weight  due to unknown nausea and also underweight now with some bloodwork issues so it’s becoming a “topic”.

Anyhow, regarding other things, my psychologist has done the “this is why...” thing a few times and sometimes I agree it’s possible but if I do not, I’m not afraid to say I disagree. I often disagree with stuff he suggests but I think he also suggests things he knows isn’t true just to get me to talk (sneaky but known tactic).

Are you comfortable telling your psychologist you disagree? Because then you could explore why and what you think is the reason or why it isn’t the reason... Because if you don’t think he/she has the right root issue, then it will be difficult to fix the problem, right? You can suggest that to her...

I try for 15 little meals a day and make sure to eat breakfast and try not to eat super late. I found after 9pm I would almost always binge eat, I find it is way more common to binge eat late at night rather than early in the day. Try to keep yourself to a planned schedule and snack a lot that way you can keep yourself in a libo of in between being extremely hunger and binge eating to the point of extreme full. Because if you starve yourself you will just binge and you need to try and not be super full all the time from binges. I also would try and eat more dense foods that will fill you up quicker for example, potatoes. Another thing that helped me also not binge eat is when you are eating try and focus on what you are eating. Do not eat in front of the TV or while on the computer, that way you are aware of what you are eating. If you do binge eat also do not give up the day or give up trying. It took me many many failures before I was able to start having some successes. You can do it! Focus in when you do succeed and do not just throw the day away because you accidentally binge ate.

I was sliding into binge and stress and over eating again and had no motivation to do anything. I’ve been there before and I didn’t like where I was heading. Lately I’ve been trying to reconceptualise what “fullness” should be to me. For a while I didn’t interpret anything below a 9 on the hunger-fullness scale as full but I’ve been slowly training myself to get back to recognising a 7 as full and I’ve been feeling a lot better as this is a much more physically comfortable level of fullness for me. I think this part is mostly about re training your brain consciously if that makes sense? 
I’ve also been watching a few videos about conceptualising self-control as a muscle rather than a “i either have it or I don’t” thing. I think that’s been helping me shift from a mindset of “i can’t stop” and “i need this” to kind of making the choice to train my self-control muscle and patting myself on the back for it which has felt really good. 
Along the same line of that I’ve also been forcing myself to make time for exercise again and been trying to follow along the blogilates workout calendar a few days a week when I’m not busy in the evenings and the feeling of achievement from pushing myself and getting through a couple really tough workouts has been helping me feel a lot better about myself too. 

Would love to hear from you to know if you’re doing a bit better and hope you find something to feel more like yourself again!

Remember your neurological pathway has been engrained to lead to a dark place while many other people flippantly adhere to thoughts one day and toss them out the next. Even if they prescribe by those ideas and hold on to them until they are disordered you now have the clarity and mental acuity to recognize where those thoughts are coming from and why. You have the experience to know how dangerous and ultimately destructive they can be. I've really struggled with this same thing. There are only a couple people in my life I really hold to the standard of confronting when I feel triggered because they are vigilant enough advocates for me to take that seriously and adjust...most other people are relatively thoughtless about things they can't understand and that's most of the world. It's painful but it's also important to learn to recognize then identity and label those things what they are, I constantly wish to be insulated because it is emotionally unnerving, but at the end of the day we have to build the ideals we want the world we want within us, and use demonstration to encourage others to behave in a way we visualize as positive and helpful",tymopa,1575359604.0,2019-12-03 01:53:24,So you put her comfort before yours?

For example: You're afraid of that banana???!! What? You're joking, right? Wtf! They really can't understand. So it's perfectly normal for your friends to talk about their bodies or food in everyday conversation and can you ask them not to? I guess but it's a pretty big part of normal life and they may forget that it's taboo because it's such a common topic to not be able to talk about occasionally.

I use to get so down and think no one cared about me because they would from time to time forget and say something about how they were happy the scale went down. I finally realized that in in charge of my triggers and not everyone else  I decide if what so an so said about losing weight is going to cause me to restrict or i'm going to decide to remain strong and just congratulate my friend on her weight loss and be a good supportive friend to her.

Yay!!",gremsie,1575292870.0,2019-12-02 07:21:10,"The main thing about eating disorders in general is that it’s “not about the food” - rather the underlying issues that make one lean on an ED to cope. Generally it’s not hard to have basic understanding of good nutrition (not only is the internet a great resource, but specifically reddit is a superb one...just make sure to look in the right places). Best thing to do is to read psychological literature (by this I mean a combination of philosophy, ED recovery books, psychology and stuff geared towards depression/anxiety/mindfulness) and you can also read nutritional literature too (Wikipedia, videos on YouTube - there are plenty of engaging fun videos, like a 10 min long video from a channel called Casually Explained that’s humorous).   


The internet is the best resource. For almost anything you want to do. Cheaper, faster, better than most institutions or services these days.

Or clinics? 

It's not ideal, but a lot of schooling programs offer affordable, or free, resources for those local (it gives the students a chance to refine their skills, and provide more affordable resources for the community). So, maybe see if you can find a therapist and nutritionist or even a GP through that? 

It's rough - I've been there, only my last insurance wouldn't cover nutritionists more than 1x a year, with diabetes being the only exception. For a year I had to fight them, but it was helpful, to work with a nutritionist along side my therapist. Finding a therapist that was used to working with ED patients was helpful too, as she didn't just give me a meal plan, but helped me to identify challenges, had me email her throughout the week, and also kept an eye on my diet. 

If you aren't able to find one, try using an app like Recovery Road, as they're free! And if you end up working with a team down the road, many programs and specialists use them - so you can just email or print the records. 

The app is helpful, as it essentially walks you through mindful eating/CBT, etc., since it tracks your episodes/behaviors, urges, how you feel before/after eating, what you eat, and you can even track meal exchanges, if you want to see a nutritionists once, to get an exchange program, then work on your own for a while.

However I'm not really in recovery at this time so I didn't use it, but it would definitely be helpful if you're in recovery.",gnosiscna,1575323203.0,2019-12-02 15:46:43,"Someone mentioned below recovery record.

I’m not sure how it works without a dietitian linked to it (they can adjust suggested exchanges, meal ideas, etc) but every time you log a meal or snack, you get a cute picture or an encouraging quote!

For the dietitian aspect, some work on a sliding scale depending on your income. Maybe your therapist has some connections with other therapists that do have knowledge of EDs and know of local dietitians?

For accountability, do you have a trusted friend or family member? Once I texted a friend whenever I ate a meal (vice versa) and what I had. It kept both of us accountable for keeping ourselves nourished and it was always fun to figure out new meal ideas from each other!

Major stressors? Any new medication? All of those things could potentially cause appetite suppression. 

Sometimes the winter can be very hard. I live in the Midwest and most of the winter is &lt; 20°F and gray skies/no sunlight. Seasonal depression symptoms can manifest in different ways — one of those is diet and weight changes. Sometimes you just don’t want to do anything, you don’t care about anything, and you start to ignore body signals like hunger or fullness. Sometimes it’s about being able to control just one thing in life, and sometimes it’s unintentional. I’ve had days where I do nothing but sit at home alone and I don’t realize until when I’m in a bad mood later that I haven’t eaten much. 

One thing that helps me keep a more normal sleep/wake/food intake cycle in the winter is light therapy. It helps a lot of people feel more like their normal self because it helps bring serotonin and melatonin to regular levels. I got a light box online for around $30 and I highly recommend it for anyone feeling suddenly “off” during the colder months. But disclaimer: light therapy can be triggering for people with bipolar and can occasionally spike them into mania. Check with your doctor or psychiatrist, if you have one, before trying a light box. 

And honestly just having a routine can help too. It teaches your brain “we eat at this time in the day.” This is just from my own experience and I’m still trying to work it out myself and keep a regular food intake schedule.

And the decreased sex drive makes me think it could be depression, as well. It can masquerade as a lot of different things and make you feel like there’s something innately wrong with you when really you just need serotonin.

also know that your role is to be a friend, not a therapist she can dump all her emotions on. sometimes it can be overbearing and you're allowed to set boundaries by creating space for yourself in a way that doesn't dismiss her. it sounds like you're a great friend since you want to support her, and if you google ways to support someone with an ED and do your research you'll find a lot of ways to be a good support :-) good luck!",tymopa,1576220737.0,2019-12-13 01:05:37,"I think most of this is good advice except for bringing up how she looks.

I'd say the best way to deal with it is to just be open with them about how they're affecting you (which could open a conversation about how you might be affecting them as well). That way, they can try their best to not trigger you as much as they can (for example, they could adjust how they talk about certain things). That might help make them a little less triggering.",SemicolonButterfly,1577234474.0,2019-12-24 18:41:14,"My perspective is that there will always be unavoidable triggers, and that’s ok!

Yes, there are some situations that I will choose to avoid or plan carefully for (large gatherings, clothes shopping) but I don’t want fear to rule me anymore.


The value for me in identifying things with the potential to start that emotional spiral (aka ‘triggers’) is that this self-awareness offers protection. I’m better able to spot the avalanche as it’s just beginning and employ some predetermined tools. Essentially I can de-escalate myself.


A suggestion I’ve used is to start a list of identified triggers and a companion list of tools I can use to support myself. An example for me is that seeing or hearing ambulances sends me into a spiral of bad memories. My tools so far are to repeat to myself “that is not happening to me right now” along with breathing exercises and then get into a distraction activity. With the more directly ED stuff, where I’m at is to focus on the positive things I’m able to have when I take care of my body. But the great thing is it’s a collection tools that’s ever improving as I learn and practice.

I'd like to offer a suggestion in addition to the two fantastic posts above. 

Have you considered exploring the feelings you have toward your sister?

Is the relationship competitive? 
Does she understand how her eating disorder behaviors affect you?
Is there an unresolved issue between you?
Would you feel equally triggered by someone else (not your sister) doing the same things your sister does?

You acknowledged a two-way, competitive relationship:

""We have quite a competitive relationship, and are both well aware...""

Questions to consider:

When did the the competitive behavior between you and your sister start?
What motivates the competition?
What maintains the behavior?
What is the goal? 
What needs are being met through the behavior?
What needs are NOT being met through the behavior?
How has it benefitted you? How has it benefitted your sister? How has it hurt you? How has it hurt your sister?


The response to your sister's eating disorder behavior differs from your response to eating disorder behavior you observe in others:

""I definitely feel triggered by other people doing the same things she does, but not nearly as much as I do with her.""

What are the thoughts behind the triggered feelings brought on by your sister? 
How are they different than the thoughts you have when triggered by others?
Why does your sister's behavior bother you more?
How would you describe the relationship between you and your sister?

You are aware of the unhealthy competition, but have hesitated to dig deeper in private thought:

""It’s a really good point though and I guess something that I often try not to think about...""

What are you avoiding?
What will happen if you think about it in greater depth?
How do you feel about discussing it with your sister? What would happen if you opened a discussion about the competitiveness in the relationship to your sister?
Do you feel like the issue can be resolved?

Props for reaching out. Thinking about something you've avoided to think about is challenging, but it's worth doing so when you're ready.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I recently read *The Brain That Changes Itself* which has a section specifically on OCD and might be a helpful read. That book really gave me hope that I can change my thought patterns. And children’s brains can adapt even more readily than my adult brain!


I also thought of *Turtles All the Way Down* by John Green. It’s young adult fiction but the teenage protagonist struggles with anxiety/OCD surrounding germs and I thought the author did an excellent job capturing what the worry spiral and intrusive thoughts can feel like. Just thought of it because maybe it could help give you a glimpse into that sort of emotional experience?

Hes simply amazing.,akatsuki_no_bun,1577719720.0,2019-12-30 09:28:40,"It sounds like you have a very stressed out little guy on your hands! Especially since he’s so young, I’d guess something really freaked him out and he’s struggling to cope. Has anything stressful happened to him lately?

I had pretty bad OCD as a little kid, I think it really helped my mom to know that the symptoms were about stress and when things in my environment or home changed/ were stressing me out I was more symptomatic. She’d ask me what had happened in my day when I was telling her I didn’t want to touch anything/ was upset. She was never like “see that’s why you’re thinking that way” but would just ask me about my feelings and talking about the stressor helped the symptoms in the moment (I’m pretty sure she had a talk with my therapist about how to do motivational interviewing but I thought she was just really good at calming me down)

I worked with a therapist and did a ton of exposure therapy (basically I did all the things that I was scared of and sat through the discomfort), which I hated and I hated my therapist but it helped. For me a big thing was not avoiding the fear, as avoiding it or trying to get it to go away with rituals was what fed the OCD but everyone’s different. That being said as much as it sucks exposure (when done with a clinician) really helps OCD, officially I “grew out” of mine, which is sort of weird but I was 6-12 when it was bad, and I grew up? For a lot of people it’s a life long thing but I think getting therapy and working on it when I was young was why it’s not a problem now. I definitely have the tendency towards OCD but I also have the tools to address it 😊",Anonnnoommouse,1577720298.0,2019-12-30 09:38:18,"First and foremost I’m so sorry that you’re going through this. I was diagnosed with PANDAS when I was 6, many doctors at first thought that it was an extreme case of OCD but it was a lot more complicated than that, I’m only 17 so I don’t have very much medical advice but I agree with the above comments on finding a doctor that you like, and keep trying until you do. I was put on antibiotics (azithromycin) for a year and eventually I grew out of it, this doesn’t happen to everyone but it is very possible and highly likely. I do have some suggestions maybe coming from another point of view because I know how emotionally tolling it was on me and the people closest to me. My family has shared that their biggest regret was getting so mad that they couldn’t control the irrationality; they would yell and that would send me into a fit of hysteria, much like any disorder you can find on here it’s due to a disordered brain whatever the reason(s) may be and unfortunately no matter how mad or loud you get you can’t change that. Many other things came along with my lack of appetite and horror of food, I’m not sure if you’re experiencing any of these things but I was scared (all irrational) that any dressing was poison my parents were putting on food because they were tired of my drama, if I slept in my bed the wrong way then someone could kill me, checking locks, not knowing what was real and not real. I remember one time I was so terrified of lying, I thought that something absolutely terrible was going to happen if I did so I didn’t say anything that was a statement for a week and I couldn’t tell my mother I loved her and she was so hurt because she didn’t understand at first. Don’t take any irrational thinking personally. Just be as understanding as possible, it sounds like you are, just explaining what’s real over and over helps, it’s a lot of repeating and I’m so sorry you’re going through this.. I’m sure the appreciation will be absolutely endless once he understands the complexities that you had to deal with through motherhood. I hope really that it’s not that bad, it definitely comes with it’s struggles and joining support groups and reaching out to other people so you know what to expect or how to deal with it I think would be highly beneficial, I know you said it could be OCD or Anorexia but I definitely wanted to open up about the PANDAS part because that’s something that you hear about less, OCD and Anorexia can both fall under that blanket.. If you ever want to hear more information please, please reach out to me.",the_scientist52,1577725203.0,2019-12-30 11:00:03,"I'm so sorry that you're going through this. I'm sure it feels absolutely horrible and I want to commend you for all of the care you're putting into his treatment.  He's very lucky to have you!  

I'm not a professional but in my opinion it doesn't sound like he has anorexia.  People with anorexia struggle with body image and an intense fear of gaining weight, and it doesn't sound like he has those types of concerns.  The fact that he's so young also leads me away from that potential diagnosis.  While it isn't impossible for small children to display anorexic tendencies, it typically doesn't occur at such a young age.  And when it does show up in younger children, it's usually the thoughts surrounding body image or weight gain that start at that point--full blown restrictive behaviors tend to develop a bit later.

To me it sounds like the OCD/PANDAS route is the most likely, because the specific anxieties you mentioned aren't related to his weight but to things that tend to be common in those with OCD (and I'm assuming PANDAS, although I admittedly don't know much about that diagnosis).  I struggled with anxiety at his age and while my fears weren't related to eating, the anxiety was quite intense and difficult to rationalize with because I was so young.  And even now as an adult, I have trouble talking myself out of anxiety even though I'm aware that it makes no logical sense--so that could explain why trying to be logical with him hasn't helped much.   

If it does end up being considered an anxiety-related issue I'm expecting that they'll want to do exposure therapy to help him get used to eating and drinking again.  I'm also wondering if something in particular triggered his anxiety, like if there was some sort of traumatic event that set the ball rolling.  It wouldn't even have to be related to eating, as anxiety about one thing can manifest in other ways.  I think that the child psychology team will be working to try to find the root cause of the anxiety and can help treat that as well to prevent situations like this from arising again.",Kehndy12,1577726511.0,2019-12-30 11:21:51,"I don't have advice but I have a question.

I was a vegetarian during my recovery and still managed to eat with as little environmental impact as was possible. Depending on where you are from, many foods (particularly fruit and veg) have been flown thousands of kilometres to get to you; some ""super foods"" such as quinoa are being grown in countries where it used to be a staple food but now the demand from the western world is so high, that producers can't even afford their own produce. If you eat nut butter (which most healthy vegans would include for fats and protein supplementation), the nuts have likely travelled far and, depending on the brand, may contain palm oil (loads of food contains this) which is detrimental to the environment.

Take care of yourself 🌟",sunflowersadly,1579094182.0,2020-01-15 07:16:22,"Yeah I have to some extent - because I know being too rigid with any diet will tempt me to restrict, I eat a vegan diet at home, or when I go out and order my own food (I live in an area which makes this super easy for me, lots of vegan options!), but when someone else cooks for me or everyone is sharing food at a restaurant which isn’t vegan, I’ll just eat whatever everyone else is eating.  This isn’t because I miss animal products and need an excuse to eat them, but it’s because having an eating disorder is super socially isolating, and so I need to remind myself of the joy of sharing food with loved ones, and also just to be careful not to let myself get too strict in any way with food.  It’s really worked for me.  Obviously it means I can’t truly call myself a vegan, but it means I eat vegan food 90% of the time and every little helps!

However, I live in a big city with so many vegan options that I don’t really feel restricted at all by my food choices anyway... if you live somewhere with few vegan choices, it might be more of a restrictive trigger, and everybody is different, so I can’t say my experience will be the same for anyone else!",11pharmacycalls,1579094270.0,2020-01-15 07:17:50,"Had horrendous complications, realized humans are omnivores.

One of the biggest things that helped me not only transition to being vegan (for 2 years now) was adding things to my diet before taking things away!

By this I mean instead of cutting out dairy milk I made sure to find a plant milk that I like! Instead of cutting out meat entirely I made an effort to learn to cook lots of recipes I loved using chickpeas, beans, tofu, and lentils. And I found other vegan foods to replace former staples in my diet.

This way it didnt feel like I was restricting or focusing too much on what I was making or the food I was eating. I was just eating new foods that I loved.

However, it has been six years since I last engaged in my ED and I would recommend being very careful. I think it is possible to stay healthy as a vegan, but due to the added nutritional challenges, your family needs to be 100% on board. It is very easy to suffer nutritional deficiencies on a vegan diet and these can make it very easy to slip back into restrictive behaviors. Maybe meet with a nutritionist (and bring your parents if they are willing) and come up with a meal plan. If you parents are not willing to help you, I think you may be better off waiting until you are in the position to buy your own groceries and meal plan for yourself.",flyingsqueak,1579108414.0,2020-01-15 11:13:34,"I became vegan as I was entering recovery. For me it was both environmental and as a way to take control of something with my body. This was about ten years ago, and while I've had a few ED relapses, I've mostly maintained a healthy weight and healthy food habits. 

But I did that as an adult living on my own. (kind of, it was part of leaving an abusive relationship) That would not have worked if I couldn't control what food was available in the house. You need to choose what you are eating, rather than choosing what you ""can't eat"".

I'd really recommend waiting until you are on your own.

I think it is very possible, but I gradually transitioned from vegetarian to vegan, slowly cutting out foods as I added more to my diet. I would imagine this would be challenging as a teen living at home not being able to shop for yourself. Maybe as you transition into adulthood, you can slowly substitute non veg items for veg ones. For instance, cut out red meat first and try some legumes you don’t normally eat, like lentils. I think the support of your family is crucial on this one, and mine was very apprehensive when I went veg because they thought it was simply to restrict. 

Take it slow, and if you feel yourself being triggered remember that you need to take care of yourself as a priority. You have your whole life ahead of you and even if it doesn’t happen immediately, it doesn’t mean it never will ❤️ feel free reach out with any questions you might have :)",Simplicityobsessed,1579109918.0,2020-01-15 11:38:38,"I've been vegan for a while - and vegetarian. I remained vegan throughout my relapses, and recoveries. I now am in a pretty healthy place- I workout too, and I'd consider myself largely recovered. I was vegetarian/vegan before developing a restrictive ED, which may be a big part of why it didn't impact my ED recovery.

For me? It was all about a mindset change - about focusing on the cool new things I could try, versus the ones that I was restricted to, as a vegan. For me, dietary restrictions have also been a huge trigger in the past, and I simply expanded my plate, and committed to trying new things, so that it wasn't restrictive.

If you live in an area that is not friendly to vegans, this may be hard. I live in a rather liberal state, and near big cities, where vegan food is common. I am also okay with/have been able to always find the time to cook - so I can't possibly get away with lying to myself and excusing neglecting to eat. If you don't live in an area like this and/or have the ability to cook, it may end very differently. I don't fully understand why too, but it made me feel more connected to, and at ease with my food (being vegan that is). 

If you feel like it may impact your recovery, then do what you can without sacrificing your health. People may disagree (some vegans/vegetarians can be ironically un-sympathetic with people regarding this....), but every little bit counts. If you replace one gallon of milk with almond milk once a week? It helps. If you pass up a burger for a veggie burger, or eggs for tofu once a week? it helps. You don't have to commit to a completely 100% vegan diet, to make a difference. There are also plenty of resources on zero waste, and other lifestyle factors you can change to make a difference. One of those is buying locally too!

Look at it this way - if you don't take care of yourself and address your ED, you'll end up not being able to advocate for the environment, and at worst, contributing to it by ending up binge eating/etc (for me, this is when I make the worst environmental decisions).

Your health should always come first - and if you want to pursue this, make sure you find a way to do it educated and with lots of support!",HobnobA,1579111389.0,2020-01-15 12:03:09,"Yes!

There are too many restrictive excuses which could ultimately lead to exacerbating eating disordered patterns or malnutrition.

I am personally a vegan who has recovered from an eating disorder (several), however I am also a counselling psychologist and work in an eating disorder service.

My first piece of advice would be to feel as though you are generally recovered (as much as we can ever be) before taking on a vegan diet. Other peoples advice here about starting out more slowly make sense. I would also say that you need to make sure you are eating a very varied and as much as possible non restrictive vegan diet. Luckily where I live in England I can almost eat an identical diet to my diet before veganism because of the amount of vegan substitutes and the amount of options when eating out, but if that isn't possible get to grips with cooking/baking delicious and nutritious vegan meals for yourself so you dont feel deprived or restricted. Make sure you eat enough as vegan diets tend to be lower in calories overall and you may need to eat more volume than you are used to. You will also need to supplement B12 and maybe other things depending on how you chose to eat.

The last thing I would say is to listen to your mind and your body. If you get any warning signs that you know are features of your ED, you will have to consider how you can move forward in a way that works for your mind, body and values. I care about animals and the environment, but first and foremost you have to take care of yourself and your wellbeing. You are the expert on yourself, and only you can really know whether you will be able to do this safely. If it feels wrong, dont do it. 

As a vegan I would like to say thank you for considering this lifestyle for the sake of animals and the planet, it is really kind and compassionate of you, but no one will blame you, or has any right to, for taking care of yourself first and foremost. If you decide to do it, monitor yourself closely, and if it looks like it could cause relapse.

Gotta have staples in the house though bc one thing I’ve found is nothing compares to high protein meal to prevent my binges, you gotta learn to cook and not be lazy, it’s harder if you grew up in a culture that didn’t teach you to cook veg. I’ve been on both sides, restriction and binges and veg and not. It’s about priorities.

Proud of you for thinking of yourself",pipandmerry,1578840048.0,2020-01-12 08:40:48,"In my opinion ""eating disorder"" is a bit of an outdated term, because the more you dive into ED related communities, the more you realize that everything you were taught about ""eating disorders"" growing up is way too over simplified, off putting, and not at all indicative of a real ED. Real people don't often fit into perfect little boxes of ""anorexic"" or ""binge"" or ""bulimia"" - real life isn't that convenient. 

My therapist once used the term ""unhealthy relationship with food"" and it really stuck with me. Sometimes I restrict, sometimes I binge, sometimes I don't do anything out of the ordinary with my diet, but my relationship with food is consistently wonky. 

It might help to explore ED support groups in your area. They typically welcome all people, whether or not you have a diagnosed disorder, and it can be so validating to have time set in your week to meet with people that have their own weird relationship with food. The group I attend will discuss difficulties such as the feelings of shame, the feelings of wanting to be healthy but fearing what being healthy actually means, how it can be hard to get back on track after you act on symptoms, and other relatable topics. But we don't talk about what actual symptoms are, because it doesn't matter whether you're restricting yourself to a specific degree or binging X amount or whatever, it's the fact that you think about food as toxic/addictive/negative, rather than viewing it as simple fuel for your body.

And just like the disorder is different for everyone, so is the recovery. I personally have to focus on the fact that my body is a tool - when I was young I always thought it was better to be weak and dainty, so I've had to flip that script on myself and work to make my body a tool that I can use. I rock climb, hike, do yoga, and go trail running to remind myself of the value of a strong, well fueled body. I have a workout routine with proper rest days in between, and see a nutritionist to make sure that I'm getting enough calories and protein to make my body stronger and more capable. But this is not the solution for everyone - some people are triggered by exercise and numbers. The best advice I can give you is to really reflect on where these feelings come from (why is your self worth found in your weight, what perfect version of yourself are you trying to reach with these habits, or why do you feel unworthy of a healthy lifestyle?) and then try to find health and contentment in the opposite, which is something your therapist can also help you with.",misterrnobodyy,1578944171.0,2020-01-13 13:36:11,"Well, I'm not one to self-diagnose.

Honestly, I started digging around after I had ""bodychecks"" blow up, and I amassed over 10k followers on mine, and most people who are looking into that side of tumblr are already sick and are trying to find ways to harm themselves. That is on them. Before I went to the ED side of tumblr, I never saw a glimpse of the community, minus metaphorical whispers between others blogs I followed of it's existence.   


I feel like it has it's own weight to it when I say it, I've had 3 pretty popular blogs. A what was called ""quality"" blog, an ED blog, and a blog for bands. All by the time of deletion had at least 10k followers. Finding ED communities are a lot harder than people make it out to be unless someone is exposing themselves, or making it so that they're making it easier they are getting exposed. 

The truth is, if you put it in someone's head, chances are it was there to begin with. People who aren't developing EDs are shocked, put off, sometimes revolted, and saddened by posts that are common in ED communities, including recipes. Granted, yes, you may have given them a new idea, but you did not cause them to go down the road. Everyone has a choice to view ED social media, so keep that in mind. 

It can be hard to deal with, so I would talk to a counselor.

Where are the closest ED facilities (residential/PHP/IOP)? Even if they're in another state/country, it's helpful to know what your options are.

If you don't have resources available to you - and you're basically doing this on your own, know that recovery is possible that way too. There are resources online, and even free ones to help you work through it.

First step - figure out your why. Why are you done? Why do want the ED to be gone? Why have you been unable to give up the ED in the past and why are you ready to give it up now?

I have similar troubles with food, I find that I can occasionally try something new as part of either a small variation of something I know I can eat (e.g. add one item to the sandwich I usually get at subway), but it can take a lot of time to get used to it.

Another thing is you should try to understand what it is that makes you struggle with certain food. If for example your problem is the texture of, say, fruit and vegetables, you might get somewhere if you try a juice or a soup instead.

Difficulty swallowing in general tends to fall into the category of dysphagia (and a greater constellation of diagnoses), and it also seems as though there is a very powerful emotional component to your physiological symptoms. Having a disordered relationship with food is tough, in my opinion, because food is essentially what nourishes us, but on an individual level, it comes to symbolize so much more. So difficulties eating, or wanting to use food as a tool to help us accomplish something in our lives (changing our appearance, feeling successful, etc.), can manifest in very potent ways.

You are perceptive in spotting that this is something that affects your life in a negative way, and cheers to you for being open to asking for help. I'd say the best thing to do would be to reach out to the therapist you're currently seeing and ask if s/he would refer you to a specialist or, if it is practicable, work with you directly on this issue. I would definitely encourage you to talk about it with someone -- It's not uncommon for more unusual eating disorders or disordered habits to become more destructive over time or begin to incorporate an increasingly abusive practice with food in order to alter one's weight, resulting in a further downward cycle which becomes more and more difficult to get out of. When we fixate on food, the fixation can begin to take over our lives more and more.

My girlfriend is a stick and has to eat a high calorie, high protein diet because of a medical condition, but she is still tiny and bordering underweight.


I find I don't compare myself too much to her (unless I'm having a particularly bad day), but I can't speak for your girlfriend. 


I've recently been really open with my girlfriend about my ED and she asked similar things to what you are, about what I needed and how she could best be supportive. These are the things I told her. They may not be the same for your GF, but it might be a good place to start.


1. I asked her not to compare her size to mine in any scenario, because then I WILL start using her as thinspo, for sure.

2. It's okay to offer me food, but please don't be offended when I say no. 

3. On the back foot of that, please DO NOT force me to eat. That will just make the guilt worse. 

4. Lots of cuddles and love on my bad days. And if we aren't together, just a supportive text saying she believes in me. 

5. No guilt tripping for restrictive or purging behaviours. Just cuddles, support, and maybe a ""this sounds like a really rough time for you. Are you okay/ do you want to talk about it. 


There were some more little things, but they're the big ones. 


As you said your GF is pretty open about her ED, my biggest recommendation would be to simply ask her what she needs from you, both on good days and bad days and how she needs/wants you to react if she's engaging in ED behaviours. She's going to be the best and only person who can really tell you what she needs from you. If she says she needs nothing, be there for her, even on her bad days.


Having an ED and being the bigger girlfriend in a same sex relationship is hard, but with your openness and support, it will be easier for her.


Good luck with your GF.

If she has an ED, it comes (like most of the time) from underlying problems like depression, stress, lack of a controlled environment, psychological and/or physical abuse, ... and those things won't be helped by living her life like she does.

I presume therapy is no option at the moment since her parents have no clue about parenting and she is too young/poor to pay for it herself. 

Try connecting as much as you can with her, find out how bad things actually are, and once she trusts you enough you may start helping her out with some of these problems. Maybe arrange for her to see a therapist if she likes and you can spare the money.

Be honest about it. If he is as supportive as you say, he won't hold your ED against you and he just wants to be there during the process. It seems like you can talk about it openly so don't go out of your way to purge in secret. It may hurt him more to know you're not honest to him than for him to see his advice isn't working per se.

Make clear he understands where your problem comes from (if you know this yourself off course) and that he in noway triggers it or you purging is in no way shape or form by something that he says or could be prevented by him doing or saying something. It's very easy for a partner to think they are part of the problem.

Take all the necessary steps to recovery, not only for yourself but also to prove to your partner that there is light at the end of the tunnel (because it's hard for you obviously, but also hard for him). So find professional help, stick to it, and if you feel comfortable enough also talk about what was being discussed in the therapy.

some very general advice there, but I believe those are the most important things. Honesty, an understanding of the facts and the proof that things may be getting better and you want it to become better.

If you feel it becoming a burdon on the relationship, try couples therapy, we never did it because I didn't feel we need it, but just discuss it with him to see how he feels.

443,eug5hq,the_scientist52,1580090562.0,2020-01-26 20:02:42,"I think it’s a tough situation because if she’s really wanting to try for kids, she might be tempted to lie and pretend that things are better so that you’ll be willing to try.  I also know that something that comes across as a threat/ultimatum can make the person defensive and ruin trust.  
So, when speaking to her about it, I think you should be careful about how you phrase your thoughts.

With that said, I personally don’t think you’re wrong.  Others might disagree with me but I’m of the opinion that a person should ideally be in stable recovery before having children.  It’s for the sake of the parents, since the stress of children can exacerbate ED behaviors.  It’s also for the sake of the children because witnessing disordered behaviors can be damaging for them.  Plus, while I think a person can still deeply love their children and be a good parent with an ED, someone in stable recovery will be able to be more present in relationships and that’s important.  

A lot of people get stuck thinking that their state of quasi-recovery is the best it will get.  I understand being very happy with making progress, and I’m sure your wife is proud of herself—as she should be!  But so many people stop 75% of the way there and don’t push themselves harder to reach a full recovery.  Which leads to them either staying that way and never living a full life, or slipping deeper into the ED again as relapses are more common when a person hasn’t yet reached behavioral stability.  

I guess what I’m saying is that I do think it’s worth it for your wife to seek treatment and see if things can get better for her.  Maybe they can’t, but she won’t know if she won’t try.  And your future children are yours just as much as they’re hers, and you deserve to feel comfortable bringing them into the world.  If you don’t, it’s worth a conversation.  Just be gentle and open to hearing her point of view.  Rather than giving an ultimatum, explain your reasoning and see if you both can come to an agreement about where to go from here.",invisiblepourlesyeux,1580090659.0,2020-01-26 20:04:19,"Totally not wrong.

I am fascinated by your comment that it is commonplace to stop ~75% of the way there. I did not realize this and am curious what the theories are to explain this. For EtOH, there is no 75%; either one is in recovery or not. I recognize that EDs are inherently different - one cannot abstain from food.

I’m now 24 weeks and am struggling to get support, it’s really difficult and I expect that probably once I’ve had this baby that my symptoms will likely get worse.

Stopping at 75% allows someone to hang on to a small piece of the ED so that they can still use it when life gets too intense. Plus, stopping at 75% usually gets you into the healthy-ish category where you’re not meeting full diagnostic criteria anymore. Examples would be someone who is at a healthy-ish weight but has to be rigid with food rules in order to maintain it; occasionally using symptoms (bingeing, purging, exercise, restricting, etc) when emotions run high; or still letting your overworth be dictated by weight/food. 
For many, motivation for recovery is ambivalent at best. Ask anyone with an ED and they’ll be identify all the good things their ED has given them. Sure there are negative consequences as well, but the positive side effects are typically what keep people stuck in the ED for as long as they are. There’s often a desire to recover enough to decrease the negative side effects while maintaining the positive ones, but recovery doesn’t work that way. In order to fully recovery, you have to give up both the good and bad things about the ED and many people aren’t ready/willing to do that.",pedismd,1580121747.0,2020-01-27 04:42:27,"You're totally right.

I know she believes this, but I also know that one binge / purge during pregnancy could set off the ultimate toxic shame cycle.

What I am hearing from you is that, even if she were in fully recovery, her statement that she is “not worried” would lack a degree of insight.

I have three children, a long history of eating disorders and with every pregnancy I struggled a bit. The worst part was honestly the post-partum period, when you are dealing with a ""new"" body you are not familiar with (plus all the hormones out of balance). Even one binge and purge is not good. What if she had morning sickness? She would be vomiting without aid, and that coupled with the odd relapse purge, *could* be harmful to the baby. IMO it would be wiser to go back to therapy to get to the heart of the relapse behaviours. Having a baby, (especially being first time parents!), is stressful.

It’s totally understandable to have an increase in thoughts from time to time, and if you’re not able to figure it out on your own it’s okay to go back to therapy. Sometimes we’ve worked on a lot of our stuff but as time goes by unresolved things tend to pop up (speaking from experience). 

Try going back to basics - what helped you when you were first trying to recover? What helped you pull yourself out of it the first time? Sometimes when we’ve been doing so well for so long it can be easy to forget or neglect those basic things.",oliviared52,1580064213.0,2020-01-26 12:43:33,"I had the same thing as you as far as my eating disorder is concerned. Been recovered for over 3 years and sometimes thoughts do come back. I think it’s important to remember that recovery isn’t a straight sloped upward line (like if looking at a graph it isn’t straight heading upward. It has a lot of curves and dips). But what’s important is you are much better than you were. So this may be a dip, but you are still overall heading up (if that makes sense lol)

I think it’s really good you can recognize these thoughts and feelings. And it’s even better you have a therapist to talk to. What keeps me away from purging again is I think about how it took my body YEARS to know when it was full or not and what a normal amount to eat is after binging and purging for so long. And to start purging again, my body would have to start all over again to learn what a normal amount to eat is. 

I’m really proud of you for noticing these thoughts. It is discouraging to feel fine for so long then have the thoughts come back. But this is a part of recovery. It’s a good reminder we can never stop working on ourselves.

I’ve been struggling with textbook anorexia for the last eight months or so and I’m finally on my road to recovery after losing 90 pounds in 8 months, however it wasn’t truly acknowledged by anyone, including doctors and my family, until I had a seizure. When I had a seizure I was 130 pounds and 5 foot two, well within a healthy rate range for my height. Unfortunately the more important side of it, the health of my organ system, is severely compromised as my heart arrhythmia, extreme malnutrition &amp; vitamin deficiency had no significant visible symptoms to go along with them. Often times it’s the people within a healthy weight range that have more internal damage than many underweight people with anorexia because it was ignored for so long or not taken seriously in people who appeared “healthy”. I’m disappointed that it took a seizure for people to actually look into my rapid weight loss and declining mental health but that’s far too common in health professionals everywhere. Good for you for speaking up about it, I’m so sorry that you feel like they’re not taking you seriously, if you’re over the age of 18 there are many clinics that will allow you to go and talk to people that specialize in every type of eating disorder and understand how mentally draining it is to have one, let alone one that’s not taken seriously by other medical professionals.

Then, at 29 I ate half a box of girl scout cookies and felt guilty so I purged--just this one time I told myself. 15 years and it didn't let up. On top of that, depression and alcohol abuse set in. Finally, after everything started spiraling I got myself checked into an eating disorder clinic at the age of 46. It was the best move I've ever made. I also realized that after 3 horrible therapists who didn't understand eating disorders, it was essential to get that level of expertise. I don't know what advice is better than seeking therapy from an eating disorder specialist and if that isn't possible, I would seek out an addiction specialist. I get the stigma families can attach to mental health, but at the end of the day, this is your life. I have had to educate my family and train them about the disorder AND how to honor triggers. I learned that this disorder is a relentless beast always lurking and my guard can never be down. I share this with you, and others, to understand the longevity of this disorder.

The thing is poor diet and an eating disorder is different, but maybe talking to a therapist about how to approach this situation so it's best for you? Cus it's important you dont back track yknow? Its wonderful you're aware, so that's awesome. But idk what stuff you're talking about with him either so I cant really say with him either. In my experience, just peoples poor diet habits were triggering in themselves, they didnt have an ED and weren't even on their way to one, but it did kinda stick with me and sometimes I DID go back to old habits myself. So maybe an appointment with a therapist just to be like ""yo, how do I approach this situation in a healthy and good way without crossing boundaries?""",houston_veronica,1580578520.0,2020-02-01 11:35:20,"Does he - in your opinion - have a weight loss need...as in, did his dr mention it could help him?  

The thing is: even if the answer is 'no' - EVERYONE in this world has the right to do what they need to do to feel good in their own skin. When and if it becomes an ED is completely individual, and may never happen. It's impossible to police what others do, esp. when you are trying to open your heart to getting out of the ED bubble and into the real world. 

If it were me, I would challenge myself to do ""opposite"" thinking around anyone triggering.  Every time you think ""but but, I want to lose weight! I want to do that too!"" -- think: ""I am different. My past proves that I am not able to lose weight responsibly. This person does not have my past. I need to pay attention to my own medical ""prescription"".  

Repeating that thought EVERY time, you will learn to ice out any temptations to follow what others do.  

Remember: you are different than him, and even if he does things that are ED-esque, it doesn't allow you to preach to him or project. My counselors told me this, and it is true: pay attention to your own plate. Don't look at what others eat or do.  It's none of our business where they are in their journey of life and self-discovery. (And: Think of how many people we have inadvertently triggered. I get depressed thinking of how many I myself could have affected with my clear anorexia, and lament that daily.)",the_scientist52,1580578551.0,2020-02-01 11:35:51,"You definitely have to talk to him.  There's a way to do it without being confrontational--tell him that it's something you're struggling with and you want to figure out a way for both of you to feel comfortable/okay.  I don't know the details of the situation, but I have a family member who's always on again, off again dieting.  The boundary I set was that I wasn't going to try to change what she was doing, but I would appreciate if she didn't talk about it or draw attention to it with me.  I can't say she's followed through all that well but in theory that was a good line for me to draw because I wasn't forcing someone to not diet but I was reducing my own exposure to it.  Again, I'm not sure exactly what your boyfriend is doing or if something like that could apply, but I think there are always potential compromises where you can protect yourself without being overbearing on him.

In addition, you could also just directly say that you're concerned about his behaviors and make sure he's okay.  A person can be without an ED but still have habits that are harmful to their body.  As ED sufferers we have a lot of knowledge about nutrition, exercise, and eating habits--we know what's healthy and what isn't, often more than a typical person who's been raised in diet culture.  So there's always the option to try to educate.  Maybe he just doesn't realize that there could be healthier ways to go about what he's trying to do, or that he doesn't need to be trying to do it at all. 

So there are a few options of what to do depending on your comfort level and the details of the situation.  But in my opinion, the bottom line is that you need to talk to him one way or another.  We can't avoid all triggers or concerning things but we're also allowed to try to minimize them when possible, and I think that applies to serious romantic relationships especially because they're a big part of our lives.",stpfah,1580580709.0,2020-02-01 12:11:49,"Yep!  Diet culture is here and not going anywhere soon.  My mom's family is ALWAYS dieting on whatever the latest fad is. My dad is all about restriction and obsessively works out. It regularly comes up in chats among friends.  It's so annoying!

I'm not trying to say it doesn't have an effect on me, because it does.  But if I take the time to think about it, I can come back to the fact that I don't have to live that way anymore, and because of my mental health I can't live that way anymore.

In my experience setting boundaries early in a relationship sets a great foundation for communication and connection.

455,ewmo01,the_scientist52,1580490425.0,2020-01-31 11:07:05,"There are a few reasons why she might not be discussing her illness as much.  Maybe she’s just not doing well, or conversely, she could be working really hard to make her ED less of a focus in her life/friendships.  Perhaps as she went along in the program, she started to feel more comfortable using the patients/staff for ED-specific support.  She might also just really miss being out in the world with her friends and is interested in keeping up with your life!  

Whatever the reason, it’s still perfectly okay to ask the things you’re wanting to know.  I’d suggest asking in general how things are going and then saying something like “It’s totally okay if you don’t know your plans yet, and I don’t want you to feel pressured, but I’ve been thinking about how much I’d like to support you when you leave treatment because I know that can be hard.  Either now or when the time comes, could you tell me some ways I can help you with the transition?” 

I personally don’t think there’s anything wrong with directly asking if she’s planning to stay with you and when that might be.  But if you don’t feel comfortable with that, I’d suggest wording it as I did above.  That way, she might simply just provide the info you’re looking for, but she also has the option to not discuss it if she doesn’t want to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am not nor have I ever been in your situation but I have a suggestion... have you tried imcreasing estrogen via natural food sources? Like some soy, and other food sources that “mimick” estrogen? Weight training will likely reduce estrogen or maybe increase testosterone. I’m not an expert, but before taking any meds at all, I’d research ways to 1) increase estrogen naturally and 2) decrease testosterone if your doctor is saying this might be the reason. Only after you’re unsuccessful would I try other things. Worst case, you’ll find out more about how your body reacts to foods that can cause hormonal fluctuations! 

Congrats on getting from a low point in your disorder to this much healthier point... for all those who can’t see the light... yours is a good example of how things CAN get better, even if they aren’t perfect.

460,f26jgw,tsar_monty,1581435911.0,2020-02-11 09:45:11,"There's a complex connection between sports and eating disorders. It's such a tricky place to be, even for someone not dealing with disordered eating at all, let alone someone who is struggling.

The hard part is that sports and exercise is inherently a great thing. There's so much good, not just from a physical health perspective, but also from a teamwork, social and achievement perspective.

With that said, sports are competitive, no matter what it is. My sport is cycling, and competition very much so comes with the territory. Weight is also a huge factor for a lot of competitive cyclists, and it played perfectly into my disordered thinking when I was down in the trenches with my disorder. 

I remember I really started getting serious about winning races when I was near my lowest weight a couple years ago. I was training super hard, and restricted my diet even more in pursuit of being leaner and thinner so I could go faster and perform better. What a lie that was. I wasn't winning because I didn't have any energy – I wasn't fueled right and my body was screaming at me to stop. I didn't see it that way, though. I just thought ""if I just train harder and control my diet a bit more, I'll win."" I didn't see my disordered thinking, which took up a huge amount of my mental space, and my dangerously low weight as problems that prevented me from being good at something I love.

It takes a lot of time, therapy and deep digging to know that when you treat your body right, nourish it and control the anxiety and fear around food, you'll not only feel 100x better, but you will get better in your sport.

You might want to swap over from calorie counting to a dietary exchange approach. Instead of counting strict calories, you use a less structured approach but it all averages out in the end. Its a good way to keep variety in your diet and it makes estimating amounts for dinners out or non-planned meal items a lot easier. 

Part of long term recovery for many AN diagnosed involves overshooting your ""ideal BMI"" by a little bit and then coming back down with less structure in your diet. Folks that hover along at the low end of their BMI seem to perpetually be at higher risk of relapse/sudden drops.

You might also keep some sport drinks or Ensure type beverages on hand. For times when you just can't eat, you might be able to pop the lid on an 8oz bottle and toss it back.

Suggestion: keep that spirit of reaching out. Find a therapist trained in ED and a dietician specialized in ED.  They will help you identify and practice healthy coping strategies and healthy eating strategies, respectively.

I personally would recommend talking to a counsellor about this yourself. It might seem odd because your daughter is the one with the illness, but talking to a professional who can hear more at length about how your daughters been struggling, the home dynamic, whats worked/not worked, and other details would hopefully give that person a better foundation to give helpful advice. 

If affordability is an issue (is for most people) there are many free or sliding scale options, and hopefully some in your area. Your daughters treatment support/or team may be helpful to get advice and support from as well. Also if there are any eating disorder clinics/programs/specialists in your area those might be the first places I would check out.

Also, distraction.  Watch movies, youtube, play boardgames, make crafts, call Grandma, plant seeds, clean the bathroom, ANYTHING that is sedentary or close to it.

For many weeks she was so upset and out of sorts that all she’d do was sulk and grump, watching tv with headphones on was her preferred activity. But things have improved a bit now and we try to do things together several nights a week and have been able to slowly introduce some exercise (she’s in gymnastics) but with appropriate measures taken in her new plan.

How did you determine when OK to reintroduce exercise?

To OP, if your daughter has been at low BMI for a longish time, some AN recovery patients will become hypermetabolic when they start eating again. Just sitting there they bleed off as heat a ton of the calories they ingest. Calorie loads that would make an average person overweight in a few weeks will barely be enough to put any weight on someone who's hypermetabolic. Exercising in this state can require literally multiples of the calories they might need at rest, making it impossible to regain much weight at all. 

Video games, TV, books, crafts, anything to keep her from moving around too much.",MathyMama,1581090610.0,2020-02-07 09:50:10,"My daughter was in a partial hospitalization program. She had gone from many many hours of gymnastics (along with this secret monster AN) to being in a totally different environment. We were living at a Ronald McDonald House, so we were away from the gymnastics equipment for a long time. As she became weight restored and feeling better, the therapists approved a return. Her coach is VERY in tune with the situation and also monitoring everything with us very carefully. Her dieticians adapted her daily meal plan to allow for a certain number of hours a week, and she knows she has to maintain in order to continue. For her the complete drop off in physical activity was necessary but also very hard emotionally..,I’m trying to balance wanting her to stay connected to activities and people she love and feeling GOOD in her body versus any possible triggers and return to disordered eating and exercise.",16of16,1581095863.0,2020-02-07 11:17:43,"My son went in patient a few months ago, his recovery has been very rapid compared to most and is now at about 80th percentile BMI. There is no real concern about his weight but plenty that a return to any regular training might cause all sorts of problems to resurface.

 He wasn't really using exercise as a coping method in terms of calories out - it was never enough weekly volume to make a big difference, but it did become something he lost control over somewhat - constantly doing ab exercises. There is fear it could fuel body image and sports performance issues that could make him want to lean down again. 

They don't mind sports activity so much as working out at home - needs to be part of a team environment if possible, he used to be into swimming. ED turns everything on its head, the best sports for him now are contact ones where more mass improves performance and body is covered in layers of protective gear and baggy uniforms - exactly the type of sports that are liable to get him bonked in the head.

Still not sure how to approach that, a martial art with limited contact might be a better choice.",MathyMama,1581098304.0,2020-02-07 11:58:24,"My daughters weight recovery was rapid too! I attribute that to the sharp drop off in activity along with the meal planning. We have to tackle ARFID and she’s been backsliding on some of those issues. Being in gymnastics is not ideal for ED recovery given the focus on physical appearance...we have also just enrolled her in a horse riding therapy program. My hope is it helps her connect to her body without all of the baggage of gymnastics. She currently does gymnastics once a week, limited (very little) workout at home. She had been working something like 12 hours a week at the gym and maybe 10+ more per week at home.

We actually cut off his exercise and swimming because he didn't keep his weight up, and that unfortunately allowed him to rationalize an increase in his purging from seldom to frequent, precipitating a medical emergency one month after his last pediatrician eval. 

When he first went into treatment he went ballistic, personality almost unrecognizable. I don't think staff gave us very good odds at succeeding, but he really is motivated to get his liberty back. I'm afraid now if we don't allow him to get some exercise after he's worked so hard he's going to stop cooperating.

I have a friend who opened up to me about sexual assault and I just wanna tell him “ please get help if you don’t you’ll end up like me” using unhealthy coping mechanisms mine is eating but anyone who undergoes trauma risks using something to cope. I’m really sorry this happened to you I understand this all to well. Please get help you deserve to be free and also know what happened isn’t your fault and there are really good people in this world even though we have seen the really bad ones. I promise you getting help is worth it. Also my therapist wants me to see a real doctor to figure out health issues I have similar ones as you as well I really hope you can be healthy no matter what!!,lwaikart,1581013406.0,2020-02-06 12:23:26,"First- I’m sorry you’re in the midst of all this. From the trauma, to the feelings of shame and guilt, to the feeling out of control unless you’re are in control and the questioning of your own fault in this.
Eating disorders are incredibly complex and there is no one size fits all presentation. I think over-exercising is probably one of the more common ED behaviors that isn’t necessarily seen as a behavior. Unlike vomiting or even skipping meals, exercise is almost universally considered a positive thing. People will praise the crap out of you for your willpower and dedication and persistence. Exercising is seen as a worthwhile and noble pursuit which means if you use it unhealthily you can slide down the slope for a long time before anyone sees the potential drawback. And since weight loss can be a side effect of increased exercise, it wouldn’t raise suspicion the way skipping meals might. But- it’s also worthwhile bringing it up with close friends/family. Some likely didn’t notice. Some did notice but didn’t think anything was wrong. Maybe a few suspected but weren’t sure what to say.

You said yourself that your mom was always on/off diets so there’s a chance she had some low level (or high level who knows) disordered eating behaviors and your sister had AN. EDs have a genetic component. You were already primed and the trauma was the trigger that overwhelmed your system, and sent it looking for whatever coping strategies fit best. When it comes to EDs though, exercise is just another behavior that helps you cope with whatever emotion you’re trying to run away from. In order to heal the ED you will need to address the trauma and subsequent anxiety. But thats a good thing. 
And yes, of course it’s possible that there’s something else going on. But the only way to know if it’s an ED or something else would be to stop the ED behaviors and see if your weight is still wonky. I’d guess doing that would probably up your anxiety/panic thus suggesting that the ED is the most likely culprit.",16of16,1581015880.0,2020-02-06 13:04:40,"I'd say be very careful. Once your BMI drops enough you'll no longer be thinking straight. Food restriction then becomes ""therapeutic"" - it is effective at dulling mental/emotional pain and trauma and it becomes increasingly difficult to separate out from other issues as they all get twined up into a big ball.

If exercise is a major form of therapy for you, don't be arbitrary about your BMI. Make sure its not at the low end of the percentile curve. Pick a healthy value and stick to it. Be a little more structured in your diet if you have to, make sure it doesn't drop below a healthy minimum. It goes w/out saying you are at increased risk and some of this is just plain genetic. Also, stick more to strength building and stay away from longer sessions of metabolic conditioning/bootcamp type workouts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I say this as my son spiraled into a bad pattern and is now in recovery. He wasn't transitioning off of meds, but when he got into recovery a whole lot of pain was unleashed that maybe should have been medically addressed that he gradually self-medicated with food restriction. 

Some of it might have come just from getting his nutrition back into a healthy balance - he wasn't malnourished for very long but it was a short, deep dive to a BMI of &lt; 14. His personality in recovery was almost 100% unrecognizable and even now several months in he is a very different person in so many ways.

I tried repeatedly to get him to a healthier diet when we realized his weight was dropping, and he was following a solid meal plan, but also purging - which we didn't realize or maybe want to believe at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR you are at increased risk for a couple of reasons and exercise is a major coping strategy/gateway behavior to a more serious problem. Keep some extra weight on them bones as an insurance policy.",R0ck01,1581045470.0,2020-02-06 21:17:50,"I've been struggling with purging disorder AND other illness nausea. Nausea itself is a stress reaction for me but also, when I haven't felt the nausea I have felt the urge to purge.

It's the feeling to control. For most cases and definitely for me. Regarding past trauma and just life going on in general.

I've never been one to do stuff like that for weight loss or weight gain though. So in a way, it's a layer I don't have to deal with in that sense. Even though I do stress about my weight and physical issues... I just don't see purging or other stuff like that as a means to lose weight. But my mind sees it as a way to ""cleanse"" myself. To self soothe. To fix things that have nothing to do with it. To feel a sense of control. 

Self destruction can feel soothing as in ""well another may hurt me and I can't control it but I can control how I hurt myself so I have some power"". 

Your next step could be a local or online support group. And seeing a specialist. A dietitian in conjunction with that would be a good combination. 

Before I started cutting, purging, and overdosing pills, I did think that only certain people resort to that and it wouldn't be me. But when I first tried it, I felt like I gained an independence, an action that met the self loathing that I had been missing.

I come on this reddit from time to time mostly for inspiration and to remind myself that a lot of people are going through this. I don't normally post a response but the way you described your relationship to exercise made me think I might do some small good (I don't have ED but I DO use exercise as a primary coping strategy).

A few things I might add based on what I have learned since this happened - do some reading of current treatment literature, everything you can get your hands on. Treat this like any other chronic illness or injury, reduce some of the mental anguish associated with it being an unknown. How ED, especially anorexia, is treated has changed a lot in the last 10-15 years, shifting from a psychoanalytical approach to more of a ""treat the symptom"" approach has made it a lot less ""mysterious"" if that's the right word. 

Starvation is the illness, food is the medicine, consistency over time is the cure. Therapy can be an important component for identifying underlying issues triggering the ED, but it isn't the only one. The ED might be a coping mechanism, an accidental dip in nutrition that creates a malfunction in the brain's reward response mechanism, etc etc. Finding a good therapist is not easy, my son has an adversarial relationship with just about everyone on his medical ""team"" but is making good progress.

They kept telling me in the program ""you can't reason with an ED, its not a rational illness"". Many of the people I have talked to through support group that have recovered long term all agreed that a period of overfeeding was what put them over the top, they had to let it go long enough put on a little bodyfat and then come back down to a healthier autoregulated diet/bodyweight. The ""Minnesota Experiment"" research isn't about ED but it has a lot of insight into how the undernourished mind and metabolism function, and is well worth a quick read. 

Support group meetings can be a great resource, don't be afraid to look into that avenue. There are people who have beat this, or have kids that have beat this and it can be a real help just to sit there and listen. I cannot imagine being an adult with this illness but I would think support group would be high on my list of resources.

And having kids is not rocket science, although it is a ton of work. Sucks when things go poorly for them but we all take our knocks and carry our baggage, and hopefully are better for it at the end of the day. Best of luck to you.",lwaikart,1581137136.0,2020-02-07 22:45:36,"Glad you’re getting help OP. You have a month- you can use it to explore why you want the treatment. Why you want to give up the ED. What it’s taken away from you or what it threatens to take away. If you show up to treatment really motivated for change you’re treatment trajectory will likely be quicker than if you show up still questioning whether you want change. Of course there will be hard days and days where your motivation falters, but you at least could skip the hump of pushing back against recovery.",pizza_bath,1581204025.0,2020-02-08 17:20:25,"You raise a really important point - I could be making this more complicated than it needs to be right now. The Minnesota experiment is pretty compelling, and found some work on inducing 'activity-based anorexia' in rodents from listening to Tabitha Farrar's podcast that made me feel like it doesn't necessarily need to be 'that deep'. My training is in biology, so I might know too much about the 'greyness' of evolutionary psychology explanations for human behaviour to take a lot of comfort in them, but the idea that there was likely a predisposition and therefore some amount of biological inevitability for this pattern in me doesn't seem that unreasonable, and I think you're right that my focus should be in getting fed enough to think clearly before trying to really understand triggers (which I do think will be key for long term success for me).

best of luck to you too &lt;3",pizza_bath,1581204813.0,2020-02-08 17:33:33,"That's a great game plan. 

I guess my main source of hesitation right now is that without seeing the psychiatrist I don't have a diagnosis, I have a campus clinic GP writing ""GAD, ED? Please see"" on a referral form, so I don't know 'how bad i have it' and therefore what my approach should be. If these are less entrenched disordered thoughts that don't merit a diagnosis, am I safe with a more intuitive eating approach, or should I be forcing food in?

I'm sure this is partly me not wanting to gain weight and somehow convincing myself 'maybe they'll tell you you caught it early enough and they'll hand you a meal plan that puts you at maintenance calories so you gain zero weight'.....seems very likely haha

I guess I feel lost about how much to eat right now. I'm eating consistently to fullness, and am hesitant to go back to tracking my intake for fear of trying to push it too low once I see the numbers. I never skipped any meals or cut any food groups, but I bulked my meals up with alot of veggies and had become very focused on eating foods that were highly satiating, so I'm trying to switch these out for more starchy carbs and fats. Any other resources/tips welcome!",lwaikart,1581247580.0,2020-02-09 05:26:20,"The meal plan itself is definitely a challenging part which is why regular appointments with a dietician is part of standard ED treatment. I’m not an RD so it would be out of my depth to be able to suggest your meal stuff. What you can do is continue to eat to fullness, avoid restricting, honor hunger etc. You can also get a sense if there are certain foods that you do avoid and try to challenge yourself to include them. If you typically order an egg white omelette with veggies at brunch, see what it’s like if you try adding toast or pancake to the meal. Push yourself to have a few more bites than what you find comfortable. If tracking brings on too many obsessive thoughts, I’d say you’re right to not engage in that unless your have a professional helping you do it.
Eating disorder treatment in general is going to be about noticing where the boundaries of your comfort zone are and then repeatedly pushing yourself outside those bounds (in a caring and supportive manner with people around you encouraging you). If you can start some of that work now, you’ll be better for it. You don’t need a specific diagnosis to do that kind of work (and frankly everyone, with or without an official diagnosis if anything should do the same).
Intuitive eating is an awesome approach to food/eating, but even the authors of the original book note that if you are anywhere near the range of an ED, that approach is not right for you (yet). When you’re in the midst of an ED,  it can be hard to differentiate YOUR thoughts from the ED thoughts. So if you find yourself thinking oooo I could totally go for a refreshing salad right now, it’s a challenge to differentiate whether your ED is saying that because salads feel safe or your body is craving it. Typically there’s such a distancing between head and body in an ED that it’s basically impossible to know what your body wants. 
I do want to commend you for your approach to all this. It’s a very weird experience to realize that you can trust everything that goes on in your brain and to forcibly challenge what your head/body seem to communicate. You’re already starting to question the validity of the thoughts you’re having which is awesome. Keep doing that. You can also go down the “so what” trail. If you start treatment and they don’t out you on a maintenance meal plan, so what? If they tell you that you need to gain Xlbs, so what? If they tell you that you have a mild/severe ED, so what? And I don’t mean this in a flippant way- I mean, really, what would it mean for you if that situation was the case? Why would it matter to you? What would it mean about you? Etc etc.

Good luck, let me know if you have other questions about the process.",pizza_bath,1581353247.0,2020-02-10 10:47:27,"Agh thank you thank you - I'm so grateful to live in a time where this type of thing exists and selfless people like you are able to provide support.

It's good to hear that your family is striving for justice over your grandma and on top of that, hopefully that would help other patients. A lot of nursing homes are know to let preventable bedsores occur (I don't know if that was the issue with your grandma). 

That's horrible that your treatment center pretty much abandoned you without a more structured and urgent transition plan. 

That's very good that you're aware and willing to put in the healing while listening to guidance... some never do... yet that can fuck up with trust when you put yourself out there and those in charge don't follow through. Please don't give up. I hope you don't use it against you.... 

Did the rehab give you any local eating disorder meeting locations close by? Depending on how far and the scheduling, you could get to those quicker than the 8 weeks long wait for the DBT therapy. Heck, even meetings(they have to be labled ""open"" if 12 step) that may not be specified to your issues (like a.a.) but still provide an environment that has something in common: they try to help dig into what is underneath our unhealthy habits. So for example, I'm not an alcoholic. But due to transport and lack of enough meetings that cater specifically to my specific additions, I go to a lot of ""open"" aa meetings. Yeah it's a little uncomfortable and it can make some people think I'm an alcoholic in denial but I've recieved far more out of it than negative because I'm open to what's underneath. We all have disordered thoughts. And I've met people who have the same addictions I have that aren't alcohol. It's something to consider. But be careful. There are predator personalities that go to things like that... 

It truly is sad. That some people miss out on otherwise accessible care because it takes so long to schedule...

I understand the anxiety. 

If you're too afraid to talk, you can just come in there, grab some free coffee and sit down and not speak. There will probably be people who come say hi at the end of before the meeting though to welcome you and get your name! 

And eventually(week, months, years down the line), some people may try to encourage you to speak during the meeting. But you don't have to. 

And people conversate before and after the meeting at the locations. Sometimes that's perfect for those that are shy. But then again, if one is more shy to speak in discussion one on one then speaking indirectly to a whole room may feel more comfortable.

The talking directly to people before or after the meeting or getting phone numbers may connect you to those that have eating disorders too. Just be careful. Some people prey. Some people are just in such an unstable mindset that they're easily codependent or could turn into a ""relapse buddy"".

Stress can cause high acid in the stomach and make you feel sick. I was prescribed antacids for something similar and it helped a lot.

It isn’t worth the risk at all.",the_scientist52,1583337062.0,2020-03-04 09:51:02,"In my experience, a higher level of care has always been recommended when I've been unable to stop using behaviors on my own.  Not necessarily at the first sign of a relapse, but after a certain amount of time it's always become clear that I won't be able to make changes without more help.",wendy125,1583345582.0,2020-03-04 12:13:02,"My daughter has been inpatient 3 times.  I agree with the others that sooner is better.  I have a couple of other views as well.  A responsible therapist will always recommend a higher level of care of they feel you are not making progress, or are getting worse.  

In treatment you will most likely gain weight.  It is not a sure thing though.  The patient HAS to want to get better.  They can be monitored, tube fed, whatever, but if they truly don't want to get better (and this is pretty common), they won't make a lot of progress toward recovery.  

One of the really good things about treatment is that the staff is usually very knowledgable about EDs and are up on the latest treatments and studies.  We have found that typically a provider not in a treatment setting may be a great provider, but doesn't usually have the expertise of those in treatment.  

Treatment facilities also seem to have a way to tap into the competitive side of the eating disorder and patients may try to be the sickest patient.  There is almost always someone sicker and the ED turns that around and makes the patient think they are not sick enough for treatment.  Patients also learn really bad behaviors from each other.  For example, my daughter did not self harm until she went into treatment.  The competition is real.

Lastly, ERC Denver is very, very good.  They do a great job of educating the patient's family and loved ones.  We didn't know this prior to our arrival in Colorado, but it is good to know that a provider in Colorado can hold a patient against their will if they believe the patient is not well enough to make good decisions for themselves.  It sounds harsh, but it was what worked for my very strong-willed daughter.  She was over 18 and could sign herself out (Which she absolutely would have done), but her weight was so low they were able to place her under a hold and keep her.  

Being in a treatment facility will not be fun, but it may be exactly what you need.  Best of luck to you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, I don't think 55-60 is very low. I am nearly 40 years old and currently low-normal weight, I hover around the normal weight/underweight line. I train 6-7 days a week for 2-3 hours at a time. 

When I've been severely bulimic/restricting, my resting heart rate has been as low as 38-40. Last time i had an operation they wouldn't let me leave recovery because the 'bradycardia' machine kept going off as my heart rate was dropping to 40ish.  In the end I convinced them it was normal for me.

55-60 sounds normal to me?",ftdaisy,1583232139.0,2020-03-03 04:42:19,How old are you? That’s not a dangerously low heart rate for someone who’s young and not overweight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
