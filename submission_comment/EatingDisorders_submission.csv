1,EDPostRequests,1609984515,ks2v7c,32,"So, I'll try to make this as brief as I can.  My daughter is 13, and very overweight.  I raised her as a single dad for most of her life, so I take full responsibility for her issues with food, as I have food issues, and am overweight myself.  In fact, the majority of my maternal family has food/weight issues.  They just say ""oh, we're just italian"". But that doesn't make it ok, for me.  

My daughter had been binge eating, I guess, and sneaking food.  Every time I turn around to get something to use for dinner or whatever, it's missing, or half the block of cheese is gone, or there's an empty container of something, with 1 left.  That's a trademark of hers.  Leaving 1 or 2 of whatever it is in the package.  Unfortunately, due to my work hours and her school hours, she is home for a little bit in the mornings and after school.  Maybe 2 hours combined.  I'm sure this is when she does most of it.

I'm well aware professional help is needed, and we've been to a few therapists, who just didn't seem to care, and didn't make any progress, so I'm searching for another now.  However, I know that can take a long time to get under control, so I'm terrified for her, for the time being.  I've considered getting cameras in the house, I've considered putting locks on the fridge and cabinets, but both of these options seem like they could cause more harm than good.  I don't know what to do to control it for now.

I gained some weight and lost my exercise routine over the course of COVID - I've been working at a hospital, it's been stressful. I've been aware of this, but have been optimistic that I'll be able to get back to a place where I feel comfortable sometime.

I have never done this before. I am so desperate to go back to my behaviors. Is there anything I can do to keep myself afloat until therapy? Is there anything I can do to avoid triggers?

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been with my girlfriend for 8 months now and we love each other very much, but early on into talking she made it clear that he’s has mental issues and has fought with her ED for over a couple years now. She went through a massive weight change since over a year ago and has lost a lot of pounds but i’d rather not mention anything because I don’t want it to be triggering to anyone here.

&amp;#x200B;

She was obsessed with working out, counting calories, and losing weight in an unhealthy way and some days today can be worse than others. Sometimes she just doesn’t want to eat at all, some she worries about the repercussions, some days she seems fine and will enjoy her meals with me when we go out but i’m assuming those thoughts are still in her head. I just don’t want to push her into doing anything she doesn’t and thankfully she’s very comfortable with telling me about it.

&amp;#x200B;

At times, she’ll have bad days. A few days at a time where the voice is constantly in her head. She’s more than a body and she’s beautiful inside and out no matter what as i keep reminding her, and I know she knows that her body isn’t different to what she may be thinking in the moment, or that i would judge her which i’d never. I just want to know if there are any other things I could tell her at times when it’s bad or randomly to make her feel better. I try my best to console her and it works a lot of the time but I just want whats best. Thank you guys for everything.

My title is : I hate myself. I have had enough of bulimia. Im scared I dont know what to do anymore. I need advice. 

Body : A little backstory about me and my condition. I started bulimia when i was 14 years old. I was a chubby kid, and i played basketball and my biggest issue was my weight, so I figured if I become bulimic i could get in shape and take my game to the next level, it worked. I was bulimic til I was 17 and it felt good, i had a-lot of attention from girls, i looked good, i felt good about it and i thought it was okay. But one day I looked at my teeth and I realized the damage that started to occur so I quit purging for 2 years, i had pearly whites and they were very yellow and started coroding. So i stopped for 2 years, it was tough, i went from 200lbs and in shape to being 260lbs and obese. I had everyone telling me basically how bad i looked at whether it was my friends, my doctor my family it was horrible but i fought threw it those 2 years. When i was 19 I started dating a very pretty girl that indirectly made me feel  so insecure about myself. So much so while  dating her i figured i have to become bulimic so i can look good for her and make her physically attracted to me and to be confident in myself, so it started. 

Throughout college i was bulimic and it got so bad at points that i would purge and have nothing in my system then drink and almost kill myself accidently from alcohol poisoning i started to feel random pains in my body and all that, my teeth are coroded to the point the bottoms of my teeth arent straight anymore they are uneven and i even had my tooth chip because they were so weak and i bit down on them too hard. I got told by a doctor when i have a fatty liver but never went back because i was scared to find out more. Anyways i had some very personal things happen to me that out me in a really bad spot, i started purging alot more to the point i wouldnt even let food digest i would instantly go to the bathroom and make myself throw up. I dropped from 230lbs to 185lbs i did catch covid aswell which may have contirbuted to a small part of my weight loss but nothing significant. I dont play sports havent for 4 years therefore even though i have lost alot of weight my body i am now  skinny fat which is even worse because atleast before i was pretty strong now i feel weak. I have been thinking of recovery for a couple years now but I am not ready for that weight gain. I am 24 and i feel like I have completely ruined my life and any chance of future happiness or confidence with myself. What doesnt help is im from a low class neighborhood some would consider the “hood” and the hyper masculinity in it doesnt help as if you ever talk about mental illness or an eating disorder people will look at you crazy and even gossip about you which is bad because i have no where to escape to about it 

So i had attempted 2 times to reach out to a doctor for help, and the response they would get is instant confusion as to me being bulimic almost as if i dont sort the criteria of what a bulimic looks like( i know there is no way there supposed to look but others ovbiously dont) which really had not helped my situation. I also have dont have friends who could help because i dont feel comfortable letting them know because i had gotten scarred when i told my ex and she left, i thought i could trust her with the world and she did me wrong when i let her know whats going on with me. I therefore dont have the coursge to go to a friend. 

I rambled a little but, My question to you guys is what should i do to recover? I cant stress enough how I really do not want to gain weight, in fact I am terrified about it! I know weight gain is normal but i know my weight gain will be very extreme and im not ready for that at all, i dont think i ever will be. Its hard knowing we live in such a superficial world where looks are everything, and the fact that i get alot of attention from women now and treated because my face has slimmed down and the rest of my body really doesn’t help. I want to get my life back together but i cant deal witht his weight gain that will happen i know myself im not okay with it. I tried researching online and a lot of the support groups or advice is aimed at women and not so much men which is good that somethings being done but its hard to even find someone that can relate to me or give me advice on recovery.

But since I have some weird things going on and haven't found anything similar, I thought I'd make a post and see if anyone could help, because I really really hope someone out there has relevant experiences.

**My situation:**

About 7 weeks ago I began having extreme symptoms of nausea and weakness. In a day or two of that I realised I'd been accidentally under-eating (and was therefore underweight) for at least the past two years. To be clear, I didn't have the mental side of anorexia, it apparently just happened that I under-ate for an extended period of time. I then got in touch with a dietician and we set up a plan to increase my food intake, and over the past 6.5 weeks I'm now nearing my target weight.

The problem is that my symptoms of nausea and extreme weakness (like I can barely get off the couch) haven't gone away in the slightest. I've also had a high heart rate, night sweats, chills, extreme trouble sleeping, and hot flashes. I had gastroparesis and GERD, but in general haven't had many stomach pains; really the main issue is this **simply debilitating level of nausea and weakness to the point where it's hard to talk** -- it's of course affecting my ability to get the required amount of food. Also, I cannot eat fast enough to have separate meals. My whole day just ends up being one long meal. Doctors have suggested that some of my symptoms match those of POTS, or maybe inappropriate sinus tachycardia. I'm going to be getting a tilt table test done soon to further investigate that. I've also had other tests done to see if something else may be going on -- nothing has come up yet but doctors say there is clearly some degree of inflammation (whether that's due to chronic sleep deprivation or something else is unclear right now).

My main concern is whether I should really expect this level of continued nausea and weakness at this point in the recovery. I read about people being able to do dishes and go for a walk at this point in the recovery process, but I'm just not anywhere near that yet and that's kind of freaking me out. I had a couple of really good days 2 weeks ago, but now I feel like I did at the beginning of this all. 

Has anyone else experienced similar stuff? I'm going to doctors and dieticians and all so they'll hopefully figure it out, but I really am just wondering **if anyone out there has had similar experiences**.

15,EDPostRequests,1609844248,kqw7rg,4,"Hi all,

I’m not sure if I am overthinking this or not. I have advertised a room in my home to sublet. An acquaintance reached out to me and said she would be interested. I like her and we get along well, she’d be a great housemate. I am aware (she told me a few years back) that she has struggled with anorexia. I know she moved locations to access proper help in an inpatient program. My current partner is struggling with disordered eating and has done untreated for ~8 years. 

My partner formally reached out for help in mid 2020 but they really let her down... essentially she was too complex for some of their early interventions and then she went through multiple assessments for another intervention and they said she was ineligible and didn’t offer any further referrals (this crushed her as seeking help was so difficult for her). This happened over a period of approx two months and it worsened her AOD issues and she had to move back to her family home (who aren’t fully aware of her issues). 
She has recently started self harming again as well, and is highly resistant to seeking help. I don’t push her on this but I do try to gently encourage her... 

Anyway, my question is - is this a good housemate option? I am thinking of two of these people I care about. I don’t want to place my friend in the position of being triggered if she picks up on my partner’s disordered eating (who will stay here on occasion). Am I overthinking this?

Granted, I don’t exercise or do much physical activity at all.

I skip breakfast nearly every day unless my parents make me something, and I can often go until dinner before eating if they don’t remind me. I usually won’t eat anything unless it sounds particularly good, even if I’m hungry. My diet is pretty shit. It’s not unlikely that my lunch consists of a handful of hot cheetos and half a glass of water. Sometimes I won’t eat when I’m hungry just because I don’t feel like getting out of bed. 

I’m not depressed, though.

On the other hand, it’s not uncommon for me to stay up late only to get hungry enough to eat twice my dinner’s worth (I get full very easily). However, I do guilt myself out of eating late at night half the time, because I know I CAN wait until the next day to eat, and because it’s not socially acceptable to have a meal so late.

A big part of my job is investigating issues that go wrong with store deliveries one investigation can take betwern 15-30 mins depending on how badly it is messed up. On a usual day we get maybe 2-5 of these issues on top of our normal duties which fill up our 8 hour shift. Well on this one occasion it has turned put that there was a major error caused by a guy on nights and noone on nights or day shift had picked up on it and because it was such a major issue it caused us to have around 45-50 errors that I needed to investigate in an 8 hour shift whilst also trying to do my normal duties as well.

&amp;#x200B;

the sudden and drastic increase in work caused me a lot of stress as i could not keep up there was more errors coming out quicker than I could fix them. I hit a point where i broke down crying in the middle on the warehouse i had to walk outside and away from anyone else. When i came back inside i was still very stressed and ended up putting back a massive amount in less than 10 mins all made up on chocolate, cookies and cakes.

In HS and the first 3 years of college it was restriction and over-exercising, then it was bingeing and just feeling out of control all the time. Even when I was going to therapy, I didn’t talk about it so I didn’t get any treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been struggling to eat lately and feeling like such shit because I keep gaining weight. I started listening to the fck it diet podcast a few months ago and it always makes me feel better, and I always learn something new about my body and disorder. I finally bought the book (The Fck It Diet) and started journaling with the prompts, as well as finally getting therapy (and actually talking about it!) and it has helped me so much!!

&amp;#x200B;

Last Halloween I wanted candy, so I bought some. For the first week or so I felt like I couldn’t stop eating it, it’s all I wanted! But I just allowed myself to eat it and I still have some left in the freezer that I just don’t want. This has happened over and over with other “off limit” foods. I eat as much as I want and then the craving goes away. I don’t feel frantic or like I need to binge anymore (although sometimes it happens when I’m stressed/overwhelmed). I just try to be gentle with myself and enjoy eating.

&amp;#x200B;

It isn’t intuitive eating, it’s unrestricted eating with a focus on neutralizing food and getting our bodies out of starvation mode. It’s still scary, I still struggle with feeling guilty and being afraid to gain weight. But refocusing on giving my body and mind what it needs has been so refreshing.

22,EDPostRequests,1609713859,kpuxya,9,"I’ve been skinny for my entire life, I remember as a kid the doctor prescribed me what my mom would call “hungry pills” that i would take to increase appetite and shoot my weight up. My mom says she must have blocked out the memory, but I think she’s embarrassed or hiding the truth because I took those “hungry pills” daily for years and I never really knew what they were or specifically why I had to take them. She says it never happened but that’s not something I’d make up. Every day I went downstairs to take a vitamin gummy and a “hungry pill”, thats how it was. I stopped taking them before middle school.

Fast forward 10 years, I’m 18 and athletic but still skinny. I played basketball and football all through high school. Never underweight, but pretty close to that line on the BMI index. It seemed like no matter what I ate or how much I worked out, I stayed the same weight. I also grew from 5’5 to 6 foot in 4 years without adding any weight, and thats when my family started making comments about me being skinny. My muscle composition totally changed, I’m a long stronger now but the weight never increased. I stayed about the same all through high school.

Heres where the juicy part comes in

I’m 19 now and I’ve been getting sick. Not just upset stomach for a couple days sick, it’s a “live by the toilet or I’m puking on the ground” sick. I’ll drink water because if I don’t I’ll get dehydrated and have to go to the hospital for an IV. I can only keep water down for a few minutes before my stomach decides it needs to empty everything and keep puking until my sides cramp. It’s happened 3 times in the past year. 4-7 days of puking where I couldn’t eat anything at all. Towards the end I could have crackers or salted popcorn but my appetite really has to build up back to normal for 2 weeks. 

These sick bouts are making everybody in my life scared and are making me physically change. I know this sub isn’t supposed to use specific numbers, so I dropped from a barely healthy weight to an unhealthy weight. Gaining it back is really hard. I can’t just shoot up weight all at once, but it feels like every time I start making a difference I get sick again and lose all my progress and then I can’t eat normally for a couple weeks after being sick because my stomach has shrunk so much I get full off a couple bites

My parents have talked to doctors (without me) and the doctors told them I have anorexia based purely on weight charts, but I know anorexia is a lot more complicated than that. I look in the mirror and Im still attractive, I like the way I look but it would make my life a lot easier if i just weighed 30 more pounds. My parents are so involved with my weight that I think it’s overall detrimental. I get calls from their friends and distant family (people I never speak to) on a daily basis asking if I’m okay, even though I’m now fully recovered from my last sickness and never told them about it. I know they’re worried but I wish they never knew I was struggling in the first place. I hate the fact that their first thought about me in years was probably “he’s very sick and skinny I need to tell him we’re all worried”. I wouldn’t have told anyone, and no one would be worried, but they stole that opportunity from me and ignored me when I told them to keep it private. Now I have a line of people to respond to about every day and it’s just annoying more than anything. I love them but I really think they just want me to have the same body as them, which has never been the case in my entire life. 

It’s hard to be so sure though. I could have an eating disorder, I got sick every time after really bad days of anxiety usually following a panic attack. Then as my parents realized I was sick I would get more anxious knowing they’re going to tell my family and my nausea would just take over. I need this cycle to stop and I need to gain weight, even if I don’t have an ED I have something that isn’t right in my life and I want it to be fixed

23,EDPostRequests,1609713782,kpux1x,4,"Hi, I’m looking to help my friend with her Ed and I don’t have much knowledge on them. I was hoping this could be posted. 

My best friend is struggling openly with an eating disorder but I do not know how to help her. I’ve never had an ED, I’ve always been naturally skinny and eaten whatever I’ve wanted so I’ve been trying to research ED’s to better know how to help. 
I guess when she was younger she was heavier and she’s been thin since high school she’s 28 now. She is not skinny to a dangerous point at all. If you saw her in public you wouldn’t think she has an ED at all.
I had kind of started realizing she had an ED because she would constantly talk about how “fat” she was and I was so confused because she’s clearly not fat at all. She has an obsession with working out and is constantly counting her calories and weighing her food.
She went on this diet where she was only eating 300 calories a day and I told her that it sounded really unhealthy. She was a personal trainer for a little while and she told me that it was fine. I started realizing just how much she is constantly analyzing her body and complaining about how she looks, mix that together with the scary diets and I realized she had some kind of ED (in my opinion, I’m not a professional).

I kinda talked to her about it and she was like “oh yeah I for sure have an eating disorder”. Fast forward about 6 months to right now, and she told me she’s still only eating 300 calories a day and she feels so guilty if she eats more than that. She said she began purging again, which apparently she hasn’t done in years. She also said she gets light headed when standing up. She works out from home every day. Cardio, leg and butt workouts, etc.

Now again I know very little about this stuff so I apologize if I use the wrong terminology or get things incorrect, that’s why I’m here. The thing about her is that she doesn’t want to be super thin like a lot of the people suffering I’ve read about. She just has these obsessions with hitting these goal weights, idk it’s really hard to explain. 

Like she still wants to have a nice butt and muscle somewhat but also wants to continue to lose weight. I just don’t know how to help her. She feels comfortable telling me about it because I never judge her or tell her she needs immediate help, etc. she kinda told her boyfriend about it but he just says stuff like “omg you need to eat more! Order a burger!” Like he doesn’t get what’s really happening in her mind.

She thinks her eating disorder stems from a long history of childhood issues. Parents, being overweight at some point, sexual assault, etc. She’s also been trying to be an actress for years and has been in some movies and productions (she’s a great actress) but I feel like that adds to the pressure to be “attractive”. I think because her job is so hard she enjoys having control over her body if that makes sense.

Be forewarned: I’ve dealt with binge eating problems before, and this sub has helped me out a lot. The issue I’m about to describe differs in some confusing ways, and it involves a loved one who is not myself. 

My girlfriend has been mentioning dissatisfaction with her body for several months now, specifically targeting herself for not having “enough curves”. As a result, she’s been eating with the expressed goal of gaining weight for a few months now. Sadly, I’ve felt that her complaining about body dissatisfaction has only gotten worse with weight gain. I just am in a confusing position because I’m a girl who believes in health at every size and all that, so I’m not worried about her weight gain itself. I’m more worried about her reasons for such course of action; the way she processes and understands her body seems disordered. Even though she is probably physically healthy, her fixating on her body in any way worries me.

Does anyone know what I should do? Should we look into a doctor of some kind? Is it even worth bringing up with her?

28,EDPostRequests,1609713607,kpuuwm,24,"(Post submission) 

I’ve had an eating disorder for more than half my life, but the past ~4 years or so it miraculously hasn’t been bothering me like it used to. Maybe I’m in remission or something, but the urge to restrict and self harm just seemed to go away, and I’ve been quite healthy these past few years, at least compared to how I used to be. I was fine with not being remarkably skinny anymore. But now since covid, I’ve gained way more weight than I’m comfortable with, and it’s caused me to be really really dysmorphic. Some of my clothes aren’t fitting anymore either 😬 However, I’m proud of myself because a couple months ago I made the decision to start at the ((covid precaution-following!)) gym (something I absolutely never would have done when I was super anorexic because I always opted to lose weight via restriction and hated exercise). My goal was to get active and feel good, but not worry about calories— just to get up and get active, and get back to how I was pre-covid in the healthiest and safest way possible. I do a simple treadmill routine and that’s it. It’s done wonders for my mental health and I feel great.

But despite starting at the gym 2 or 3 months ago, I’m not seeing any results. I think I need to improve my routine a bit, and also do what every resource I’ve read is telling me to do, which is track calories and make a calorie deficit. And of course that’s stressing me out because going back to counting calories could very well become a rabbit hole for me, and since this is an ED support group I don’t think I need to explain why. But at the same time, I feel like if I don’t follow the standard recommendation of counting calories, my workouts aren’t going to be effective and I’ll be paying all this money in gym membership fees for nothing, and also continue to be unhappy with my body and sad. 

So, tl;dr, how do I exercise and eat well to slim down in a healthy, safe, and (for lack of a better word) neurotypical way, without becoming obsessed with calories again?

Around when this started, I started exercising and cooking foods that made me feel less horrible in my stomach in order to feel stronger and maybe lose some weight, but I also started using the acid reflux I was experiencing as an excuse to purge. When I had been nauseous for a few hours and food kept coming back up, I would purge it all.

Calorie counting, exercising till I felt like death, brain fog, refusing food, the familiar gut tugging feeling of your stomach contracting from lack of food, lapse in concentration. I shudder to think of it now.
Even though now I'm sorta doing better, I stopped counting and I've faced my fear foods alot and am eating now in a unrestricted manner, I absolutely detest how I look. I know I've gained weight (I used to be really underweight but now I'm legit borderline healthy and I hate it). I hate weight gain so much, the way my face is puffy, the way that I can see every single pound I've gained in my face, stomach, arms, legs. It's a nightmare. I want to go back to my restriction, back to my calorie counter, back to my friend ana because even though I may be romanticising how I was before, it's better than this. 
What's even weirder is I've tried going back in my old habits but they don't work??? I can't commit?? And I hate that about me, it's a betrayal. I can't go back to how I was and it's so hard for me to find the motivation to continue.

Today is the first day of the new year. I really want to end this negativity. If any of you have tips for getting over weight gain, refeeding syndrome, acceptance, remaining thin but also being healthy please let me know. I'm really struggling atm and I could use some help &lt;3

CW: Self harm, depression, ptsd, eating disorders.

I've been in a very bad place for a while now, and a couple days ago i posted on [r/TeensMeetTeens](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeensMeetTeens/). She pm'd me a few hours later. We talked about our various issues and i asked for her discord. we talked about a bunch of stuff and ended up sharing pics and venting to eachother, and we've revealed more to eachother about our personal self than anybody else in our lives. I dont want to be too corny, but we're basically in long distance relationship at this point, as she lives across the border in another country. I'm not going to go into detail, but she has a lot of trauma, as well as severe depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder. I'm doing my best to try and be supportive, as she essentially saved me from killing myself and i really like her as a person, but i'm worried about doing the wrong things or not helping her in the right way. I've made a deal with her that every time i think of self harming, i will stop and message her, but when i message her she has to send me photos of her eating. Her home life is pretty shit, although she has a very caring sibling, and she only has one other friend who lives far away from her. I'm very cautious of recommending professional help because of her home life, but i might recommend her to see a school counselor once schools are open again.

Hello everyone, 

I'm 18 years old, and I show a few but not all symptoms of having an  eating disorder. I am really underweight according to my BMI and find  myself eating small portions infrequently. 

I've never been diagnosed with or treated for an eating disorder, but  doctors have mentioned that it is possible. Thus, I am cognizant of  that and realized that it could involve a factor of issues such as poor  diet, a food allergy, and genetics.  

I've been trying to eat healthier recently, and I'm hoping to put on  some weight. I've never owned a scale before, and was wondering if I  should buy one? I've noticed that many medical websites said that scales  are very toxic, and I worry about getting into a bad habit of basing my  self worth of that number. I already tend do that with academics. :/

I  am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric  Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants  for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for  self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS.  tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that  delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes.  Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may  help treat depression and other conditions.

We  are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure  (through burning, cutting, or other means). The study involves  completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and six  sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a  double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active  or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from  your own home–no in-person visits are required.

Three  months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication  management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of  $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete  all research procedures.

Hi,

after months/years of being underweight with varied degrees of  severity, I'm back to my pre ED weight. I'm okay with my body now, I  feel ""me"" in it, it's just what I used to look before my ED started.  I've made huge progress mentally and I try to eat an ""adequate"" amount  of calories every day.

Yet I still binge. And when I binge, I purge because I'm scared of  weight gain and can't handle it. I'm constantly hungry, constantly  thinking about food.

Before my ED, I was already an adult and my weight used to be  extremely stable. I wouldn't weight myself often (because I didn't care  enough to do so) but I still wear the clothes I had when I was in high  school. My body size just didn't change that much. So I don't understand  why I cannot seem to maintain it now without restricting.

Nothing seems to work. I've been on a meal plan for a long time, and  not only it led me nowhere, but I've found that my ED thrives on meal  plans because it loves structure, rules and turning every prescription  or suggestion into obsessive rigidity. My therapist says that if I stop  restricting the binges will stop and my body will sort itself out, maybe  I will gain in the short term but then I will fall back to where I'm  supposed to be - but I don't believe him, because for me ""stop  restricting"" means binging on thousands of calories, or at least that's  what happens everytime I try to do it. It just seems a neverending cycle  and I'm exhausted. I literally can't sleep at night because I'm either  hungry and thinking about food, or scared of becoming overweight.

20f  here, and I have struggled with obsessive exercise tendencies and  caloric restriction over the past few years. When the pandemic started,  things got worse where I was consistently putting in high mileage running weeks of  running without rest days, though my restrictive eating improved  because I started to “accept” that it was okay to indulge a bit when  burning so many calories per day.

Just  over a month ago I had to stop running due to an overuse injury, and to  “make up” for it, I’ve been consistently working out (no-impact  Pilates, barre, indoor biking) for 2 hours a day. The problem is, I  definitely don’t think I’m burning as many calories as before but my  food intake hasn’t decreased and I’m starting to feel extremely stressed  and anxious to the point that I re-downloaded MyFitnessPal. I’ve tried  to tell myself that the muscular definition I’ve put on since the injury  is a good thing, but I can feel that I’m on the verge of relapsing into  restrictive dieting. I haven’t gained a lot of weight since I generally  eat healthy foods, but for the first time since my initial experience  with a restrictive ED, I’ve become determined to go back to being  underweight. I am bothered by the fact that my leggings almost fit  properly again (no longer loose), but I am aware that this is unhealthy  and I genuinely hate that my brain thinks this way.

After a few months of  restricting and binging, about a month and a half ago, I truly turned a  corner and started eating regularly. I felt awesome. I had energy and  peace of mind for the first time in years.

Idk how it happened, but I slipped back into restricting. This time,  it’s easier. I barely have an appetite. I can feel the minimal eating’s  impact on my energy and attention span. It’s making it so much harder to  work and I’m getting weirdly obsessed with my appearance because,  honestly, I like how I’m clearly losing weight. 

I know this is the honeymoon phase. I’ve been here before, and I  can’t imagine this is sustainable or going to end well. But it’s so hard  to convince myself I need to eat three times daily when I’ve gone so  many days without doing that. 

This really was on accident, and I don’t want to hit rock bottom  again or get back into regular binging. That was the worst part, but I  fear I’ll get so hungry and deprived that I’ll lose control, binge, and  lose sight of a normal eating cycle altogether.

So I’m not sure if I have an ED or not. I know I have disordered eating (I’ll eat well one day and then the next few days I’ll either eat nothing or minimal amounts) and I’m terrified of gaining weight but I don’t know if that constitutes an ED.

I have done screening tests and I know you can’t trust everything you see online, but these are all from reputable sources and they’ve suggested that I’m at least at risk of an ED.

About 6 years ago is when it began and even though I was only about 14 and don’t remember much I remember obsessing over losing weight (even though looking back I was already so slim even though I thought I was extremely big). I would make myself throw up and was very restrictive with food trying to eat very little calories. About a year later the my eating patterns subsided, however these thoughts that I was overweight, my body was horrible, and I needed to lose weight in order to be deemed valuable continued. 


Flash forward to my first year of university and I gained some weight and then once the pandemic and quarantine hit I had a significant weight gain, rendering me overweight. This is where I lost it and went back to these behaviours of throwing up and eating very few calories. In the past few months I lost weight rapidly using these unhealthy tactics but it got me to a what healthcare professionals would deem a “healthier weight”. My obsessive picking apart of my body and the impossible bodily standards I set for my myself that I feel I need to attain just to be deserving of happiness is definitely a problem. But is the eating? Losing the weight I feel like was good and I’m not even underweight now so I feel like I can’t even consider what I have an eating disorder.

68,EDPostRequests,1610452082,kvq700,15,"I had a decade-long ED battle. I met my friend (F26) a little over a year ago and one of the first things she told me was she had an ED, specifically binging. I did my best to help her and even told her about my experiences. 

I’m about two years clean now. Or.. was. 

So she decided she wanted to lose some weight. Fair enough. She started a strict and unhealthy diet to do so and I again tried to help, but realised I couldn’t. 

She kept posting pics of her alarmingly quick weight loss to our group chat and all of our friends praised her for losing weight. None of our friends minus my partner and myself have had EDs and don’t know how they work. However, all of us do have body dysmorphia problems. 

Every topic she brought up was food, numbers, waist sizes, etc and it was super triggering. I asked her personally several times to please not bring it up in front of me because of how triggering it was. She’d get upset, but agree. 
However, she’d always get right back to it like I never said anything. 

It even got to the point our friends were telling me it was beginning to trigger them, but they didn’t know how to approach her about it since she was so “proud”. 

then I relapsed. I left the group chat for a month and didn’t talk to everyone. But my relapse was common knowledge. Once I joined again, the first conversation was of course her weight loss and relating topics of such. 

After the fifth or sixth time in under three months of asking, I finally had enough and left again. She knew something was up because she kept talking to our friends about me and trying to get my attention. 

I got so stressed out, I left social media. I did a stupid thing and checked her Twitter while signed out and saw her publicly talking about “someone being triggered because of her being proud of her success” and absolutely gaslighting my feelings, so I can assume she got the memo now and was just playing dumb. And of course, her other friends were backing her up. It’s taking everything in me not to hop on and publicly call her out on it   

I’m slowly coming out of my relapse, but it’s hard. She’s now dating my best friend so it makes it even harder to avoid her. 
When I get back online after I talk to my therapist in a few days, I think I’m gonna ditch her and cut the friendship so I can focus on my own health and recovery. Unfortunately, I’ll have to distance myself from my best friend too, who is backing her up.

It is not what I would consider to be a standard eating disorder, but I am certainly no expert, hopefully someone can point me in the right direction. It's been building over the last year or so. 

My 13 year old son started having some issues dealing with noise while he eats. At first it was an occasional burp from me that would put him off his food. Then, it was the sound of my eating. Now he claims that he can't stand to eat around other people and would prefer to eat on his own. Last night was the first night that he outright asked to go eat in the basement instead of at the table. (I guess it could be my eating specifically that sets him off, but I asked my wife last night if I am an abnormally loud eater and she didn't think so) His issue tends to be worse in a quiet environment, he doesn't usually complain about it in public at a restaurant. Knowing that however, I had turned up the radio during dinner last night to combat it, and ate as quietly as possible, but it still wasn't enough. I'm not sure if this is even an issue, or if it is a phase that maybe he will get over as he gets older.

 Since he is an only child, I worry that if I let his issue get the better of him, it will cause issues later in life with regards to his ability to eat socially with other people. He has a healthy appetite and is not a picky eater (other than he doesn't like his food touching on his plate, but that is a less worrisome issue in my mind.) He is also a self proclaimed introvert, so I also worry that he is secluding himself unnecessarily and it could enhance feelings of loneliness.

Anyways, I have noticed the last month that my body has changed. Last year around this time I was working out 4-5 days a week and didn’t worry about clothes fitting or what I am eating. I felt so comfortable with myself and focused more on health than body image. Once gyms closed I stopped working out. I lost all muscle tone, I began snacking, and just not making the healthiest of choices. So, I have gained a significant amount of weight. It is all throughout my body, not entirely my stomach. I have bulges in my back that I have never noticed and I just struggle feeling good in my clothes (doesn’t help that some are getting tighter).

I have the life sum app that used to track food, water intake, and exercise. Although I am starting to change my eating habits by not snacking, making healthier choices, and not over eating, I am struggling to exercise. This has led me to counting calories, constantly thinking about calories or if said food will affect my weight negatively (even for healthy dishes), constantly body checking, feeling bad for eating. I have not gotten to the point of skipping meals or under-eating consistently but I am happy when I am xxx under calories. I think if I could just get my head outta the clouds and workout despite what the depression is telling me, I will be better, however, that is easier said than done.

Any advice to overcome this, re-assurance, or well wishes is greatly appreciated.",Request: I am developing ED habits.Help?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/kvq0ux/request_i_am_developing_ed_habitshelp/,1610469261.0,2021-01-12 05:34:21

81,EDPostRequests,1610277205,kucpfn,6,"My mom has always been really conscious about her weight and me and my brother's weights. She always makes meals for us, but never for herself. My stepdad always comments on her not eating anything when she gave us bowls and plates and purposefully never gave herself one. Her excuse for not eating with us is ""I already ate a lot while I was cooking"" or ""I'm not hungry"". I rarely see her eating, and when she does choose to eat some of the meal she cooked for us, she announces it like she wants us to know that's the ONLY thing she ate. 
And my mom is definitely underweight and never admits it. I feel like the constant prodding by my stepdad isn't helping her, as she seems to play it coy when she tells him she's not eating. As if it's attractive. I'm really concerned for her health and I feel like the attention she gets when she doesn't eat is actually enabling this eating disorder. More evidence that makes me think this:  She tells me she brushes her teeth right after ""dinner"" (she didn't eat anything for dinner) so she doesn't feel the need to eat after she brushes her teeth. Every time she weighs herself, she says she's heavy and she gained weight just so my stepdad can assure her she's still skinny. I don't think this behavior is normal. I don't know how much she really eats because she's at work most of the day, but when she's at home she RARELY eats. 
Onto my brother's developing ED:
When my stepdad isn't at our house (he's only at our house once every two weeks) she makes meals for me and my brother that are already portioned in a bowl. Whenever we can't finish for more than a few meals in a row, she get's pretty pissed off, and as a result my brother and I feel pressured to finish the meals. She always fed us a lot and then criticize my brother that he's getting too heavy, whenever he showed her a picture of him, she would say he looks fat in that photo. But he still had to eat her meals. 
Her solution? To run and exercise a lot. My brother really doesn't like exercising and he feels that the other option is to diet; but my mother, as previously shown, doesn't like that idea. So my brother found a loophole, and started sleeping till noon every single day in order to avoid eating breakfast (my mom emphasizes sleep a lot and would not wake us up if we didn't absolutely have to). My brother skipping meals made him start to lose weight (he didn't need to lose weight because he was already at a healthy weight) made my mom compliment him and reward him. 
I feel like her positive attitude towards him losing weight is encouraging this behavior of skipping meals. He really doesn't need to lose weight and I don't want him to not eat anything just like my mom. I'm just the sister/daughter in this relationship and I don't know what to do. The environment me and my brother are in is just centered around weight and being fit. Any advice? Thanks. 
Btw, talking to my mom won't work because me and my brother previously talked to her about her ed a lot, and she refused to admit she had any eating disorder and got frustrated at us because we kept bringing it up.",Request: I think my mom has an eating disorder and my brother is developing one because of it,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/kucpfn/request_i_think_my_mom_has_an_eating_disorder_and/,1610295205.0,2021-01-10 05:13:25

I just sat in my room this evening cup of tea in hand and closed/opened/closed/opened the delivery Ap on my phone. Attempted distraction after distraction. Hours long internal war.

84,EDPostRequests,1610155950,ktgxng,8,"A little backstory about me and my condition. I started bulimia when i was 14 years old. I was a chubby kid, and i played basketball and my biggest issue was my weight, so I figured if I become bulimic i could get in shape and take my game to the next level, it worked. I was bulimic til I was 17 and it felt good, i had a-lot of attention from girls, i looked good, i felt good about it and i thought it was okay. But one day I looked at my teeth and I realized the damage that started to occur so I quit purging for 2 years, i had pearly whites and they were very yellow and started cording. So i stopped for 2 years, it was tough, i went from xxxlbs and in shape to being yyylbs and obese. 

I had everyone telling me basically how bad i looked at whether it was my friends, my doctor my family it was horrible but i fought threw it those 2 years. When i was 19 I started dating a very pretty girl that indirectly made me feel so insecure about myself. So much so while dating her i figured i have to become bulimic so i can look good for her and make her physically attracted to me and to be confident in myself, so it started. Throughout college i was bulimic and it got so bad at points that i would purge and have nothing in my system then drink and almost kill myself accidentally from alcohol poisoning i started to feel random pains in my body and all that, my teeth are corroded to the point the bottoms of my teeth arent straight anymore they are uneven and i even had my tooth chip because they were so weak and i bit down on them too hard. 

I got told by a doctor when i have a fatty liver but never went back because i was scared to find out more. Anyways i had some very personal things happen to me that out me in a really bad spot, i started purging alot more to the point i wouldn't even let food digest i would instantly go to the bathroom and make myself throw up. I dropped from xxxlbs to yyylbs i did catch covid aswell which may have contirbuted to a small part of my weight loss but nothing significant. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont play sports havent for 4 years therefore even though i have lost alot of weight my body i am now skinny fat which is even worse because atleast before i was pretty strong now i feel weak. I have been thinking of recovery for a couple years now but I am not ready for that weight gain. I am 24 and i feel like I have completely ruined my life and any chance of future happiness or confidence with myself. What doesnt help is im from a low class neighborhood some would consider the “hood” and the hyper masculinity in it doesnt help as if you ever talk about mental illness or an eating disorder people will look at you crazy and even gossip about you which is bad because i have no where to escape to about it So i had attempted 2 times to reach out to a doctor for help, and the response they would get is instant confusion as to me being bulimic almost as if i dont sort the criteria of what a bulimic looks like( i know there is no way there supposed to look but others ovbiously dont) which really had not helped my situation.

 I also have dont have friends who could help because i dont feel comfortable letting them know because i had gotten scarred when i told my ex and she left, i thought i could trust her with the world and she did me wrong when i let her know whats going on with me. I therefore dont have the courage to go to a friend. I rambled a little but, My question to you guys is what should i do to recover? I cant stress enough how I really do not want to gain weight, in fact I am terrified about it! I know weight gain is normal but i know my weight gain will be very extreme and im not ready for that at all, i dont think i ever will be. Its hard knowing we live in such a superficial world where looks are everything, and the fact that i get alot of attention from women now and treated because my face has slimmed down and the rest of my body really doesn’t help.

I want to get my life back together but i cant deal with his weight gain that will happen i know myself im not okay with it. I tried researching online and a lot of the support groups or advice is aimed at women and not so much men which is good that somethings being done but its hard to even find someone that can relate to me or give me advice on recovery.

85,EDPostRequests,1610155456,ktgsm5,24,"
First off I’m going to give as much info as possible and I apologize if any of it seems insensitive to others eating disorders or somehow triggering. So my girlfriend (21) of 7ish months is recovering from anorexia, she started doing a bit better a month or two before we started dating but has made great progress since that time. Her anorexia didn’t appear to be as severe as it can be for some individuals but she was certainly malnourished. 

I am a very health conscious person, extremely active (sports/lifting) after our first couple months she was doing much better, she had gained a few pounds. She was feeling better and having less health problems, most of those weird aches and pains and health issues that she seemed to have 5 days out of 7 were almost gone. Shortly after that she decided she wanted to start going to the gym with me, she had always wanted to go but never had the confidence to learn everything you need to know to lift by her self. It’s been a few months and she has gone up another few lbs. She looks great but she wants to trim down a few lbs of fat which she is being nitpicky but I can confirm that there is some fat she can lose that would be within a healthy range. She’s at healthy body fat percentage and I know this because we went to take a body analysis test shortly after starting to workout which I know may not seem like a good idea for many with an ED but I try to be very sensitive to the situation and she has handled it very well (I think numbers can be useful and cool to help see progress and growth with muscle and other factors). 

So what I am worried about is if her body has had enough time to recover, her energy levels are as high as they have been in years and she is healthy and feels good 98% of days. But does her body still need more time to regulate? Could cutting down a few  lbs be harmful to her at this stage? I’ve tried researching what happens after recovering from Anorexia and I can not figure out if this would be ok or if her body would even allow it? I’ve read some things, and it makes sense intuitively to me, that the body in an anorexic situation tries to store as much body fat as it can as a response since it knows it may be a minute before the individual provides it with more fuel. So could it take months to a year for the body to transition to storing and utilizing energy the way healthier bodies do? The only reason I am considering agreeing with the situation and not fighting her a bit on it is because we are planning on getting married in a few months and I get that and want her to feel like she’s at her most beautiful.

92,EDPostRequests,1610155142,ktgpd0,3,"Hi. This requires some background so I apologize for the length.

I have had dietary restrictions due to food intolerances for three years. Lots of food I can't eat, including nearly all grains, dairy, soy, and a handful of fruits and vegetables. It basically means there is very little processed, pre-prepared, frozen, or restaurant food that I can eat, and I cook nearly everything I eat myself. Due to some still-undiagnosed digestive problems I developed this past year, I adopted an even more restrictive diet (the low FODMAP diet) a few months ago to control my symptoms, which helps somewhat. It's supposed to be temporary, I have just been waiting on some test results, so it's lasted much longer than I anticipated. 

Because of this, I have a lot of difficulty feeding myself. I gained weight without realizing in the last few months because I was snacking on peanut butter mixed with maple syrup to help curb my hunger; not eating enough during the day triggers my insomnia so I sometimes overeat without realizing in attempt to prevent that. Since then, I've been trying to manage these restrictions without eating too much sugar or fat, so I don't keep gaining weight. I've been having a lot of smoothies (spinach, fruit, coconut oil, collagen peptides) because I have a lot of fatigue and am often too tired to cook or meal plan. When I do cook the restrictions make it hard to plan well-balanced meals. So I am sometimes eating just potatoes or just meat instead of a ""complete"" meal. Also, I have a tendency to ""ration"" food so I don't run out before I'm ready to get more. (Example: only eating one serving per meal/not getting seconds, or only eating two meals a day instead of three.) This is both so I don't have to cook as often and because maintaining my diet can be kind of expensive. 

To help my anxiety, which has been worse than ever this year, I started off January doing a 30-day yoga challenge. While it's helped my anxiety tremendously, my fatigue is killer. I don't know if I need to eat more while doing daily yoga, or how much, but I am scared of gaining more weight and mostly, I don't have the energy to figure out what to cook. Today my therapist asked if I might need treatment for eating disorders and I was totally taken aback. I don't even feel like I have control over what or how I eat right now. I'm just trying to get by until I get some medical answers and can hopefully expand my diet again.

I guess I should note that I don't binge, and I don't really restrict except for the obvious food intolerances that give me symptoms. I do try to avoid added sugar because I can overindulge very easily, plus it makes my anxiety worse.

98,EDPostRequests,1610153081,ktg3h7,4,"I’m a 21F, all my life i’ve struggled with my weight. I have memories of people shaming my body since I was 4 years old, saying for example why I don’t suck in my stomach, one day an aunt asked me when I will start the diet. One day I was sick and she told my grandma that she will give me pills but the doses of an adult because I has bigger than I should. 

wasn’t even 10yo when I heard those comments and I can’t stop thinking about them. In my school I was the bigger of my classroom even though I was never obese, just overweight, maybe  few more kg more than I should. My classmates didn’t bully me a lot but some comments hurted me a lot, my brother and my cousin were the most hurtful, they told me I was fat everyday. I’ve always pretended the comments of my body were funny but inside I’m sick of them, I all I thought was when people meet me they will think that I’m fat, fat was the only word that described me. Before 12yo I thought I wasn’t big, that I will loose weight naturally and I shouldn’t worry about it. Puberty came and boys started commenting on my body, saying I was fat, my acne was ugly, etc so at the age of 13 I lost a lot of weight. I was hungry all the time i had a rough idea of how many calories I consumed,

&amp;#x200B;

 i maintained that weight for 2 years and then I couldn’t restrict myself anymore so I started eating all the foods I didn’t allow myself to eat, I gained most of the weight I had lost. I was so traumatized of how my body looked before so I started doing a lot of exercise and in that time I met a guy so I wasn’t thinking much about food I just remember I never ate because I wasn’t hungry enough( unconsciously I think I was restricting myself) and lost the amount  I gained. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next year I didn’t think about food but idk how I slowly gained all the weight back, the boy left me and until today I think he left me because I gained weight and I wasn’t attractive anymore. I’ve yo-yo dieting since then, I’ve lost and gain a few  kg several times, and my body image when I’m xx kg(a healthy weight) is terrible, I can’t stop thinking of how bad I look and I can’t loose weight. 

I’ve run until 1am just to lose weight, also I’ve thrown up a few times(maybe 4), I’ve tried everything and nothing works losing weight seems imposible and I feel sick of trying. The idea of accepting myself with this weight seems imposible to me, that thought stays in my mind 24/7 I’m so tired of hating myself. Going out with my friends is a horrible sensation because I always compare myself to them, the people around me is so skinny and I am so big, i try to eat healthy most of the time but my family always buys junk food and I can’t resist all the time. I have been thinking about going to therapy for 1 years but I have delayed taking the hour for so long! the next week I have an appointment to therapy but I’m scared of telling all the things I’ve been through.

105,EDPostRequests,1611106953,l0yrux,6,"Hi there. This is my first time posting here. I have felt the need to talk about this with someone for so long that I have finally decided to share how I feel since this seems like a safe space.

I (16F) technically don’t have an ed since I have never been diagnosed or gone to a doctor for this. Based off of what I have read, I think I might: I usually won’t eat till late at night, I hate my body, I wish I could be thinner, I constantly compare my body to others, I weigh myself continuously through out the day, I try not to eat any heavy/dense foods that could influence my weight (like water or potatoes)

A while ago, my mom took me to a nutritionist to gain weight and work on my eating since I’m a cross country runner. I was extremely underweight. I told both my mom and the nutritionist that my low weight was just because I am running a lot and I told them I wanted to gain weight and be healthy (this was a lie and I said nothing about my poor relationship with food). I tried to delay the weight they wanted me to gain for as long as possible by throwing out my lunches in school, running a lot, drinking water before getting weighed, and wearing heavy clothes when getting weighed). Then one day, my mom yelled at me, saying that I probably have an ed and asking why I would do this to her. I promised her that I wanted to gain weight (a lie) and told her I did not have an ed. This event basically scared me into eating a lot and reaching my goal weight (I was extremely unhappy with my body at that point)

Now, almost a year later, I feel so lost and alone. I hate my body and stare at it constantly in the mirror. I have lost some weight since then. I would like to weigh even less, but I don’t want my mom to notice; whenever she brings up my weight, I immediately panic and convince her I’m fine. I’m so scared of what will happen if she finds out I’m significantly below a normal weight, especially since I have been lying to her about my eating and weight for an entire year (when she asks how much I weigh, I lie and say I’m where I should be when in reality I’m much lower). I feel like she just doesn’t understand what it’s like for someone who feels like I do; it’s not as simple as just eating more food. I’m so desperate to tell someone (like a family member or even a teacher), but I’m scared of what will happen. If my mom finds out, she’ll hate me.

Has anyone else encountered a similar situation? I just feel so lost and lonely, I don’t know what to do. Maybe I’m overreacting idk. Any advice or replies would be appreciated.

106,EDPostRequests,1611106943,l0yrq8,2,"First of all, I want to say that I'm thankful places like this exist.

Okay, let's go. This will probably suck. 
Sorry.

I'm SICK of my distorted self-perception. 
I was always thin (ooh you could be a model, wow I wish I had your metabolism, etc. 🙃) and at the same time I always saw myself a little ¿chubby? jsksks hate that word.
Anyway, never payed that much attention to it until a few years ago. The disconnection between my real body and the image I have of it began to increase.
Last year it's been a hell, mostly in my mind.
At the beginning of the quarantine I noticed I was really underweight because my period (that was somehow starting to normalize) stopped, and I started to feel very cold and that my bones ached? like when I would lie in bed or lean my hips against something, for example a wall.
I tried to eat more bc my mother was worried and I got scared. Also, close people told me how thin I was and that made me feel bad. 
I was tired of looking like a cadaver, so a couple of months later started weightlifting. That helped me gain a few Kg.
Thing is, I really made progress since I started exercising because I noticed how my muscles grew. BUT I'd switch (and still do) between moods, going from fucking Patrick Bateman and wanting to kiss my biceps, to thinking 'damn, I'm really skinny. Gotta do something RN, I must take this as serious as it is'. And then """"""realize"""""" I'm overreacting and being ridiculous, because obviously I'm not that skinny. In fact, I should lose some weight, train harder or do something to fix myself.
If you ask me, being as realistic and objective as I can, I'd say I'm not fat at all. I know I'm thin.
But when it comes to my twisted reality~, everything changes. And I don't know what the fuck to do.
On the one hand I want -and often think about- to commit and try to reach my daily calorie intake, buy that whey protein I was looking for, keep exercising, stop being obsessed blah blah
The problem is that I JUST CAN'T. I have this stupid fixed idea that I'll end up getting fat when I know I won't bc my body doesn't work that way and bc it's all made-up 
So I'll restrict (conscious or unconsciously), feel bad if I don't have time to exercise, weigh everything I eat, if I can't weigh it I'll spend a lot of time thinking about it and trying to figure it out so I can register that on the damn app.
I literally will stand in front of the mirror and look at my clavicles, ribs, hips and then think 'Okay, Imma show myself how mature I am. I will start by doing all of the meals and reaching my cals next week'.
Next, look at my protruding bones again and realize I'm gonna miss that.
I want to do it because I know I should, I know this isn't healthy and I already have other mental problems, I don't need more.
But I can't let it go. I like being skinny.
I know that if I start eating just pizza, ice cream and Coke I will still be skinny but 1) my mind doesn't care about those facts, it's like 'hell no, if you even think about putting a finger on that banana you'll end up in one of those home&amp;health shows.
2) Guilt. If I eat something that isn't healthy I feel really bad. If I eat the calories I'm supposed to eat, I feel bad. If I'm hungry while others aren't, I feel bad. If I eat two portions when everyone ate one, I feel bad.  
Since I wake up I'm thinking about how many calories I ate, how much I'm gonna weigh tomorrow, obsess about how is the next meal going to be so it fits my macros...
If my friends or someone invites me to do something that involves food I'll think all the time about what are we gonna eat, what can I do to reject that food, how can I replace it and under what excuse, etc. etc.

And as if that wasn't enough, during quarantine I struggled with some notsobig binges here and there. Luckily that's being solved.
Many times thought about throwing up just bc I felt full and that disgusted me. Always stopped myself bc I have many reasons not to do it.
I finally did after Christmas (partly because I got sick) and realized puking is awful and that I don't wanna do it on a daily basis. I guess that's the only good thing.
On top of that, lately I've felt depression is back. Although I really like to cook, I don't have the energy to do it. I just lie on the couch thinking I'm hungry, should eat. But not being able to stand up and grab something. Usually a few hours pass until I decide what I'm going to eat, and always ends up being idk water and two noodles I found stuck on the floor.

So basically my younger sister is doing some things which are triggering my ED mindset, such as skipping meals, or eating very little for instance, only an apple for lunch (nothing else before or after) and then dinner as normal and eating very slowly, then drinking loads of water after/tea (looks like she's trying to fill herself up or has read something online about it). 

It's like she's read loads of stuff online about weightless (stupid stuff like no bread, no pasta, no rice, only eat fruit and eggs, drink water/tea before and after meals etc..) 

Just really hard to be in a positive mindset about food near her. However, if I am away from her I constantly worry she is trying to follow these stupid rules/habits she has read online and believes is good for weight loss/being 'healthy'. I also noticed in her search history she was looking at ways to lose weight and by no means do I think she should since she is at a healthy weight and her body is healthy (menstral cycle and that). 

Also also, another issue I have is that my dad constantly talks about these 'healthy' lifestyle choices and promotes it (like intermittent fasting, not eating bread, rice, pasta etc. which is so STUPID especially to teenagers!!). My sister never really listened but it seems like she has now, she does all the things he has 'advised' and it's quite worrying. I've spoken to this about her and it seems like she now believes eating breakfast, bread, rice, pasta will make you unhealthy, so she doesn't. However my dad worries about her since she doesn't really eat that much anymore (controversial right?)

122,EDPostRequests,1610919514,kzfnj7,8,"Hi!

I (25, M) have had incredibly disordered eating for a number of years now. Very long story short, I was a thin child from a fat family, used to be a ballet dancer, quit ballet, put on a lot of weight to the point I was clinically morbidly obese, spiralled into alcoholism (I'm 2 years sober now and in a 12 Step Program), then in 2017 I had a break from university (took ""leave"" in February 2017 to restart that academic year in September 2017, because of the aforementioned addiction issues) and I decided that I wanted to lose weight, I decided to do this with extreme calorie restriction (aided by a particular phone app that counts calories in food) and more than quadrupling my exercise (the same app also uses step count on your phone to work out how many calories you're burning, I passed out at the gym multiple times, had ketone breath, everything, but I didn't think I had an ED because, in my mind at the time, people with ED don't think about food, they think about weight, also, I was objectively, medically still overweight, so I told myself that I couldn't have an ED, I just like to get things done fast and not by half measures). 

Without going too heavy on this and glorifying it or using numbers, the amount of weight I lost in such a short space of time meant that when I went back to my university just to visit for the end of year ball, people genuinely didn't recognise me, I felt great etc etc. The problem is that ever since late 2017 and now, and especially since I got sober at the end of 2018, I have lost and regained the same *amount* in weight about 10 times through a mix of unhealthy secret binging and then extreme restricting, when I stopped losing weight I was actually underweight in BMI. 

Lockdown has been awful, I have been binging full on most days and I'm now back at a weight that I haven't seen since 2017, I'm only a few pounds away from being technically overweight again. I'm in the UK and we're currently in our third national lockdown, and now that I don't have the emotional support blanket of alcohol (a blanket that I do not want back, my life is so much better sober) I just can't stop myself binging until I feel sick, hating myself, then doing extreme home workouts during the day and then binging at night and body checking, my particular issue is with my chest, one of the reasons I wanted to lose weight in the first place is that I had a lot of fat on my chest and now after I binge, I feel like I can feel my chest expanding- which I know logically is ridiculous, but such is disordered binge eating haha. 

I don't know if anyone in here knows how to break the toxic cycle of this? I've been struggling with this immense self hatred, and I really want to break the cycle. I actually logged onto my laptop today to try and trigger myself into restricting massively tomorrow, but I know that if I heavily restrict, I'll just end up binging again and i really don't want to spend another night feeling so full that I feel sick or trying to avoid my reflection in shiny surfaces or not getting undressed before bed because I can't bring myself to look at my body etc etc etc.

I'm so sorry for the long post, I've literally never talked to anyone about this before and it's been going on since 2017, everyone I know sees me as some beacon of weight loss and turning your life around, when really, I'm a fraud in that regard. The closest I've come to any help is that I've watched a couple of YouTube videos (Of Herbs and Altars and Chris Henrie) and I watch their videos like ""ooh damn, I used to do x...

Background: I have been anorexic and bulimic for almost a decade. I went to get help in high school but was told that, given my condition, I had to go into inpatient and I wasn’t willing to leave school/sport/friends/family etc. outpatient was not an option. It got worse and I went to get help in college through my schools ED program but I stopped because, although my doctor/nutritionist/therapist left the decision up to me, they relentlessly pushed inpatient treatment on me which I was again unwilling to do. They would ask things like “do you not want to get help because you’re suicidal?” and I couldn’t deal so I stopped seeing them. I have an eating disorder yes but I think I am strong. I wanted to avoid seeing myself in the light with which they saw me- a wounded bird and deranged person wrapped up in one. Things got a little better within another year so I tried again but ran into the same issue where I was told that outpatient was not an option. My weight is the worst it’s been but I’m still unwilling to take a semester off or forego an internship this summer to get help. I am unable to recover alone. I’ve tried so many times. I know I should do inpatient but I wont make that choice for myself. 

How can I get help without having to put my “life” as i know it on pause? I was thinking that perhaps because of covid, there are more rigorous outpatient programs that I could engage in while remaining in school. Maybe treatment centers are offering outpatient for patients that would (in a covid-less world) need inpatient. I don’t have the strength to call and ask because I anticipate having to go through the same thing I did in the past. If anyone knows that this may be true what is it like? Is anyone in treatment and school at the same time? Or perhaps there’s a totally different medium I could try like a support group that may work?

The thing is that there like some little small things that might not be considered totally normal, but its not like stopping my life.

I have a bf and I love him, he knows that I had an ed for a long time so thats like it. The thing is that he smokes weed and doesnt eat much because he is not hungry. I dont think is disordered because I know many people that smoke and I feel this tends to happen. He eats like once a day, maybe twice and I cant eat like that, I need snacks and proper food a few times per day, but living together has made it difficult.

When we stayed together for a day or two, when I got home the first thing I did was EAT! Like I was so hungry... Somehow I am ashamed the amount of food I really wanna eat, or how many times I wanna eat per day. Also I feel guilty about eating the food that I bought lol, like as its food from the two I feel bad about just grabbing something, because its been a few times were he's been like ""I was gonna use that for a recipie"" or I was getting pizza leftovers (I ate half of the leftovers and left half for him) and was like ""why didnt you ask if I wanted"". So in essence I have to ask for permission for food I bought in my own house and that triggers me AF. It makes me feel I dont deserve it!

Oh I forgot to say, I can go on walks and just grab something eat it and go back home, I mean its not ideal because eating in secret is like not too good, but at least I would get nourished. I also did wait sometimes he went out to eat, I tried to eat stuff that I guess he wouldnt mind like rice or some stuff (I know this is also kinda f up), but 2 days ago I got covid, I am fine and all, just tired and I am gonna be fine. The thing is that I cant eat in secret now and I am eating the same stuff and the same portions and the same times as he is and gosh I am so hungry!

. Idk what to do, I wish I could just go to the fridge and grab food and cook it and eat it like any normal person but gosh I am just on the bedroom crying and being hungry.

Since then I’ve been doing well, eating three times a day, keeping balanced nutrition, getting a healthy level of low impact exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. 

Recently I put on a few pounds, and have been feeling absolutely awful about it, even though I’m still well within the healthy range. I have been trying to maintain a healthy diet regardless of my disordered thoughts. To do this, I told myself I had to eat when my boyfriend eats. We live together, so encouraging that we eat meals together has really kept me motivated to eat enough to stay healthy. 

The problem is that over time this subconsciously shifted from “I have to eat if my boyfriend is eating”, to “I can’t eat if my boyfriend isn’t eating”, and I didn’t even notice the shift. He recently had his wisdom teeth taken out and can’t eat regular meals. I have been spiraling into my eating disorder since. 

I have a hard time getting myself to eat in front of him if he’s not also eating. But I am aware that I need food to survive and remain in recovery. I went from eating a well balanced three meals per day to the last few days where I’ve only drank coffee. Today I forced down a small salad and a few chips. But I can’t keep up like this. I have tremendous guild whenever I feel hungry, I have noticed that I’m checking my body frequently, and I can’t stop wondering how much I weigh. 

How do I get control of my disorder again? I feel so stupid, because it almost feels like it never left. I can’t really talk to my boyfriend about how I’ve been feeling. I have been in recovery for our entire relationship. He knows I had an eating disorder years ago, and that health is important to me, but we don’t really talk about it.

136,EDPostRequests,1610766345,kyal8j,3,"The subject of food has always been touchy for me. I’ve struggle with poor body image, which has lead to calorie counting, restricting, and then ultimately binging at the end of the day when I’m absolutely starving. 


I’ve reached a point in my life where I’m more accepting of my body and where I’m eating more regularly during the day. Some days I eat more, some days I eat less. I’ve also stopped labeling foods as good and bad — some days I eat *healthier*, some days I want a donut. Which has helped a lot. 


One thing that still and will probably always make me uncomfortable is when someone points out to me how much/little, or what I’m eating. This has always bothered me, and it feels like they’re pointing out something bad.


I work as a massage therapist, I’m usually always snacking on something in between appointments. (Not always, but some days I’m a little hungrier.) Well this year I decided to add a proper lunch break into my schedule. A colleague mentioned she noticed the 1/2 hour break I added in. “It makes sense, you’re always snacking in between clients” is what she said to me. This isn’t the first time a colleague has pointed out how much I eat while at work. The last time it happened, they called me Miss. Piggy. Another colleague laughed at me the other day “I always see you eating” — I decided to lightly clap back and say “Well I either eat now or  binge when I get home.” Then they retracted what they said. I don’t think they intended to hurt my feelings— but it did. 


It’s even worse when someone comments on *what* you’re eating.

I’m not sure if this is the correct place to post this as i don’t believe i necessarily have an eating disorder, so if anyone has a better community to post this in please let me know because i am getting so desperate. 

first off, i have depression, anxiety, and adhd. i’m definitely prone to eating disorders and have had close family members who are in recovery. so i’ve always been cautious to make sure to nip any unhealthy mindsets about food in the bud if they arose. but anyway, to my dilemma. I had breast reduction surgery on 10/8. it’s a pretty easy procedure but it’s still a surgery and my body is still recovering and under stress. then my job started to get stressful with the holidays coming up so i was working long hours. then i moved into my new home at the end of november. then my job started becoming even more stressful when the holidays were upon us. my parents are barely following the “you know what” guidelines, which worries me a lot. in the beginning of December, i got diagnosed with ADHD and started medicine for it, which is known for decreasing appetite. basically, i’ve been very stressed which makes my anxiety skyrocket and my depression worse. 

i’ve never had this happen to me for so long before (longest maybe a day or two when depressed), but i have not had an appetite since mid october. i am hungry and want to eat, but when i try to find something, it makes me feel physically sick thinking about eating. i’ve thrown up just from taking a couple bites before because my appetite is so non existent my throat closes up and i just can’t do it. i have to get high to eat. i hate it. especially because i can’t be high during work, so most of the time i don’t even eat until around dinner time. it’s so draining and frustrating, which i’m sure makes things worse. 

i’m really truly at my breaking point and i don’t know what to do. i was slightly overweight before, and now with the weight i have lost in the past couple months i am on the lower end of normal weight. and i stopped working out all together because i started to feel woozy afterwards. so the weight loss is just from simply not eating as much as i need to. i believe i am unintentionally starving myself. i feel my relationship with food getting worse and worse and i’m scared this will escalate into an actual eating disorder (if i don’t already have one?). 

i don’t know if this is some kind of eating disorder as i WANT to eat. so badly. but it seems to be mentally impossible unless i’m high. i hate it so much. i cry almost everyday from it. please, any and all advice would be so appreciated. i don’t know what to do. i’m desperate.",Request: No appetite since mid-October.

When the pandemic started, things got worse where I was consistently putting in 60-70 mile weeks of running without rest days, though my restrictive eating improved because I started to “accept” that it was okay to indulge a bit when burning 900+ calories per day.

Just over a month ago I had to stop running due to an overuse injury, and to “make up” for it, I’ve been consistently working out (no-impact Pilates, barre, indoor biking) for 2 hours a day. The problem is, I definitely don’t think I’m burning as many calories as before but my food intake hasn’t decreased and I’m starting to feel extremely stressed and anxious to the point that I re-downloaded MyFitnessPal. I’ve tried to tell myself that the muscular definition I’ve put on since the injury is a good thing, but I can feel that I’m on the verge of relapsing into restrictive dieting. I haven’t gained a lot of weight since I generally eat healthy foods, but for the first time since my initial experience with a restrictive ED, I’ve become determined to go back to being underweight. I am bothered by the fact that my leggings almost fit properly again (no longer loose), but I am aware that this is unhealthy and I genuinely hate that my brain thinks this way.

My boyfriend is currently living in a college home with his close friends and the culture of the house is not the healthiest :( I know they're all broke college students but they seriously are living in the worst conditions... the fridge is full of moldy food and the kitchen is all broken and barely works and they don't really cook much other than mac and cheese or the occasional ramen. They drink a couple of times a week and just sort of chill all day because they're graduating college this semester.

My boyfriend especially has been putting on a little bit of weight this year and I still think he is well within the healthy range, but it's clearly making him insecure. For example, yesterday I was at his house all day and all he had was a ramen packet and some shrimp and later in the night, he had a can of Truly with his friends :( That is not enough food to sustain anyone and it's seriously unhealthy. I even ordered extra food in and hoped he would eat some but he didn't :/ I went to bed first and noticed he wasn't next to me and then when he came back he told me he went to work out :( After that, I could hear his stomach grumbling all night and it was seriously breaking my heart. This has also been going on since like the summer.

I spend a lot of time with him so I see him not eat a single meal until like 7pm and then he will eat and complain about how bloated he is and how he wishes he didn't eat so much. I'm really getting worried about him and I don't know how to express it because he's not taking it seriously at all! Yesterday I sort of put my foot down and told him it's seriously upsetting me and I need him to eat but I don't know if this was the best move or if that's how these things are to be handled. When I look online for resources most of them tell me to just sit down and talk to him or speak to a family member but these aren't really applicable to the situation because 1. his family comes from a culture that doesn't believe in such things 2. he is not taking it seriously enough to have a genuine conversation.

I'm just so worried about him... I really don't know how to get through to him that not only is this super damaging to his health but he also won't really be meeting his fitness goals if he doesn't eat enough food or protein!!!

Firstly, I (36F) know logically I’m not “overweight” but I feel that I am (5’4, weighing between 53 and 59kg, it fluctuates a lot).  I feel like I look overweight and unattractive.  I exercise frequently, and if I don’t exercise for some reason then I feel like I don’t “deserve” to eat at all for the day (like I haven’t earned the calories).  I’ll avoid food for as long as possible but usually cave in the evening when I decide I don’t care what people think about how I look.  And then of course I get an immediate attack of the guilts about what I have just eaten and vow not to do it again.

If I don’t exercise, I am in a foul mood all day.  I will often exercise even if injured or sick.

Whenever I eat anything it is always in the context of “is it worth the calories” so eating out / having nice things is very stressful because it has to be super special to justify having it - and of course not everything is as nice as it looks.

So I could never eat some vegetables. At first my parents thought its a phase as a kid, cause u know, they dont like to eat their veggies.

When i was 12 we went to the doctors because i have hairloss and my parents said its lack of vitamins. My doctor didnt think it could be that but it actually was, so when we got the results we were called back. We just got told its probably just a phase and when i grow up its gone.

Disclaimer: This is my first post on Reddit, ever. I tried to find a post that was similar to my issue so that I might not have to ask everybody the same question, but I could not find something that helped me. If you think there is a post that could help, please let me know!  

Hi folx.  I have read some of the posts here while trying to figure out my own issue and I just wanted to say that I love each and every one of you, and I hope to support everyone on the road to recovery or at least understanding.  

I would like to try to make a long story short but that feels difficult to do in this post.  I am a 22-year-old college student that rents and lives alone. Simply due to the nature of life, the friends I have are in different states for college, I only see my family once a week, and I do not have much social interaction outside of seeing my coworkers because of COVID.  This is not to say I don’t have a support system, but rather that I am just not physically with others often.

I have dealt with disordered eating for a great deal of my life. I could not say for sure but I believe the problem is truly began around the time that I was 12 or 13 years old.  I became a vegetarian at that age for the health benefits. However this was a mixed signal; the health benefits of reducing possible heart problems (common in my family) as well as weight loss.  I have received mixed signals and comments on my body ever since I was young (obviously I wish nobody had said anything at all).  At some point during high-school I silently struggled with anorexia.  The road to recovery was extremely difficult because I was alone, and today I still struggle with disordered eating it, however for the most part I feel that I have a healthy perception of my body.  

When I turned 17 I started smoking p*t and that truly helped with regulating my appetite and mood (which ties into my appetite).  Now that I am an adult and it is legal in my state, I have gotten myself a medical card.  I used smoking as a crutch to regulate my eating for a long spell, but I am realizing that I often lose my appetite to stress and I do not eat when I need to.  Even if I have smoked, I still do not want to eat even if I feel hungry.  This is not because I am actively telling myself that I do not want to eat, but my body does not feel like eating. I know that it’s not really conveying that, and that it does need food, but that’s what it feels like.

This is where my problem really comes into play.  Whenever I am alone, which is pretty much all of the time, it is not that I forget to eat but I simply do not force myself to do so. It’s like it’s pointless to eat because there’s nobody to eat with me. As if somebody needs to watch me consume so that I can enjoy eating.  And this is where it becomes extremely pathetic to me.  Unless I am at my parents house to do laundry and they are cooking food that they sit in front of me, or if my boyfriend is home from college and wants to eat food with me, I do not eat that much.  I simply do not find it enjoyable. Even if the meal is easy like a protein bar or a protein shake, I don’t want it. Putting anything into my body feels like a chore and it feels unnatural. Sometimes I feel guilty about eating when I’m alone and I don’t know why.  It scares me because this happens often, pretty much any time I feel stress (which is often - I do exercise, meditation, and write in my journal to help release stress, but I feel stress heavily all of the time anyway).  

The problem is that my entire journey with food has been invisible to others and I am always too afraid and ashamed to ask for help.  If anyone has any kind of advice for regulating of food schedule when you live alone and are alone but really enjoy eating with others, I would appreciate it. It took a lot to post this and I feel like crying.",Request: Struggling to eat consistently when alone,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/l3n2nm/request_struggling_to_eat_consistently_when_alone/,1611461779.0,2021-01-23 17:16:19
166,EDPostRequests,1611443769,l3n2jf,3,"I've always struggled with health issues from an early age, and I have a condition that causes me to be extremely sick frequently. I've had to structure my whole life around taking the right medications, eating the right foods, sleeping at the right times, and so much more, but even then, I still become sick, and I've always had a hard time accepting that this is beyond my control. As soon as I realized that none of my peers went through the same thing, I tried to hide it as best I could, and I would do anything to stop an attack, even if that meant not eating for days. 

My chronic illness causes my weight to fluctuate with severe episodes, and I would often be hospitalized because I needed fluids. As a result, my body fat was very low, even when I increased my muscle mass, so I would often find myself looking in the mirror to check what I looked like. My doctors were concerned, so they told me to gain more weight, but they always blamed my inability to gain weight on my conditions. 

I went through a very traumatic experience because I kept having my medications switched, and I experienced so many side effects. Some medications made me feel so out of it that I would forget everything I did that day. I would be driving somewhere and I'd forget where I was going, and where I had been before, so I would have to call my parents for help. Some medications triggered my epilepsy, so I was afraid to leave my dorm because I didn't want to fall and hurt myself. I also didn't want to scare the people around me by having an attack. I ended up controlling my food more because I thought that made me feel better. If I had just been honest with my doctors and told them why I couldn't eat enough, I would have been able to stay on my previous medications that had been working. 

I've denied my obsession with controlling my food for too long. I can't eat at restaurants anymore, even if they cater to my dietary needs. I make myself fast for multiple days before events or special occasions. I have managed to reach a healthy weight, but I still suffer from attacks, and sometimes I binge eat after I fast for a long time. After I binge eat I start exercising a lot more, and sometimes I hurt myself from over exercising. 

I weigh all of my food and fill out a spreadsheet tracking calories, nutrients, my weight, all of the medications I took, and how I slept every day. My doctors applaud me for being responsible, but I don't think this is healthy. I do go to therapy, but I've never opened up to any of my therapists. I've never opened up to anyone about this.

Im in a stage where id say im (almost) past my eating disorder

Anyways  So now when i eat, some days it does and sometimes it doesnt it feels  like im never getting full, allways hungry even if i eat until i get too  tired of eating to continue (trust me i have a strong self force  mentality).

So i wonder, does this happen to any of you too?

I  am a 18 year old cisgender male, and I am in a relationship with a 17  year old transgender male. His issues with his gender and dysphoria  contribute to his struggles with eating and dont do him any good  service. I can help him with his dysphoria, and make him feel better  about himself in that sense, and have asked him honestly about this. He  says that I am very helpful and help him to get over this.

However,  he is currently going through a spell of eating very little, and I dont  understand how to help. It is rare that he will be able to eat totally  care free, and more often than not will be struggling to some extent.  However it is rarely as bad as it is now. Other than a cracker and  (minimal) cheese that he had yesterday, he ingested 0 calories;  including drinks. For the past week, he has practically eaten nothing at  all other than one day where I was with him and got him to eat a hot  sausage roll, relatively comfortably, and then when he went home he had  to eat some roast that his mum had cooked for him. He ate about xxxx calories (still low) that day and was extremely distressed as a result. This is so  difficult for me to see, as someone who had never really consciously  struggled with eating before as I know even the average, suggested  amount is still much more than that. I dont understand how to help.

I  have looked up what to say to people with eating disorders (as I am  pretty sure he has one, as much as he is not diagnosed) and I already do  alot of what is suggested. I very frequently tell him how proud I am of  him when he makes any progress, I tell him how handsome he is, I tell  him I love him, and I make sure he knows that I'm with him throughout  his struggles and i wont give up on him. He tells me about how much this  help but it's incredibly difficult for me when I see no actual  differnece in the way he is eating. He also obsessively counts calories,  and cant eat anythign without knowing how many calories are in it. Even  when he can only get a rough number, it stresses him out very much.  Seeing him do this to himself hurts alot and I cant really watch it.

He  went out to run a few miles today and I tried to get him not to as I  know it cannot be good to exert yourself when you havent been eating.  However he still did it and I am worried about him. He already has  issues with his body (ribs (from binding), back problems, and heart pain  as he was not getting heart checkup on a medication he was on, when he  was supposed to).

I never get  angry with him, as much as I feel it in Myself sometimes. I worry that  sometimes i come across as annoyed and stress him out more than i need  to, and i worry ahour that but cant really help it. i asked him and he  says that that's not true, and he only sees concern, which he  understands. however I dont know how true this is.

He  has experience in helping people with eating problems and always wants  to see them get better, and has acknowledged that if we were to swap  shoes, he would be very worried about me and would see it as a problem.  However he doesnt do the same for himself, and cant seem to. it makes me  very upset..

I find this very  difficult to cope with sometimes and it would be too much for me if I  didnt think he would get better. but seeing the positive effects I do  have on him mean the world to me and to see him get truly better one day  would mean more to me than anything else. i have already seen some  effects I've had and it makes me very happy. times like these are very  difficult though, and I dont know what to do. That's why I am here, to  ask for advice on how to deal with this. All I want to do is see him get  better, and not put a foot wrong by him.

Everything has actually been going very well, until I was confronted with the fact I need to eat more in this process. Seems obvious, but it’s very difficult for me to do. My therapist gave me a gentle warning that with the new diet and exercise plan, I will likely go through a period of weight gain before I build muscle. I’m absolutely terrified of this stage. My biggest fear for last five years has been gaining weight. I just want to know if anyone has gone through this? And if so, how did you deal with it? How long did it last?

182,EDPostRequests,1611313264,l2lgay,3,"I’ve been struggling with eating out of the trash for the past few years now. I’ve never opened up about it because I feel **embarrassed and ashamed.** If I told anyone, they’d think I’m dirty and gross. 

My thinking why this could be disordered eating/pica is because I eat from the trash in secrecy, and I know eating in secrecy is a common symptom in other eating disorders. I also feel like the food ""doesn’t count"" from the trash and thus I’ll eat it. I contracted parasites two or three times and I honestly think it’s from eating garbage. 

However, I could see this as being just a ""bad habit"" (and thus not disordered eating/pica) since I only eat things that are *technically* edible. I eat ice sometimes, but I eat a lot of expired/spoiled/raw food too. I eat ""normal"" (still ""good"" as in not expired or spoiled) food out of the trash, too. 

I don’t know how to find a doctor for this. The main reason I ask this sub is because it’s an eating habit, and thus could be disordered eating. I can’t pass the online eating disorder screening tests because my problem isn’t rooted in body image. I feel like because it’s not one of the major eating disorders, a dietitian wouldn’t be interested in helping me. 

Just to clarify because I think it’s important given this topic: my financial situation has no correlation whatsoever to eating out of the trash. I can thankfully afford food and I grew up in a family where I, thankfully, didn’t have to worry about when my next meal would be.

183,EDPostRequests,1611313147,l2lf34,4,"I (16f) haven't been diagnosed with an eating disorder but I think I might have anorexia. I have realized my relationship with food is not normal and I'm trying to recover. For the last year, I was constantly thinking about food, I restricted food intake and I lost a significant % of my body weight and my period. I was also over-exercising. I'm already a competitive runner, but I would make sure I did at least one extra workout a day on top of what I was already doing. Sometimes it's about body image and nutrition, but it's also a way to punish myself, to be in control of something in my life, and to see how much pain I could put myself through, which would make me feel better. I've tried talking to my parents about this but they don't think I have an eating disorder. My mom thinks I'm just being picky and not being grateful for the food they buy. She also thinks I can't be sick because although I was underweight, my physical appearance never got to the point where I looked anorexic and needed to be hospitalized. My dad thinks my behavior around food is fine and I'm actually being healthier. It hasn't occurred to him that I might have an ed. My dad constantly tells me how I need to exercise daily because children need exercise and I'm young so my body can handle it. I've said that I don't think that's best for my health (since I'm trying to get my period back), but he tells me I need to get my information from better sources instead of making stuff up and assuming I’m right. Sometimes his comments trigger my restrictive behavior, but when I tell him, he thinks I'm being problematic and not making sense. I also tried to tell them that it's not always about food, which they thought I was making up to cause drama. They also always somehow make it about them. My mom said that I need to stop being so selfish. She said that when I starve myself, I’m only putting her in pain because she was the one who gave birth to me, so I should be grateful for the life she gave me instead of making her watch me not eat. My dad says that I need to stop my immature behavior and manage my emotions better because when I refuse to eat and I’m always upset, it’s ruining the household environment and my relationship with them. I feel like nobody understands what I'm going through or wants to understand. I've been feeling pretty worthless and like I have no hope for recovery. I’m pretty much always sad and I’m pretty negative, which my parents get mad at because they think I’m exaggerating my problems and I have nothing to be unhappy about.

A few days ago, I tried talking about this to them again, but they didn’t understand and they ended up only getting mad at me for my behavior. I’ve realized that they likely won't every understand and my eating disorder recover is my responsibility so I can’t expect my parents to help me when it’s my problem.

She is overweight and wants to lose weight and be healthier. In the beginning, she asked me for tips and stuff as I have been struggling to maintain healthy habits in my recovery which I happily oblige her in because I was genuinely excited that she wanted to take better care of her body. It started with me helping her build an exercise and nutrition regime that is sustainable and would feed her body well since she is vegan. The last thing I told her is to be kind to her body and herself because weightloss is not linear and her goal should be health and not a scale number. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, since we had to separate from COVID, it seems like she took the inch of my advice, tossed half, and ran a mile with the rest. Every week since December she tells me how much weight she lost and how much more she needs to lose, and what she ate for that day, and what she plans to eat. And the exercise and diet advice I gave? She does intense workouts daily and every week she has a new fad diet (juice diet, going keto, zero carb, fruits and veg only, etc) sending me pictures of her goal bodies, and gets upset if she doesn't lose as many lbs as she wanted for that week. She's lost a lot of weight since August and was livid because she only lost a few  lbs in January. I feel like this is all my fault. On one hand, I did encourage her in these habits and congratulated her as she was losing weight from being consistent but I didn't know that that was what she was doing until almost the end of December. 

I know since I'm in recovery for EDs that there's nothing you can say to someone in the throes of it that will change them, and they have to make that decision for themself, so I've been trying to get her to consider her health more than the scale number. I ask her to consider how she feels about and after the food she eats (or doesn't), I remind her that yo-yo dieting and fad diets are ineffective, I tell her to eat if she is hungry and listen to her body and eat, I tell her to focus on another benchmark than the scale, like an increase in stamina or better sleep or SOMETHING, but it seems like I won't be able to get through to her. The more she talks the more guilty I feel for starting this, and just her intense restrictions and how she talks about the food and her body image is so triggering to me I can't take it.

however i stopped intermittent fasting when i was going through a hard time and turned to food for comfort. food has never been a necessity to survive for me, it was something i needed to feel good.
if i am awfully full, i dont want to leave the house. i refuse to leave the house unless my stomach feels completely empty, so it’s easier to suck in. and that’s where delaying my first day of school comes in..
i ate a lot this weekend because my friend came over for a sleepover... and school started yesterday.

This story is not going to be applicable to everyone, but it may help some of you. 
TLDR; Had an ED (bulimia) for 8 years as a teenager, have struggled with weight since. Turns out I have ADHD. My mindset has changed COMPLETELY since.
I'm 37/F. I have struggled with my relationship with food for most of my life. At 9 I wrote in my diary that I thought I was fat and compared myself to other girls. From 13 - 22 I had bulimia, I went to counselling and worked through a lot of stuff. Though I didn't engage in such harmful behaviours any more since then there's always been this fixation.
In recent years I am pretty sure I would fall under the category of BED. My weight fluctuated all the time. It would start to go up and I'd be stressed but I always needed to be in what I thought of as ""the zone"" in order to start a diet. So I would start a diet and it would go SUPER well for 2 weeks, maybe 3, sometimes. But the struggle was immense. 
With diets even if they were going well I didn't seem to get the same dopamine kick as it continued. The initial high of my progress was not enough to encourage me to continue. I would start snacking more. My weight would start to go back up. Rinse and repeat. I felt like a constant failure. I thought there was something inherently weak in me. 
The thing I couldn't understand was how different it felt now to when I was a teenager and had an ED. As a teen I lacked self esteem and my ED was a way for me to cope with stress. As an adult, I'm actually very happy &amp; much more confident. I didn't understand why I had this ""need"" to snack all the time. 
In December last year I got diagnosed with ADHD. My oldest brother has ADHD and he told me 5 years ago he thought I might have it. I laughed and told him that was ridiculous. I compared myself to him and what I thought ADHD was. I was completely wrong. ADHD is much broader than the general public are led to believe and it also presents itself very differently in women. Women are much less likely to get a diagnosis than men because of it - most women being adults by the time they get it. 
People who have ADHD have much lower dopamine production the neurotypical people &amp; can often look for these dopamine kicks elsewhere. For me it was food &amp; especially sugary/carb rich food. 
Research indicates that adolescent females with ADHD are 3.6 times more likely to develop an ED and 5.6 times more likely to develop bulimia nervosa.
In conclusion I'm not trying to say that my ADHD caused the ED or that it was a magic cure but it's helped me to understand myself better &amp; thus begin to overcome once and for all this fixation with food. 
I would never in a million years have suspected that I have ADHD and statistically speaking there must be a small percent of you in here that also has it. 
If you relate to what I've said, and you don't have ADHD - that does NOT mean you're a failure. Having an ED is way of coping, it's a very real struggle. It's just a matter of finding out what exactly it is your struggling with. For me I was struggling with all the negative effects of ADHD but not understanding WHY.

201,EDPostRequests,1612209008,lac92n,3,"My daughter is an 18f and I've started to notice a pattern with her eating. She eats a huge amount of food and then a bit later announces that she has to ""poop"". She then proceeds to the bathroom for awhile, then comes out with a red face and red knuckles saying she ""feels like she lost 2 pounds"".

Honestly, I wouldn't have thought anything of it if I hadn't noticed a pattern and  if I wasn't recovering from an ED myself. She's literally doing the exact same things I've done in the past and it breaks my heart. 

I'm a little concerned that my husband/her father might be exacerbating the issue, he's tall and eats more than what would be considered normal. I say this because I relapsed in the beginning of our relationship due to the fact that his love language is food. We had to make some not-so-easy adjustments but we've gotten to a healthy place where I'm able to stay balanced.

That being said, there is a thirteen year difference between me and my husband so I'm closer to my daughters age, but I'm at a total loss for how to approach the subject with either of them. When I was deep in my ED I didn't want to talk about it and I would lash out if anyone even broached the subject. 

I see myself in her and I don't want to cause more stress but I also don't want to pretend like everything is okay when it's clearly not.

I feel like I'm skating on thin ice and I'd really appreciate any thoughts on how I could possibly begin to approach this subject with her.

202,EDPostRequests,1612180962,la1kwh,6,"So from 12 to 18 years old, I struggled. I had a friend who was anorexic and often hospitalised so our friendship, while we liked each other greatly, was toxic as we would just....  encourage each other. I almost got hospitalised for ED and other mental issues often, but always got away with it. I reached not to purge for a year, then at 17, relapsed. I had came out as trans and my mom didn't got it, school was stressful and so I purged. My mom caught me and told me she would hospitalised me if I kept doing it. It did work. 

Now at 22, I struggled, but I was overall ok. Still had a lot of comportements from that, but nothing as dangerous as it had been. I was proud. But then, lockdown. Before that, I would walk, climbed the 5 floors to my class and all so I would have a low weight, but not too low. But with the lockdown and more recently, the curfew, I started eating a lot more. I work in animation and would spend my days in front of my computer on works. Staying until 6 am, then going to sleep and waking up at 12 only to go to my computer until 6 to 8 am. 

During all this, I was also secretly going to appointment to start my transition as non-binary. I gained not that much of weight, really. I'm not even at my healthy weight, only a few pounds under, but it's the highest I've ever been and my chin is not so slim anymore. It scared me. Then when I got my ok to start T, I came out to my family and it didn't go well. They still misgender me (They/them, but we speak french and in french everything is gendered so I told them to be a neutral as possible or to use masculine pronouns) and my dysphoria got way worse. As well as my body image. 

I binge and binge and feel bad. I started exercising again and try to just have a healthier lifestyle as much as I could (I still do 1 to 3h of walking per day since the start of the lockdown), but these days, it's becoming more and more in my head. The urge to purge, the urge to restrained, to exercise, everything. My two classmates I worked nightly with last semester had lost so much weight because of the stress and all I felt was guilt and disgust that I, in the other hand, had gained weight.

The only way that I've found to keep this in check as an adult is to keep track of everything that I eat for a few months (along with exercise) to get to a healthy weight. I stay at a healthy weight for some amount of time (currently four months) and then eventually things fall apart and it seems like I get into a frame of mind where I really want to eat. I find myself thinking about food all the time, mapping out in my mind what meals I am going to eat next.

207,EDPostRequests,1612150074,l9tn86,23,"so i (19F) have been roommates since last september with this girl (19) and we bonded instantly. we hang out almost everyday, play board games a lot, and watch tv. when i first moved in, i noticed a sign on her wall saying “eat x meals a day! idc if you’re not hungry” and i thought nothing of it considering i struggled with appetite loss the previous year of school due to poor mental health and i thought it was something along those lines. nothing serious right?

about a month into our friendship, i started to notice odd behavior. she would eat a snack, for example a smoothie, and then starve the rest of the day. i would ask if she wants to come eat with me or our friends and she would say she isn’t hungry or that she’s full. i’d ask her to come just to hang out while i get food if she doesn’t feel like eating. sometimes she’ll say no, sometimes she’ll say yes. it’s a gamble. there are rare times in which she will eat if she comes with me so i make a point to ask her to come. 

she works out excessively with resistance bands and weights and always makes comments about how her breasts/rear aren’t big enough, she’s not proportionate, and that she needs to get fit. we’re around the same weight- average for our age. (not that it matters, but idk if that’s something i should add).

there are days where she doesn’t want to be around anyone. she’ll shut down. sometimes she’ll go on walks or sit in her bed on her computer. if i tell her something to start a conversation, she’ll just say “uh huh” or “that’s good.” and if i ask her to hang out she’ll just say no

she has been exhibiting these behaviors for months now. i know she struggles with low self esteem and past trauma. her family and friends back home joke about how she doesn’t eat. it doesn’t seem to bother her though as she brings up the jokes to me and laughs about how they ‘called her out.’

anyways yesterday she ate something from the supermarket and it made her stomach hurt. she kept talking about how much she didn’t want it inside her anymore. she asked me if i knew of anything that could induce vomiting. i declined and said there’s no safe way to induce vomiting because the acid burns your throat either way. i went back in my room where our friends were and we continued our conversation. a bit later she goes to the bathroom with what looks like a spoon or a toothbrush and locks the door. my heart sunk and i tried to think about something else. until i heard it. it was violent and prolonged. my friends and i looked at each other and one of them mouthed to me asking if my roommate was okay. i said it’s fine. she came out of the bathroom a while later and was shut down and reserved for the rest of the night.

normally, she’ll lock herself in the bathroom for hours. sometimes 3-4 hours at a time and play music. i have no idea what she does. shes not always in a bad mood when she does this, it’s basically routine now. the bathroom is pretty acoustic so you can hear pretty much everything. but when she goes in, i only hear music. sometimes shuffling around. this time was different though. it was the only time i heard her purging

while we are close, our relationship isn’t at a stage where we can be completely vulnerable to each other. she’s opened up, i’ve opened up but it’s not super deep or raw emotion you know? and i know she hates exposing herself in that way. so bringing this behavior up is not something i have considered. however she did mention something once on a late night with one other friend. she said that she has a reason for not eating but then the subject was changed so it wasn’t much of a conversation. that’s why i think it might be an ED

i know it’s not my business, but i can’t help but feel torn up by this. she’s my friend and i love her a lot. i would hate to think i could’ve done something with the information ive analyzed. 

in high school i had a couple friends with ED. mostly restrictive eating and starving, and they’d claim it was dietary. back then, i left them alone. until i realized later that their behavior was indeed that of individuals with EDs. so i don’t want to be a bystander to this. i want to help. but i’m not sure how. 

ive brought up the fact that i go to our school’s therapy and i always talk to our group about how beneficial it is and how i believe everyone should go at least once since it’s free. i asked my roommate if she’d be interested and she was very apprehensive. recently, she told me she’s open to the idea but needs my help in signing up. i told her i could help with whatever she needs but she hasn’t brought it up since. should i offer it again?

her parents don’t know the extent of her behavior and neither do any of our friends. i don’t want to air out her business to the group. is there anything i can do that isn’t too pushy or prodding? or makes her distance herself from me? i want to do all i can, but i also want to respect her privacy",Request: i think my roommate/friend might have an ED. how should i approach?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/l9tn86/request_i_think_my_roommatefriend_might_have_an/,1612168074.0,2021-01-31 21:27:54

218,EDPostRequests,1612050912,l8zah2,4,"My roommate has some strange behaviors, and this week it occurred to me that some of them might be indicative of disordered eating. I've been reading about ED, especially bulimia, and the resources for family and friends to ask/support those who are struggling. The problem is that I'm not sure if I'm reading way too much into things, and that we aren't close so it doesn't seem appropriate for me to offer support even if I notice more potential signs. 
When she first moved in, she said she has dietary restrictions and had been out of school for the last semester because of health issues. We assumed something like celiacs, IBS, etc. When we offered to include her in group dinners, one of my roommates asked what she needs to avoid and she said ""it's personal."" We dropped it and were confused but didn't want to press her. 
Why I think she might struggle with ED, and bulimia specifically:
- Regularly takes long showers, like at least 40 minutes, but up to 1 1/2 hours. I always thought it was odd but yesterday after dinner she took her second long shower of the day (the first one was after breakfast) and it rang a bell for me. 
- Only buys certain types of healthy foods, portions most things out on a scale, and writes caloric content + protein/fats on everything she freezes for later. *(QUESTION: Would this indicate restrictive eating or a recovery tactic to make sure she gets enough nutrients/doesn't binge?)
- Wears baggy shorts and jackets every day (I didn't read into this before but it was listed on several sites as a possible sign of ED)
- Newly clogged sink drain in the bathroom she uses (this happened soon after she moved in)
I haven't noticed any physical signs like bruised knuckles, red eyes, etc, and I don't share a bathroom with her. But now that I have read more, I will definitely be paying more attention. 

I feel like it's not my business at all, but I am definitely concerned. We are not close, partly because she's new to the apartment (we have made an effort to include her in things, but I don't know if she's that interested). Is there a point at which I should reach out, and if so, what should I say? I'd like to offer support or help her get help if she needs it, but it feels like complete overstepping. If I noticed any more signs, I was thinking I could leave her a note (rather than sitting her down and talking face-to-face) so that she could process it and ignore me if it is a boundary violation for me to ask. Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated!!",Request: I'm concerned that my new roommate has bulimia/ED,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/l8zah2/request_im_concerned_that_my_new_roommate_has/,1612068912.0,2021-01-30 17:55:12

I was wondering what to consider for recovery. What does it mean to be recovered? Is it steps that I’ve taken, mindset, physical health? What is recovery?",Request: Recovery Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/l8zack/request_recovery_questions/,1612068902.0,2021-01-30 17:55:02
220,EDPostRequests,1612050892,l8za8g,4,Has anyone else had nausea as a result of starving yourself? I am recovering now and haven’t starved myself in a few months but when I was the nausea was really bad. It’s better now but still is hard to bear sometimes. What did you do other than eat normally? I told my doctor that I had nausea and was taking pills to stop acid buildup because naturally i didn’t tell them what it was.,Request: Consistent nausea?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/l8za8g/request_consistent_nausea/,1612068892.0,2021-01-30 17:54:52
