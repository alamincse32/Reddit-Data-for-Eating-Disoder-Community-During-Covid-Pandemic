Sometimes it would only be a  pound or few ounces of difference but I remember how different I felt after I got weighed. If I weighed a few ounces more I felt gross and unlike me. I know it’s not exactly the same but still. Now that I don’t have to be weighed weekly I feel so much better, like I’m not just a number. It’ll pass. Just try going for a walk to ease your mind. We’re not just numbers. ",alexisvaldo,1531542480.0,2018-07-13 23:28:00,"I’m sorry you’re feeling this way.. it’s not fun to feel like you don’t belong in your own body. Its painful because you don’t want to look at yourself in photos, mirrors, on the scale, anywhere. Ultimately you have to be honest with yourself and the stage you’re currently in on your life. Just remember it’s not permanent and if you’re not happy with how things are you can change. You just have to take the first step. Don’t think about the time it will take. Just take things one day at a time and know that each day you’ll be better than the one before and closer to the finish line. ",,,,,,,,,,,,

Driving around. Going to a park. Calling up a friend and talking. Volunteering. These are all huge helps to keep me from thinking about how much I hate my body.",wonderwomxn,1530988788.0,2018-07-07 13:39:48,"(Sorry in advance for a long comment. Tl;dr: Talking to someone helps. Feel free to drop me a message if you need someone to vent to.) 

You’re not alone &lt;3 I’ve been going through a similar time right now, and it sucks because after trying so hard to recover for a good few months, it feels like the ED voice came back with a vengeance but my body’s just not doing what I want it to. Idk if that makes any sense. I know you said you want to push on, but if you have someone (family, s/o, therapist, friend) who knows about your ED, I strongly recommend talking to them. Even though you desperately want to hide it and crave the security of slipping back into old habits. Vocalizing your feelings and knowing that somebody will be looking out for you (and can even validate you in terms of helping you see how you really look) can be so powerful in giving you back some agency. 

That being said, I know that sometimes turning back towards recovery is hell. If you need someone to vent to (especially someone who can’t judge you personally or hold you accountable or whatever), please feel free to message me. I can’t promise helpful advice but sometimes it helps just to know someone out there can empathize with you. ",whtvrnosilla,1531002392.0,2018-07-07 17:26:32,"&gt;*it's really hard when it feels having a better body image means gaining weight, even though I'm at a healthy weight. It's extra hard when it feels like the only reason I'm at a healthy weight is because of my eating disorder.*

Wow, I am right there with you. I've been hovering at a borderline healthy weight, and I feel like my disordered behaviors are the only reason I'm there. I definitely agree that it's hard, especially since a little voice is convincing you that you only look good because of the disorder, but that's not true (and I'm trying to remind myself of that). I also try to remember that my body *needs* food, and that any disordered thought is just that: disordered. Gaining weight doesn't equate to a bad body, either, even though it may feel like it! 

Like someone else said, I'd definitely recommend talking to a family member, friend, or calling a previous therapist. Just having someone know what you're dealing with can be so reassuring. I know you said you've only wanted avocado toast, but maybe try and find some other recipes that sound good - if it's avocado you're craving, find some others that use it as an ingredient! I've found that I'm a lot more willing to eat if I enjoy cooking the meal.

Anyway, it's good that you know these feelings will calm down in the future. Until then, I'm definitely supporting you and empathizing. ♥",,,,,,,,

I would recommend talking to your parents about what is going on, especially considering you said he has a past history of depression. I wish you luck.",spoonsareuseless,1530884257.0,2018-07-06 08:37:37,"It does very much sound like an ED, and the thing about eating disorders are that they make you a liar. So at this point, even if he says he’s doing fine and whatnot, he’s seriously at risk. Bulimia can erode your teeth, permanently mess with your metabolism, cause your stomach to tear, and all types of other nasty stuff. Even if he doesn’t want help, he needs it. Actually, especially if he doesn’t want help. 
The best option would be to try to get him in counseling. Definitely tell your parents too, but he needs mental help from a professional.",Evorum,1530885707.0,2018-07-06 09:01:47,"As a mostly recovered bulimic male, who mainly suffered from severe control issues and body dysmorphia, this sounds very similar to what I started out like.  I've also had dysthymia for as long as I can remember, with respites here and there.  I'm a rock climber btw, which can be very weight conscious as well.  I think the athletic aspect + body image problems really fueled it.  I would first attempt to get on the same page as your brother, whatever that means to you.  You need to both be open and honest with each other or getting to any further step is hard.  He needs to know that he can talk to the people he trusts and not be judged.  You probably won't be able to understand it all.  If you can get him talking about it, then it will probably become apparent to him that he wants to be rid of this vile shit.

The hardest step to recovering from an ED is accepting and admitting you have a problem and want to change. You should be proud of yourself in knowing you’ve taken the first step already.    

In regards to recovery - in my opinion the only thing that has worked for me has been counseling. However, you did mention your mom might not support this course of action so I have to ask how old are you? If you are 18 I would say go ahead and pursue counseling bc yes, it is difficult at first but it sets you up with the skills and more importantly SUPPORT to fight your ED which it sounds like you don’t have rn. I hope this advice helps but feel free to PM me if you ever need support!",luimrt2,1530773224.0,2018-07-05 01:47:04,"As a person in recovery, I do suggest you speak to a counselor so that she can evaluste you and help you get the level of care that you need and a full treatment team if needed. You recognizing you need help is the first step! This is a very difficult battle to over come alone, so I am so happy to know that you are open to getting help. Please message me if you would like to talk or have questions about the recovery process.

Wanting to get better + therapy/treatment is the only thing I’ve ever heard of working, and the sooner you can start therapy the better. It’s hard, but it’s so worth it.

I don’t know if I’ll ever be happy with my body, but I’ve come to accept that it’s okay if it’s not perfect. Lots of people with less-than-perfect bodies are people I love and look up to and admire. If they don’t need to be held to strict standards of beauty, neither do I.",,,,,,,,

I've been in recovery since last year and still go through periods where i relapse depending on my stress levels but i can drag myself out of it normally. My dietitian encourages intuitive eating but also eating whatever i want (to an extent, obviously mcdonalds everyday isn't good for anyone). I think as long as you're not punishing yourself for when you do eat a brownie or something then you're on the right track. Enjoy food and remember a life without treats isn't really living anyway!",invisiblepourlesyeux,1531575346.0,2018-07-14 08:35:46,"I think it’s great that you are noticing those things! I would encourage you to try and challenge those rules a little bit at a time - maybe take 2-3 bites of dessert or add a little bit more topping than is initially comfortable. How often are you chewing and spitting? You might check in with where that’s coming from - is it because you feel like you can’t eat a specific food? Are you still hungry but feel like you’ve eaten enough? You might experiment with what it’s like to swallow some of it and see how you feel &amp; if you are able to tolerate it. Recovery can be a long process. I’ve been recovering for 8ish years and in pretty solid recovery for about 6 and I’m still noticing places where I overcontrol my food - maybe not in a pathological way, but I want to experience as much food freedom as I can. So when I notice those behaviors I just try to take baby steps until I feel a little more comfortable giving up control in that area.",reallyokfinewhatever,1531584047.0,2018-07-14 11:00:47,"At some point, it's important to stop comparing to other people's ""normal"" and find your own comfort level.

In truth, not a single person is the epitome of normal eating--everyone binges sometimes, eats too little sometimes, has unhealthy thoughts or assumptions about food sometimes. The major point is whether those behaviors cause you mental/emotional distress, or affect your health.

I have had an ED for many, many years now. Contrary to most people, I choose to consider myself as always having an ED--even when it is dormant--rather than flip-flopping between ""recovery"" and ""relapse"". This help me, personally, to moderate those in-between times when my thoughts or behaviors may not be 100% healthy, but are also not so distressing to me as to feel that I'm spiraling downward indefinitely.

Point being, it's all up to you--if you feel these thoughts are precursors to more unhealthy behaviors, or if they are upsetting you constantly, then it's worth confronting them and figuring out how to move forward. If you don't feel that your overall health is suffering, and if you feel generally ok with where you're at, then it's also ok to just shrug and let it be.

No one is perfect--in the same way that you can't sustain a life suffering from an ED, you also can't spend your life trying to attain a pristine level of ""normal"" that doesn't exist. Find YOUR normal.",AndyF1069,1531589910.0,2018-07-14 12:38:30,"I was never officially diagnosed either, although there's absolutely zero doubt that I definitely had a disorder. I've spent the last ten years telling people about how I ""used to have"" an eating disorder when talking about certain behavioural things I do. I can't cope without my behaviours as they help me feel safe. Things like dressing a certain way or positioning my body or objects close to me in a certain way. 

My mental health has plummeted over the past 18 months after a mix of multiple deaths, a case of homelessness and a couple of family tragedies not related to the deaths . When I got a place of my own, I registered with the local doctors and have been completely open with all of my anxieties and concerns. She believes I may still have an eating disorder and I've been referred to an eating disorder clinic, but I don't know how long that'll take. I had to consent to it, and it wasn't an instant yes for me. The idea of challenging my own behaviours is a scary one. The idea of not having my safety actions or being pushed into body acceptance is a scary thing, because my brain is conditioned to believe that those things are bad. And logically I can accept that I'll likely be better once these behaviours are challenged, but it's the fear leading up to it that sucks. 

I think most people will have some sort of concern at some point over food. Did I order too much fast food? Should I be having this second helping of cake? That's a lot of beer. And the reverse is true for people trying to be health conscious as far as restricting themselves. 

But I don't believe that people obsess the way that those us of us with poor mental health or conditions obsess, nor do I believe that it restricts their lifestyle or further deteriorates mental health. I spent all of June restricting what I ate. I'd try my damndest to stay under a certain amount of calories (with exceptions for being with friends or family). I wouldn't allow myself any snacks or my favourite comfort foods. I made sure to not buy them just to make sure that I wouldn't give in to temptation. To me, that's me being ""good"" as far as reaching my goals. People with similar concerns might think I did good too. But I think most people would be taken aback and feel it wasn't necessary to restrict so much. And on the flipside, in the past week I've had fast food three times (twice with friends), including last night. Last night was an intense desire with nothing to do with hunger. And I've spent all of today regretting it, and haven't eaten yet (it's 6.30pm) but I will cook myself a meal soon. 

Emotionally, I feel as if I'm trying to take control. Logically, I know that it's unhealthy to restrict and to obsess. That's why I consented to be referred to the eating disorder clinic. As much as I fear it, I would like to get better. It would be nice to leave the house in summer in just a shirt (I literally can't right now). 

You're not alone. I won't advise you on what action to take, that's for you to decide. But I relate to you. Good luck with your recovery and you can get in touch if you wish. ",runningkillskatie,1531629842.0,2018-07-14 23:44:02,I’ve been in recovery since 2012 and after that I see had some ED mindsets but over time they faded away.

Not a lot of people do that.

Do research on how to support a person with an eating disorder. A lot of the time people want to be there but they end up saying/doing the wrong things. It's not their fault, it's just that EDs are a very warped disorder and you have to tread carefully. 

Care packages are a good idea. Don't make comments about her appearance in general or focus on her weight at all even if it's a positive remark. Simply remind her you love her and are there to offer support. Let her vent and don't pass on judgement on whatever she shares with you even if it's difficult not to.",,,,,,,,
