Has anyone developed any problems with their skin, hair or body hair from this disorder?

I somehow have ‘strong’ hair and nails that grow long very easily, but it’s EXTREMELY brittle. My hair is dry as hell no matter what treatments I try. My nails are always chipping at the edges too.

I also have a lot of excess hair on my face that I don’t remember being there when I was younger. I noticed it develop when my eating disorder first kicked in at 16 (now 24) and I don’t remember noticing it when I was briefly overweight (17-19). I get dark hairs on my chin I have to pluck out all the time too and I’m unsure as to why, I haven’t noticed them anywhere else on my body.

My skin is also really dry and rough most of the time, I always have some spots on my face but never had a problem with full blown acne.

My questions are:

• are these all likely to be eating disorder related?

• has anyone experienced something similar?

• is this reversible or treatable and if so, how?",EatingDisorders,Request: Hair and skin problems?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fsn517/request_hair_and_skin_problems/,1585716168.0,2020-03-31 17:42:48

3,EDPostRequests,1585692591,fsmiuq,"Hi all.

Some background: I have been calorie conscious since 2nd grade. I am from a family not obsessed with health but obsessed with weight. Even our height wall included weight. Even at these young grade school ages these ""health"" kicks would include full body measurements. I would work out daily and restrictive diet was added into that. 

Then in high school I discovered thermogenics and fat burners. I took more than the instructed doses and this continued through the first half of college, where I made sure to limit calories to a low limit every day.

Between plateauing and an abusive relationship the depression and anxiety then turned into binge eating. I gave up one bad for another. Gained back all I lost plus reinforcements. 

With some help I started to recover a couple years ago. No more fatburners or calorie restrictions but a modified meal plan to at least keep the foods healthy and allow for occasional cheat meals. 

Now in quarantine I'm back in the circumstances that started that first kick way back when and have even started thoughts of limiting food to bites/hr. I'm scared to return but also thinking I would be happier to be that skinny again so what's the harm?

I did end up going to therapy for it for about two years, and it's really helped me for the most part. Food doesn't affect the way I live anymore, I'm 17 now. I honestly feel like I mostly live a normal life because I have reconciled my relationship with eating, I can eat whatever, and not worry about anything.

My problem, though, lies with exercise. Even though I was in therapy for my issues, they mainly focused on my food issues and not my exercise issues. I feel really unbalanced because I feel perfectly fine mentally until it comes to my ""physical health"". And by that I mean any form of exercise

I feel like crying literally any time I work out, I have to stop working out everytime because I feel so awful. It's like the thoughts of back then come to consume every part of my mind and make me want to relapse. Since exercise makes me feel awful, I just stopped exercising period. The most exercise I have probably done in the past two years is walking my dog everyday and running one mile once in a blue moon. 

I want to be able to have a healthy relationship with exercise because I want to make my body stronger and make it look better. There's nothing wrong with it now of course, but not working out has made me very weak, muscle wise. However, every single time I've tried to do a moderate workout like a zoomba class, or like weightlifting, or even just regular old crunches or body exercise, I get intrusive thoughts that completely ruin the rest of the day for me. 

I'm asking if anyone has gone through something similar to what I'm going through? and is there any advice for me so I could finally have a healthy relationship with exercise?

First, I'm in denial about if this is a problem. I'm going ""well I am able to keep my calories up so it's fine"". I think deep down inside me, I know I'm not okay. I'm thinking about food constantly. I'm really struggling with not wanting to eat, even when I'm hungry. I'm calorie counting, which I started because I knew I wasn't eating enough (to force myself to eat more) but now it's devolved and I won't let myself ""overeat"" (calorie goal on this tracker is based on my MBR/activity level and is approximately the correct TDEE, not an ED-warped low calorie goal). But I don't feel like it's ""as bad"" because I am still able to force feed myself. I've read posts on this sub, searching for answers to these questions, and it just feels like I'm not that bad and others deserve the support more. And how do I even figure out what level of support I need? Do I just keep fumbling along until this trigger is gone, and then pick up the pieces?

Second, I don't know how to tell friends and ask for support. We're all stuck at home and video calling and whatnot. I don't want to bring more negativity into their life, and it feels like ""my problem"". I don't know how to tell friends, but I need to, because I'm struggling and need the support. I don't want to talk about it with them, but I simultaneously really want to be able to get this off my chest. At the same time I feel like an imposter using the ED label, because I am not struggling and undereating nearly as much as some folks do.

I would love to hear people's stories and advice on how you've dealt with these issues. Deep down I know I need help. I just don't feel like I am doing badly enough to deserve it.

I also make all my foods by myself to myself and I feel extreme guilt whenever I have to throw food out (since as a kid I got yelled at for never eating my food), so another reason I tend to overeat is so that I finish everything on my plate even when eating feels uncomfortable.

I’ve noticed that the main points made by uploaders and commenters are:
- it helps the uploader keep themselves accountable and track recovery
- those videos don’t have to be made public and could instead be kept as a private journal
- it’s the viewer’s responsibility to judge if they’re okay with watching the video because of the trigger warnings and very blatant ED topic
- the video could come off as a glorification or tutorial
- they make other people with EDs feel less alone
- the thumbnails alone can be triggering

In my case, I don’t like to admit it but I think the videos do more harm. I used to watch restricting videos after binges to try and motivate myself to get back into the restrictive lifestyle out of guilt, but that would always lead to binging videos being recommended which would just reawaken the compulsion. Or I’d use binging videos as a twisted sense of comfort by telling myself “other people binge more than me so this slip up was okay.” I don’t see the point in publicly posting videos that could potentially encourage younger/desperate people or cause relapses, when they can be kept private and achieve the same goal of tracking progress.

25,EDPostRequests,1585161186,fovhb9,"I'm unsure of what to do. I (F24) finally told my bf (M27) of 2 years about my ED of 7 years now. He's my best friend who's so supportive and makes me feel like so loved. We moved in together after a year of doing long distance. I never thought I would tell him about my little secret, I thought it was something I could keep him in the dark about until it eventually went away.

 I get stuck in a pattern: Eat moderate amount of calories a day, lift at the gym 4x a week, don't eat beyond 7pm, and use meds to aid in appetite suppressant. And then there will be one day in the week where I will splurge on to a somewhat normal amount of calories and then try to compensate with restricting and vigorously exercising.
My family have always had their suspicions about my eating patterns but those discussions never got anywhere productive. My childhood best friend is the one I confide in for when I'm especially struggling or when I was successfully able to ""forgive myself"" for overeating.

 Back to my boyfriend, ever since he saw me faint infront of his eyes, he's made more comments geared towards eating, like ""you should eat dinner, sweetie,"" and ""let's fatten you up"".

 But then one night two weeks ago when we got fast food together on the way home from clubbing he said ""This is the first time we got fast food together"" and added ""you eat less than you did before, you're smaller than when we first met"". In the moment, my tipsy self just word vomited ""I've been struggling with an eating disorder for a long time."" I told him for how long and who knew, and all he could say was ""and you waited this long to tell me?""....we never talked about it since, and kinda just carried on like I never told him.

31,EDPostRequests,1584996684,fnrovb,"I don't want to say im feeling hopeless, but I feel like im stuck where I am in terms of recovery and don't know how to move forward. My eating disorder problems started in high school, where i slowly began restricting foods to the point where I developed full on anorexia, and barely ate anything for eight months. Around when all of this started, I began to feel more culturally aware of my surroundings (being a Korean raised in canada) and felt really shameful that my body wasn't like other asians. I was also engaged in a relationship at the time that praised my body for being so thin and 'beautiful',  making it hard to stop my disordered eating. After those eight months, I couldn't stop thinking about food and the urges of food and hated feeling so cold all the time, so I thought I could lessen the restrictions on my 'diet' and eat more. Before I knew it, I was binging on all the foods I could think of and managed to gain back all the weight I tried so hard to loose. I felt and still feel really fat and like I lost control of myself, and for compensation began purging. 

My bulimia has been going on for three years now, and I feel like I've tried everything to stop it. My face looks so bad now because of how swollen it is, my throat always hurts, and I feel like shit because of how I've lost all the self-control and temperance i trained myself to have. Last summer, I use to be throwing up at least five times a day, and was still putting on weight, and started cutting myself to pull myself back together in hopes of getting a reality check. I decided to go to an eating disorder clinic over the summer to finally talk to someone about these problems, but I also knew I would be moving provinces within the next three months because I couldn't stand the thought of putting all my dreams and ambitions aside just because of some fucking stupid eating disorder. Through the clinic I was told my binging was triggered by stress, and so in the summer I started only binging and purging maybe once a week or less, and unconsciously food slipped away from my focus. 

When i entered university after those three months of treatment, I hadn't binged for a couple weeks and was going strong, before all the sudden all I could think about was eating and purging, despite the lack if stress and the fact that I truly am studying something I love. I went to see a therapist for a couple sessions in hopes of stoping the ED because I felt myself swirling out of control, who then told me it was most likely a trauma response that I developed and eating disorder in the first place. I moved provinces because I wanted to follow my dreams but also because my father who I thought the world of had become abusive after he started taking a lot of drugs to cope with the pains he got from working so hard. After my therapist helped me solve some of the issues i buried in myself, I found that my binging and purging stopped in December up until I had to go home for Christmas break, where once again I experienced the rage and anger of my father and the constant fighting and yelling and threats and now I'm nearly back where I started, throwing up once every couple days. I don't know when I feel full anymore, and I feel like I don't have enough self control to stick to a meal plan to try and tackle my disordered eating. I hate my body and I think I look disgusting still, and I sincerely feel ashamed that Im not making any improvements on my mentality or this fucking disorder thats draining my wallet. 

The only other person who I told about my problems with bulimia was my mom, who in turn begged me to stop and called me selfish for wasting her money. I remember one day I came crying to her because I couldn't throw up the food i binged and that i would become fat, and she told me that she was going to kill herself if she kept seeing what I was doing, or that if she died it was because I caused so much stress onto her.

I want to stop with this cycle because it kills me. I just want to stop the b/p and return to be healtier like I was last week.

Hello, my name is Ethan and I am a trans man. I am here, today, asking for advice. Since I was about 11, I have been eating less and less over the years. (Age 11 also signifies the beginning of secondary school, a big change in situation for me) I started skipping meals, or challenging myself to see how long I could go without eating before I felt sick. I would put other people before myself, at school anyway, and skip breakfast and lunch, and eat maybe just pasta for dinner at home. Then, the summer would either make it worse by eating less, or make it “better” by eating more. Then, the cycle would continue again when school started. 

It’s been four years since then, and I’m only know realizing it isn’t normal to skip meals every day. However, this year marked the start of me counting calories, knowing exactly what I put into every meal, weighing everything I used in a meal, writing down how many calories I was eating, refusing to eat high calorie foods. 
This, coupled with the fact I had recently started wearing my fitbit watch again (which told me how many calories I was burning), made me feel worse and worse about eating. 

I set a limit for myself, at very low calories per day. This was at September, and since school shut down a couple weeks ago, the number has lowered to even lower. In addition, I started exercising a lot more than before. I wanted to lose weight, so what I was doing was healthy? It would’ve been I guess, had i actually ate something that day. 

Furthermore, ever since I was a child, I was obsessed with my weight. Now, I couldn’t really ever actually weigh myself, our scale for people broke back when I was five and we never bought a new one. But, I would stare at myself in the mirror and feel depressed as I looked at the fat around my stomach, and this got worse at puberty (coupled with gender dysphoria) as I gained even more weight. That ties in with the beginning of skipping meals at age 11 (puberty began at 10). 

And now, even though I’ve barely eaten anything and have grown at maximum about three inches since I was 11, I still have that weight, visibly. (Though, since August I had lost some weight) It made me feel bad, and I felt like shit whenever I ate in front of people. My s/o keeps trying to help me get over this, saying that he loves me for who I am, and how I look. But it’s just, difficult.

As of late, I’ve been trying to eat more. But I can’t, I struggle every time I try to eat more than one and a half meals a day, and then I barely eat the next day because I “don’t feel hungry”.

If I keep it lower, I give into some more food to satisfy my hunger. The people around me seem to have smaller appetites than me and are able to eat less, while still wanting less naturally. 
Although I tell my closest friends and boyfriend about my insecurities, I never let them know how mentally terrible and hard it is.

About a year ago I had shoulder surgery and during the recovery my daily mental health issues (depression and anxiety. In treatment but nothing super serious) began to increase for this and also because my dad was was going through significant health issues (happy news, he is now way better). Also, I’m typically a very active person but was holed up due to the surgery. 

I began eating less and less during this period. I attributed it due to the lack of calories I was burning and my body adjusting to a new routine. But I have been back to my normal routine for 3-4 months now, and I’m still eating very very little. There are times when I eat 3 full and healthy meals for 3 days straight, but more often, nI have 1 meal in 2 days. I’ve never vomited after eating, I’ve very rarely eaten until uncomfortably full (thanksgiving only), and I don’t want to lose weight-if I’m being honest I’d like to gain about some pounds. But I will often skip breakfast, struggle through a few bits at lunch and then eat a tiny dinner. This while working an active job that I am out and about for 8 hours a day.

The thing is that I want to eat and know I have to eat, but often, no matter how hungry I am or how good the food looks, it just makes me start to gag. And it’s a struggle to get through every bite, so I often just end up not eating. I even often feel lightheaded throughout the day, but just can’t force my body to eat. 

I guess my question is, does this sound like anything you guys have every heard of? I kind of just made this realization, I knew something weird was going on for a while but only recently truly came to terms with it. I tried googling but nothing really fit what I’m going through.

I have had a couple of individual meetings as well with the therapist and we have agreed to put me in another group in April. The question is whether to start me in the 5 days a week-group or just a different once a week group (yeah, that's quite a difference). The decision is going to be made by a nurse next Tuesday.

At first I really didn't want to be in the 5 days a week-group, but now I have completely switched. My fear now is that the nurse is not going to think I'm ill enough. I want to be completely honest with her but the thought of only having one appointment a week scares the crap out of me. Right now my entire life revolves around this disorder and I really can't take it any longer. I have had a couple of bad experiences with not being takes seriously by medical professionals, and the past couple of weeks I have actively gotten myself deeper into this disorder just to try to convice them that I need this help.

I feel really guilty about my behaviour, as if I could actually do it on my own but I just don't want to, and instead I'm taking the place of someone who would need it more. I don't know if I actually would make it with only once a week sessions, I haven't so far, but I keep feeling that if I just decided to get better, I would. At the same time, the thought of complete recovery doesn't even scare me because because it seems so unreasonable.

I don't even know what kind of response I wish for. I don't even know if what I wrote makes any sense. Just please, comment your thoughts.

46,EDPostRequests,1584439370,fk2pgu,"Hello. First time posting here, I am relatively uninformed with the correct way to speak about eating disorders so I apologize in advance for any mistakes I make.

 Recently (about a month ago) I began seeing a girl who has struggled with an eating disorder in the past. We haven't spoken about it at length, as I want to let her share things when she feels comfortable, but I know that her difficulties peaked more than six years ago and since then she has mostly recovered.

 She does not seem to have any trouble eating around me or others. I should also state that I really like this girl, and am thrilled to be spending time with her. The specific problem that I've run in to is that she generally won't take off her shirt during sex. I have stopped asking because I don't want her to feel pressured to do something she doesn't want, especially in an intimate setting, but I can't lie it is a little frustrating. Not only because the superficial part of me enjoys seeing her naked, but also because it feels like the clothing represents something of an emotional barrier between us.

 I don't want her to think I'm judging her, or that there's any chance I might find her unattractive if I look to close, or anything like that.
I guess really what I'm looking for is some context around what she may be thinking and whether or not I can help. Is this just a question of waiting and being supportive so that she can become more comfortable around me?

As a way to possibly keep improving the subreddit two surveys have been created. One survey to measure the current state of the subreddit. This allows you to give feedback on possible improvements and/or things that COULD / SHOULD change.

There's a difference between COULD / SHOULD. When you select stuff that SHOULD change you want it to be ASAP. Your reading experience would drastically improve.

If you select SHOULD then you'd like to see it but it won't affect your reading experience that much. 

#[Feedback survey](https://forms.gle/WSDw82NS9vvbFt2C7)

The other is a survey with the question if we should start a moderated, safe and secure Discord server for people to chat with.

For those unaware what Discord is, here is a summary from the internet:

Discord is a free voice, video and text chat app for teens and adults ages 13 and up. It was created to bring people together through a love of gaming. 

People can access Discord via their PC, browser, or mobile phone. Once there, they can join a chat they’ve been invited to or they can create private servers and invite their friends to play and discuss games by voice, text or video. They can also message each other individually or in group chats with up to ten other friends.


Discord is different than other social platforms like Twitter or Reddit, in that people come to Discord to build private, invite-only groups. All conversations are opt-in, so anyone not interested in chatting have a variety of tools at their disposal:


* Choose who can direct message you
* Choose who can add you as a friend
* Choose what servers you want to partake in
* Choose whether or not to block another person
* Choose whether or not to scan and delete direct messages with explicit content
* Choose who can join your server
* Choose security and verification levels on your server

The current thought of the Discord is explained in the survey however this is not the final idea. Before we'd make the Discord server live we'd look into making it as safe as possible.

The only way to make it safe for the majority of users is if YOU help suggest ways to keep/make it safe.

Because then at least it would mean I was trying, I was compensating for the binges. Plus if I’m going to have a fucked up relationship with food either way, I’d rather have the ED that keeps me skinny. I feel so, so ashamed that I binge. If I was anorexic it would be tragic- but my problem is just disgusting and pathetic. People can make all the anti-body-positivity comments they want, saying they’re concerned for you- but the truth is, no one really cares about the fat girl.!&lt;

#For those not willing to read the spoiler here is a short summary rewritten.


I've been doing some research about eating disorders and I think that I'm a part of the binge eating disorder group. I'm having trouble accepting this as I'd rather have an ED that didn't make me binge. If I could switch my binging behavior for something else, even though something else is also not OK, I would instantly.

I’m aware these thoughts are sick. I’m aware I’m not even really overweight, my BMI is like 21.5. It’s like there’s a completely rational voice in me, but if you peel off the top layer, the controls are completely under the control of this second voice who just wants to be pretty, so fucking badly.
Perhaps because I’m so aware of other people’s appearances, I assume the rest of the world is as shallow and mean as I am. I like beautiful things, and I don’t know how to stop that. I constantly have judgements towards other fat, ugly people, and then immediately after I’ll mentally slap my own wrist. But just because I catch myself doesn’t stop the fact that I assume that these other people are less successful than me, less socially adept, have less romantic options, and are less happy than me. Why do I assume they’re less happy than me when clearly I’m so incredibly unhappy with myself already?
The worst part of this is that even after writing this, which I’m trying to make as completely honest and genuine and cathartic as possible, tomorrow, nothing will change.

I won’t get skinny. I won’t get that much fatter at a rate any faster than I currently am. I won’t feel better about my body.

I won’t get help because I know that this change has to come from me. The dietitian didn’t work. I won’t make it to the gym. I won’t tell anyone else about this. Nothing will change, except I will have to keep living with these disgusting thoughts that literally consume every second that I’m awake. I don’t know where to go from here.

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for a year now, and with the new coronavirus going around I’d like to ask a question in relation to immune systems. I’m not too clued on this, and I like to be optimistic, however I’ve been freaking out about her lately due to the coronavirus and worrying about her catching it. 

If anyone wouldn’t mind, could someone shed some light on the effects of anorexia and immune systems? For some context my girlfriend developed her ED around a year and a half ago, however her parents realised quickly and put her into a recovery programme, so she’s been making progress and hasn’t relapsed since. 

So I guess I’m curious to know how worried I should be about this situation, like is it possible that her immune system isn’t too bad seeing as she’s been on a meal plan and hasn’t been drastically underweight since the beginning etc? Not sure if this means anything either, but she doesn’t necessarily get sick anymore, in terms of colds/flu etc. Anyway, I’m sorry if the wording was a little bit jumbled up, but I hope you understand! 

Aside from this, seeing as this is my first post in this sub, I would just like to say well done to everyone who chose to not let there ED define who they are.

52,EDPostRequests,1584217686,fioxrz,"I got really excited this morning to make nachos to eat as a meal for me and my partner. When I realized he wouldn't be able to share with me, I ended up feeling extremely depressed. I told him I was hungry and he told me to eat, and I immediately thought ""I should have eaten with my mom"" (I'm 19 in college and still live at home with my parents). 

I was in the hospital for severe stomach pain last month. They said my stomach was over-producing acid. My brother's girlfriend is a med tech and said that it could be because I haven't been eating enough. 

This situation today made me realize a lot. Like how the only meal I ate yesterday was the most I've eaten in probably over a month. I think it might be too late, but my inability to eat alone due to fear of losing control but also not being able to eat out because I don't want to be judged for eating by myself and the ways it's manifesting have made me realize that I'm relapsing (or quite possibly already have). 

He told me to eat. And because I'd be eating alone, I'm not going to. I don't know what to do.

I was basically told on the Friday before discharge that they thought I was ready and could graduate that Tuesday. I did not have a solid outpatient plan in terms of therapy, so that was not the best foresight on their part.

I have been bulimic for around one year now. Along with terrible body dysmorphic issues, i’ve become obsessed with exercise and planning meals. When I go slightly off the meal plan or end up bingeing, I absolutely hate myself and end up abusing laxatives and staying bedridden for the rest of the day out of guilt. I understand that this is incredibly unhealthy and since I live with my parents I asked them to help me find therapy. My mom said that for the insurance to cover it, I need to speak to the family doctor so I can be referred to a psychiatrist. My family doctor is a VERY close friend of our family and it would kill me to have to tell her my issues. I wouldn’t be able to look her in the face every day. How do I overcome this so I can get help?

Then I became a bit obsessed over how my body looked and the fact that I didn't fit into my skirt anymore and my jeans felt tighter around my waist didn't help at all,

58,EDPostRequests,1584050865,fhomqy,"I hope this is not triggering, I'm not used to eating disorders and it took me a while to find the courage to type this out.

To explain my situation a bit: Im 18, male and have always been a little underweight. Being skinny felt like the only thing that made me likeable.
I started to eat healthy and exercised a lot by the time I turned 16 because I wanted to lose weight and then gain muscle mass. I felt confident for the first time and was really productive and at a good place mentally back then. I stopped by the time I was underweight and had gained some muscle mass as well. I continued with eating healthy, exercised a lot and didn't gain the weight back. I know that people with disorders lose control but I still had control over it all so I didn't think it was a problem.
I am now 18 and have not been feeling comfortable in my body and I am struggling with school right now. I started to exercise again because I have gained in the wrong places and exercise has always helped me when my mental health was declining. I weighed myself today and I have lost a lot of weight even though I always eat a lot and I don't look any different than before. Nobody else has noticed so I guess I'm all good, as long as I don't look like I'm dying. I'm aware that there are a few red flags here but it sounds worse than it actually is as I'm not experiencing any health issues and am not addicted to weight loss. I know that it is a coping mechanism but I can go without losing and I can go back to eating normal if I need to.

Here's the issue tho: I have never learned how portion sizes work and I think that's why I have started to be conscious of what I eat in the first place. I never know how much food is appropriate and I always eat everything on my plate (I don't even know why) so I always fear that I'm overeating. Once my metabolism slows down when I'm older, I will gain if I still eat as much as I used to. So I tried to teach myself how much food is okay/normal to eat.
I know that you can learn about that stuff in recovery so I was wondering if you have any advice? I really don't want to gain but I think that if I continue to lose weight I will have to go to the hospital and I don't want them to think I have a disorder. Especially if they force me to eat. I also don't want them to make me heavier than I have ever been because even my normal weight has always been a little low.

I think this will fix itself once I learn how to eat properly. I don't trust my judgement on what is too much tbh. I don't want to measure (I used to count calories as good as I could without measuring, I counted my steps and monitored my weight as well) because that's disordered behaviour and I don't want to slip into anything. 
I'm generally really bad with estimating stuff, not just food but also spaces (?). There have been a few incidents in the past where I attempted to make my friends move in order to e.g. sit next to them on a bench and they always look at me weird and when I sit down I notice that they didn't have to move in the first place. It's been happening a lot lately and I think that one of my friends (we aren't close) is watching me even though you can't see my weight loss. I'm getting really self-concious if anybody watches me eat and I feel like I have to eat a lot in front of her so she stops monitoring me.

That's all I guess, thanks for reading. I mostly need advice on how to estimate how much food I need because that's probably the root of my problem. And I guess I kinda needed to vent. Idk, maybe I just want to hear that I shouldn't worry about my friend and everything.

When she was working, she would go to the gym every morning for around an hour/hour and a half. We would have dinner together every night as a family. 

Overall, her relationship with food was not presenting a problem, however it was still a very controlling and neurotic relationship. Now that she has retired, this relationship has been pushed to the extreme. She has completely cut out carbs, rarely eats dinner, and has told me multiple times that she eats far below a healthy number of calories

. She does 2 hours of cardio every day. She has always been a thin woman, but now it has gone too far. Her face is gaunt, her legs are all bones. She has issues with bone density as it is and has broken at least 2 bones in the last year. I am so worried about her. 

She has my dad, but he's pretty oblivious to most things and hasn't done anything to indicate that he recognizes this problem. I feel like a horrible daughter for not picking up on this sooner or realizing that this problem could escalate from what it used to be. 

I think she thinks in retirement now she has to stay fit and active (which is great!), because her parents and siblings have all kind of let themselves go as they've aged and she has said that she always wants to be able to be active and independent as she ages. But this is not the way to do it. She has little muscle mass to be able to do anything. I'm so worried about her. How do I even bring up this subject to her? 
She is a stubborn 56 year old woman who is very stuck in her ways. This situation is even more complicated by the fact that I have been very overweight my whole life and within the last year have worked on being healthier and have been able to lose a substantial amount of weight myself. I am sure that only exasperates this issue.

60,EDPostRequests,1584038957,fhlc6c,"I've been in recovery for 9 years and though I've been struggling with body image recently, I enjoy eating and I don't restrict or have any distorted thoughts around food. I noticed a couple weeks ago that per my fitness tracker, my heart rate was frequently elevated above 100 BPM (my resting heart rate is usually around 70-80), even when I was at rest. I checked this manually and confirmed each time that the reading was correct. I turned on an alert on my watch that goes off when my HR is over 100 for 10 minutes straight while resting, and both that and my HR data each day reflect these clustered incidents. I feel calm and rested so I'm usually taken aback when the alarm goes off.

The times this occurs are almost always before/during/after meals. It seems to start when I'm planning to eat (e.g. walking into the dining commons), continue as I eat, and go on for up to an hour after my meal. It also appears to happen whether I've waited til I'm ravenous or I eat when I just start feeling hungry. I do suspect it's underlying anxiety and its correlation with meal times is significant. I don't know if it's blood sugar-related, but it'd be odd that it continues consistently for so long and isn't affected by how long I've gone without eating.

I have no underlying medical conditions, and I'm perfectly healthy as of my January physical. I spent a few days de-stressing and cutting out anxiety triggers, but I'm still experiencing it around meals only, not even when I'm worked up/stressed/anxious about other things, so I don't think it's generalized anxiety, though I am diagnosed with GAD.

61,EDPostRequests,1584034771,fhk7en,"Hey all - I've been lurking this site for the past few years but never posted. Figured I'd spread some positivism today.

I'm a 37 female and I've been in recovery for over 13 years now. I started restricting when I was 12 years and didn't fully into a recovered state until I was 22/23 and decided to go back to college full-time. I will say I was very good at my eating disorder that I was inpatient 9 times in 7 different centers with a feeding tube twice. If I can get better - so can you.

Some things that helped me in recovery: 

1. Getting out of my old ED environment. This meant moving out of my mom's house into the dorms and making new friends.

2. Social Interaction - I could not do my behaviors if I was isolating. So I ate with friends and even just out in public as much as possible.

3. Having a goal outside of my ED. I went back to college so I had classes and projects to focus on rather than meals and numbers.

4. STAYING ON MY MEAL PLAN. I did this for the first few years. Whatever I had to do to get it in - I did it. It sucked. I did not like it for awhile then it was just normal and my anxiety became less and less. I can say my anxiety around food is zero now.

5. Giving myself GRACE. This does not go away over night. It will suck some days. Some days will feel like a gift. Your body will change but that is what it takes for your mind to change!

However, her grandmother recently passed away unexpectedly she was her biggest supporter throughout the whole process (I only met her when she was in remission) and now my gf tells me that her death is not only making everything harder in general but also making her remission harder.

 She says that she feels worse about her body now than ever and I just want to be there to love and support her but I’m not sure how to take the place of her grandmother as she knew everything about how to support people with EDs bc she went to classes on it and everything.

 I would just really appreciate it if people had any suggestions on things that worked for them or what they wish people had done/said to help them (I’ve asked her what I should do to support her and she said she doesn’t really know as she never really got support from anyone except her grandmother  (her parents don’t really as they always say stuff like “just eat” and I know it’s not as easy as that and that that’s hurtful to her recovery)). 

I know the basics of what to say and what not to say as I’m studying to be a clinical psychologist, but EDs are far from what my specialty is, but I’m not completely in the dark. Like I said before, all I want is to love and support her and help her feel good about herself again bc that’s what she deserves. I’m open to hearing any suggestions and if I think that it even has a slight chance of working for her, I’ll give it a shot.

64,EDPostRequests,1584021755,fhgsnm,"I first made this post in a relationship subreddit asking about my boyfriends unusual eating habits. I never recognised that he may have a disorder until someone commented that so I'm looking for other opinions. 

We have been together 5 months, he is 25. This has been going on the entire time.

My boyfriend is quite weird with food, I don't know what to make of it as I've never encountered something like this before.

He doesn't eat the majority of food, because they're ""unhealthy"", ""bad"" or would cause him to ""go back to his old ways"".

He is very slim and lean, he hates having body fat and a lot of his eating seems to be focused on making sure his bf % is as low as possible. However, he used to be overweight. I don't know how big he was as he has deleted all old pictures and doesn't like talking about it, but I know it made him very self conscious and he has said before that he was ""disgusting"". He gets weirdly annoyed and upset when anyone even mentions the fact that he used to be bigger. I don't think people treated him well when he was fat. 

I'll try my best to explain all his weird  routines but I will probably forget stuff. 

He is vegan and doesn't eat carbs, except on saturdays when he allows one small portion. He spends ages planning out his ""carb meal"" of the week. He weighs EVERYTHING and puts the calorie count in myfitnesspal. Obviously low carb vegan is super restrictive anyway, but he takes it even further to the point where the majority of his diet is just beans and vegetables.

Before every meal he drinks a cup of water and a cup of green tea. Before every evening meal he will also eat a bowl of plain boiled vegetables, usually broccoli or cabbage or something. I don't know why he does this, I asked him and he just said ""habit"" like okay... another thing he does is cuts everything into super tiny pieces and eats realllyyyyy slowly. In the last few days I realised he does this to suppress his appetite so he eats less. 

One time I cooked for us and he was okay with it until I showed him the box of the vegan meat we were using. It was very high in fat and he realised it had put him over his calorie allowance for the day and got really weird and upset about it, and talked about ""spiralling"". He exercised more and ate less the next day to make up for it.

We have only been out to eat together once. The only thing he could eat on the menu was a salad. He *picked out the breadcrumbs*. Like he sat there and picked out every tiny crumb before he ate a single bite. He's aware that his eating habits are weird because he said ""don't judge me"" before he did it...but I was just like ???. I'm not sure why he is so afraid of eating bread, even tiny amounts. It's like a phobia or something. 

He often says that he ""hates eating"" and wishes he didn't need to do it. I said something like ""maybe you need to eat some nicer food"" and he said something about how food is only fuel to him and eating nice food is self indulgent and unnecessary.

Is this concerning or is it normal for thin people that used to be bigger? 
He is very slim and has hardly any body fat. He has that ""paper thin skin"" look and you can see all his veins and muscles. He always has extremely cut abs. I don't think his bmi is underweight though, probably low end of healthy. He carefully tracks his body fat to make sure it is always under 8%, but he says that he is happier when it is around 5%. I think he looks a little bit gaunt and unwell sometimes, but I could be biased. He is clearly very fit as he is able to run long distances and works out every day.

I spoke to him once seriously about it, and he just said ""as long as I'm healthy, I should be able to eat what I want"" which I agree with, so I'm not really sure what I can say.

It just bothers me a bit. I wish he could be a bit more free with food and enjoy things without beating himself up about it. It's clear that eating causes him anxiety on some level, he admitted to that, but he said it's better that than be obese again.

Should I speak to him or is it none of my business? Is this an eating disorder?


Tldr; not sure if I should speak to my boyfriend about his eating habits. He doesn't allow himself to eat the vast majority of food and has weird rituals around eating. He used to be overweight and i think the anxiety is kind of focused on that. I'm concerned he may have am eating disorder.

So I have always been underweight because I have a fast metabolism and lose weight rather easily. I have kinda lost my appetite recently because of stress and because I'm not doing well mentally and have lost some weight due to that. Currently I am eating enough to not gain it back. I do not actively try to lose weight tho.
I am quite active and recently started eating cleaner again. I don't like a lot of foods, especially greasy stuff because my stomach hurts after I eat it. I do skip meals sometimes because of school but I am not even that underweight so I never thought it was a problem. I don't even weight myself and don't monitor my eating. I am always hungry but I think that is when I am bored or stressed so it's useless to eat then as my body doesn't need it but is just acting up.

I have been feeling dizzy lately, similar to when you smoke for the first time in weeks, but it usually passes after some time and I think it is anxiety or stress. I nearly passed out in the shower tho and my mum dragged me to the ER because of that. I also had stomach pains and couldn't stand up and my heart is all weird (that's probably all anxiety tho). 
Anyways, the doctor and nurse have been concerned because of my sh scars (my family doesn't know about that). They weighed me (my bmi is not that low) and took a look at my blood work and checked my organs and stuff. 
The doctor said I should come to her if I need to talk but I guess that's kinda standard for someone who cuts. She did give me resources for therapy and there was one about eating disorders. 
Does she think I have an eating disorder or is she just too careful? I am scared she might want to talk to my parents or that they talked to my mum while I was in another room.

80,EDPostRequests,1583515876,fegw0g,"So I’ve struggled on both ends of the spectrum with disordered eating. From age 11-19 I went through periods of restrictive eating, I was good for about 3 years, and then when I was 23 I started binging periodically, and am still trying to get a handle on that 3 years late. BUT I’m not a restrictive eater anymore.

My boyfriend started a fitness journey about a year ago, and has really started to see some muscle gains. Only now he’s obsessing over it. He flexes in the mirror constantly, and is always coming up to me and getting me to feel all his muscles. I know he is proud of himself, and it’s exciting to see positive changes in his body, but it makes a part of me feel lousy. I try to go to the gym, and he gets so excited and encouraging and proud when I go, but will kind of give me a disappointed shrug when I tell him that I didn’t go and tells me I need to push myself to go even when I don’t feel like it. I know he is just trying to motivate me, but it just sorta feels extreme and it feels like I have someone telling me I’m not good enough (when I know that’s not what his intention or thought process is... it’s my own issue).

He has become a slave to myfitnesspal and obsesses over his macros. The thing is, he doesn’t even truly know the benefits of each macronutrient. He has never done research, he just thinks protein = good, and carbs and fat = bad. Watching him read labels constantly is annoying, and makes me feel self conscious when I went to enjoy a treat that he has deemed as “bad”. I’ve tried explaining to him that there really aren’t good vs. bad foods, and that some treats are okay in moderation, yadda yadda, and he just brushes me off and says that that’s a good mindset for me, but it doesn’t work for him and that discipline has been important in his fitness journey, and that he’s never held himself accountable like this for so long.

Today really got to me though. Every Saturday his work orders those party pizzas. He hasn’t had any pizza for a month because he was doing “no dairy February”. I also tried to do it with him, but the restriction was really hard on me and always checking labels for dairy was too obsessive for me to feel okay about it. Today he asks if we were gonna be eating out tonight (it’s a friends birthday and we’re going to clubs), so I said probably because we’re going to be out partying and will probably get drunk food at 3am. He said he really wanted one little square of pizza (you know how party pizzas are just the little squares) but that he didn’t want to if we were going to be eating out later. These squares are SMALL and the caloric value isn’t high. I told him to just have one square as a treat and then eat the lunch he brought. He said “but if I have one square then I will relapse” ....

Relapse on what???

I don’t know if he just isn’t aware of what relapsing really means, or if he sees pizza as that bad that having one tiny square of it will set him back completely. I know that I’m a bit of a hypocrite because I’m still struggling with finding a healthy balance in my eating, but I worked SO hard to put the restrictive habits behind me, and specifically to accept that eating things like pizza once in a while isn’t bad for me (on the contrary I may have taken that a little too far lol but anywayyyy).

I told him how his comment made me feel (triggered), and he said that it was just a joke because he knows he can control himself, he just can’t decide whether he wants to control, or indulge.

To me, indulging does not mean one little square of pizza. So now I am just concerned that even though he brushed the relapse comment off as a “joke”... he still thinks that having one slice is indulging. This used to be his lunch every Saturday, and he would easily eat like 8 of these squares (which for reference = 3 regular slices of pizza).

My perception of food is still kind of skewed and sometimes I can’t tell what is truly okay or not. I’m being triggered by the way he is talking about this pizza, but I can’t tell if I’m the problem or if he might have a problem.

I have ARFID (a food avoidance disorder) that as plagued me since birth. It’s been a chronic thing for me.

I’ve attended eating therapy, been to doctors, etc, but nothing has done anything for me. Yes, I know I need to put effort in to, I’m just saying when I attended, it did not help.

Because of recent concerns, I was issued a heavy bloodwork test which checked almost every area.

As the results filter in, I see a huge problem.

I am vitamin and iron deficient (very expected) causing anemia and I am now taking supplements for that.

The biggest problem is that I am pre-diabetic at only 15 years old.

To solve this problem, most people just adjust their diet and use alternatives in recipes (a flour I can’t remember, fake sugar, etc.). However, with my ed, this is way harder. I have an over sensitive palate and can taste most changes in food and it’s very possible I will end up cutting anything that tastes different out of my already incredibly limited diet. You’re also supposed to stop consuming any sugar and cut back on almost all carbs. And, well, basically all of my diet is carbs with some added sugar.

√do you get ""mad"" when you eat a very bad meal? It happened to me and my bf to try a pizza place and it was horrible. I felt in a super bad mood after it, I didn't even want to finish it. I felt like ""such a waste of good food time I could have had instead of eating this crap"".

√sugar craving? I have never had a sweet tooth but Jesus lately I have been indulging in cooking more sweets for me and my bf ahaha associated with period it's the worst lol

√does an Ed recovery subbredit exists? I would love to join it 😻

90,EDPostRequests,1583394738,fdrzif,"A few years ago, I decided to lose some weight and started to track everything I ate, keeping below a strict (and not healthy) calorie limit. Then, I went the other extreme and ate so so much food in the evenings (after trying to restrict earlier in the day). I then went back to restricting, much more intensely with a much lower calorie limit. I also started to feel a lot worse about my body and would try to go a really long time without eating. I was just generally really miserable during this time period.

But I’m a lot better now. I fluctuate between being okay with eating (but just thinking a lot about it), and being pretty upset with myself if and while I eat certain foods. I guess I still try to subconsciously keep below a certain limit, but I try not to think too much about it.

So now I’m wondering, do I have an eating disorder right now? I know people can’t really diagnose me, and this probably isn’t even enough information, but I guess I just wanted some outside input. I recognize that eating disorders sometimes arise when you start to feel like you’re losing control over certain things in life, and this whole thing started when I came to college, and I kind of lost myself in my studies and felt that I didn’t have as great of a handle on things as I did in high school.

I’m considering talking to a therapist/psychiatrist, but I also think I’m just really overplaying this situation, especially since I’m in a much better mental state than I was in last year.

i was in a treatment centre for anorexia from the age of 12 to about 15. i convinced the treatment centre i was at i was better and didn't need any more therapy. i was 100% lying, but i hated the centre so much and i had panic attacks every time i had to go.

over the next couple years, i still struggled a lot with my body image but i became weight-restored. my family and friends all stopped worrying about me, i even went through a stint in grade 11 where i gained a lot of weight. i was horrified when i went to the doctor and saw the number and lost the weight through calorie counting and exercising a lot.

the thing is throughout this whole time, i still felt very similarly to how i felt when i was younger and struggling. in terms of body-image, guilt, restrictive patterns, etc.

i am now 20, and this past year was a tough one. i was eating in an extreme deficit, back on my ed twitter account, taking constant bodycheck photos, etc. i lost weight and the people in my life noticed. but i felt like a fraud, like even though i was doing restrictive behaviours i felt like my illness wasnt valid and i was just going through a phase or something.

i am trying to take care of myself now and not over-restrict to lose weight. but it's very hard for me to not slip into my old ways of restriction. 

i guess i am  confused about what recovery means. when you are fully and legitmately recovered, do you never get these feelings again? does my relapse mean that i was never recovered in the first place? i wish i could understand these feelings, i am so frustrated at hating my body and myself so much that this is how i treat myself.

like i was tube fed as a kid and i think this is where all my ED-related issues stemmed from because the people around me enjoy eating and I see it like a chore or something i have to force myself to do... and i feel alone? in this regard. i was tube fed as a young child and in and out of the hospital for years... i have a love/hate relationship with food and eating and the only thing i ""love"" is that i need it to survive. other days i get so excited over small things like cookies or milk and then like 20 minutes later i'm like ""forget it"" and won't even consider cookies or milk for another 8 hours. this turned into a rant i'm sorry.",EatingDisorders,Request: Seeking information about ARFID,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fcspwi/request_seeking_information_about_arfid/,1583253253.0,2020-03-03 04:34:13
100,EDPostRequests,1583231271,fcsnrw,"Hello,
I recently noticed my heart rate going as low as 51. Today it’s been between 55-60. I’m not an athlete by any means. I am young and do sport 2 a week at the most but make me run 800 meters and I’ll be dying in the floor. I am not even close underweight, I’m average. I do restrict my food intake for periods of time. The last few days have been me restricting. I haven’t lost any significant amount of weight at all. However I am wondering if you can still get heart damage/ dangerous heart rate if not at a low weight. Does not getting enough nutrients cause this? Or does this not have anything to do with my disordered eating.

I’m not expecting reliable medical advice nor using this instead of a doctor. I was just  wondering if anyone knew if you have to be underweight to get these effects.",EatingDisorders,Request: Low heart rate question - Post request,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fcsnrw/request_low_heart_rate_question_post_request/,1583252871.0,2020-03-03 04:27:51
101,EDPostRequests,1583112000,fc4897,"I'm a 15 year old female who has a lot of stress from excessive body checking, feeling fat, fear of feeling full, fear of high calorie foods, and obsessive calorie counting.  Last year I was forced by my parents to gain some weight, but since then I have lost it all again and have been having a hard time gaining it back.  I constantly feel like I'm not sick enough to have anorexia.  My BMI is healthy and I eat enough calories, but still my parents think I'm too light and I obsess over all of the fat and can't keep my mind off of calories.  Because my parents think I need to gain weight, I'm currently not allowed to excersize which has left me feeling endlessly guilty.  I guess my question is, can I even have an eating disorder if I'm a healthy weight and eat enough calories?

102,EDPostRequests,1583111990,fc486c,"Honestly, if it weren’t for the fact that I’m being tested for a bunch of physical illnesses, I probably would’ve relapsed by now. I’m struggling a LOT with my weight, especially given that I live with my parents and they aren’t exactly supportive. 

Right now, it seems like all of my ED thoughts are hyper-focused on the test results. If I’m getting an ECG or blood tests, I spend ages trying to eat “perfectly” so I get “perfect” results. I’ve also started to weight myself again because in my head, “If my weight changes too much, the test results will be thrown off”.

All of this has led me to being stuck in a weird semi-binge semi-compensate cycle. I’ll sometimes start bingeing, but then freak out, or the opposite, where I’ll restrict for a day, but then freak out. It’s like I can’t decide between relapsing and being “perfect” for the test results.

107,EDPostRequests,1583111877,fc47a9,"Hi firstly title says it all. In brief, I was hospitalised for anorexia a few years ago and after maybe 6-7 years would say I’m pretty much recovered mentally and physically - it has taken a lot of strong will and I’m proud of myself! 

I posted previously with a concern that my sister (very sporty, runner etc) was losing weight and I had noticed this and was concerned she may be developing some disordered eating habits. The responses were mainly saying that I was being hyper aware and overly obsessed with regards to eating habits (understandably) when in fact it could simply be a healthy weight loss. I accepted this may well be true and tried to ignore my concerns. 

Fast forward another few months and my sister admits to struggling with eating via text to myself(and asks for help from me!) and she is now clearly underweight and starting to look ill. I feel vindicated by this after previous responses but in all honesty, I wish I had been being a bit psycho (!) and hoped nothing was up- sadly this isn’t the case. 

I’m mainly looking for any advice on how to deal with this... my parents are trying to book a family holiday in a few months- I have just seen my sister and there is no way I can spend any length of time around her without feeling angry and hugely triggered by the whole situation. I don’t want to risk my own health when I am doing so well currently. I also don’t want to speak my mind to my sister too much as I know when I was ill, I loved people noticing I was underweight (barmy I know but that was how this mental illness manifested itself in me and I’m very wary of this. I don’t want to bring attention to her weight too much if I can help it). Secondly, any advice on how to tell my parents a holiday is off the cards without breaking my sisters confidentiality? I love her dearly and do not know how to act around her/towards her to stop this lasting 6 years like it did with me. I’m at a loss because I recognise there is nothing anyone could have said to prevent my decline all those years ago. I am unfortunately not going to see her until she is better and this may be many years and this saddens me...",EatingDisorders,"Request: Anorexia is ruining the relationship between me(26, F) and my sister(24, F)- any advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fc47a9/request_anorexia_is_ruining_the_relationship/,1583133477.0,2020-03-01 19:17:57
