Feel free to drop me a message if you need someone to vent to.) 

You’re not alone &lt;3 I’ve been going through a similar time right now, and it sucks because after trying so hard to recover for a good few months, it feels like the ED voice came back with a vengeance but my body’s just not doing what I want it to. Idk if that makes any sense. I know you said you want to push on, but if you have someone (family, s/o, therapist, friend) who knows about your ED, I strongly recommend talking to them. Even though you desperately want to hide it and crave the security of slipping back into old habits. Vocalizing your feelings and knowing that somebody will be looking out for you (and can even validate you in terms of helping you see how you really look) can be so powerful in giving you back some agency. 

That being said, I know that sometimes turning back towards recovery is hell. If you need someone to vent to (especially someone who can’t judge you personally or hold you accountable or whatever), please feel free to message me.

It's extra hard when it feels like the only reason I'm at a healthy weight is because of my eating disorder.*

Wow, I am right there with you. I've been hovering at a borderline healthy weight, and I feel like my disordered behaviors are the only reason I'm there. I definitely agree that it's hard, especially since a little voice is convincing you that you only look good because of the disorder, but that's not true (and I'm trying to remind myself of that). I also try to remember that my body *needs* food, and that any disordered thought is just that: disordered. Gaining weight doesn't equate to a bad body, either, even though it may feel like it! 

Like someone else said, I'd definitely recommend talking to a family member, friend, or calling a previous therapist. Just having someone know what you're dealing with can be so reassuring. I know you said you've only wanted avocado toast, but maybe try and find some other recipes that sound good - if it's avocado you're craving, find some others that use it as an ingredient! I've found that I'm a lot more willing to eat if I enjoy cooking the meal.

Anyway, it's good that you know these feelings will calm down in the future. Until then, I'm definitely supporting you and empathizing. ♥",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would encourage you to try and challenge those rules a little bit at a time - maybe take 2-3 bites of dessert or add a little bit more topping than is initially comfortable. How often are you chewing and spitting? You might check in with where that’s coming from - is it because you feel like you can’t eat a specific food? Are you still hungry but feel like you’ve eaten enough? You might experiment with what it’s like to swallow some of it and see how you feel &amp; if you are able to tolerate it. Recovery can be a long process. I’ve been recovering for 8ish years and in pretty solid recovery for about 6 and I’m still noticing places where I overcontrol my food - maybe not in a pathological way, but I want to experience as much food freedom as I can.

In truth, not a single person is the epitome of normal eating--everyone binges sometimes, eats too little sometimes, has unhealthy thoughts or assumptions about food sometimes. The major point is whether those behaviors cause you mental/emotional distress, or affect your health.

I have had an ED for many, many years now. Contrary to most people, I choose to consider myself as always having an ED--even when it is dormant--rather than flip-flopping between ""recovery"" and ""relapse"". This help me, personally, to moderate those in-between times when my thoughts or behaviors may not be 100% healthy, but are also not so distressing to me as to feel that I'm spiraling downward indefinitely.

Point being, it's all up to you--if you feel these thoughts are precursors to more unhealthy behaviors, or if they are upsetting you constantly, then it's worth confronting them and figuring out how to move forward. If you don't feel that your overall health is suffering, and if you feel generally ok with where you're at, then it's also ok to just shrug and let it be.

No one is perfect--in the same way that you can't sustain a life suffering from an ED, you also can't spend your life trying to attain a pristine level of ""normal"" that doesn't exist. Find YOUR normal.",AndyF1069,1531589910.0,2018-07-14 12:38:30,"I was never officially diagnosed either, although there's absolutely zero doubt that I definitely had a disorder. I've spent the last ten years telling people about how I ""used to have"" an eating disorder when talking about certain behavioural things I do. I can't cope without my behaviours as they help me feel safe. Things like dressing a certain way or positioning my body or objects close to me in a certain way. 

My mental health has plummeted over the past 18 months after a mix of multiple deaths, a case of homelessness and a couple of family tragedies not related to the deaths . When I got a place of my own, I registered with the local doctors and have been completely open with all of my anxieties and concerns. She believes I may still have an eating disorder and I've been referred to an eating disorder clinic, but I don't know how long that'll take. I had to consent to it, and it wasn't an instant yes for me. The idea of challenging my own behaviours is a scary one. The idea of not having my safety actions or being pushed into body acceptance is a scary thing, because my brain is conditioned to believe that those things are bad. And logically I can accept that I'll likely be better once these behaviours are challenged, but it's the fear leading up to it that sucks. 

I think most people will have some sort of concern at some point over food. Did I order too much fast food? Should I be having this second helping of cake? That's a lot of beer. And the reverse is true for people trying to be health conscious as far as restricting themselves. 

But I don't believe that people obsess the way that those us of us with poor mental health or conditions obsess, nor do I believe that it restricts their lifestyle or further deteriorates mental health. I spent all of June restricting what I ate. I'd try my damndest to stay under a certain amount of calories (with exceptions for being with friends or family). I wouldn't allow myself any snacks or my favourite comfort foods. I made sure to not buy them just to make sure that I wouldn't give in to temptation. To me, that's me being ""good"" as far as reaching my goals. People with similar concerns might think I did good too. But I think most people would be taken aback and feel it wasn't necessary to restrict so much. And on the flipside, in the past week I've had fast food three times (twice with friends), including last night. Last night was an intense desire with nothing to do with hunger. And I've spent all of today regretting it, and haven't eaten yet (it's 6.30pm) but I will cook myself a meal soon. 

Emotionally, I feel as if I'm trying to take control. Logically, I know that it's unhealthy to restrict and to obsess. That's why I consented to be referred to the eating disorder clinic. As much as I fear it, I would like to get better. It would be nice to leave the house in summer in just a shirt (I literally can't right now). 

You're not alone. I won't advise you on what action to take, that's for you to decide. But I relate to you. Good luck with your recovery and you can get in touch if you wish.
