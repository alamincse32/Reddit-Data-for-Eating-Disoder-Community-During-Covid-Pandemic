My mom has stage 4 breast cancer and has been getting really bad lately, I broke down sobbing today. My husband and I are moving overseas in a month and I am terrified that the next time I see her may be the last. I am sure I will be a mess on the plane.

I don’t have much experience with a dnr but my dad has had lots of breathing problems and had a big scare last May where his oxygen was at 75 when we took him to the er. It is okay to cry. She is your mom and I’m sure she is your rock and someone you turn to when you’re happy/excited/scared/sad.

4,82tgat,None,"I know I keep thinking “This shit isn’t hard. Cancer is hard. Everything else is easy now.”

Stress, and aging (and boy does cancer stress and age you) propel us to become *more of who we already are*.  If there was aggression in you before, it’s coming out more now. You recognize this, give yourself a bit of permission, and consciously work on making it better. We wanted a bit of compassion when we struggled, so we can give it too. 

I have a little internal dialog that I use when I feel critical. I stop and ask myself “Is this an opportunity to be compassionate instead?” It’s so ingrained now that it has pretty much become rote. I get a lot of discounts and favors, not that it’s my motivation, but I see the effect it has on other people. 

All that aside, today in a software demo I said “nobody cares” to a subcontractor who was jabbering on. I was surprised it worked without offense, but it did. I can be a sarcastic turd but there’s no malice behind it. 

Another trick I use when I’m frustrated with someone is to immediately invite them to lunch and get to know them as a person, not an obstacle. 

For better or worse, my kind approach leads me to turn a profit, sell more, and get my releases into production first.  My clients request my help on their biggest projects, and I simply don’t have turnover on my teams.

I hope things get better for you too!",1520480993,07-03-18 21:49,DarkAster321,"Haven't gone through chemo yet (that starts next month) but I did manage my own division. Speak softly and carry a big stick. If, after you've tried to explain/correct the situation that these people just don't get it or don't care enough to get it, replace them. There are loads of people that will be happy to do the job if the ones that are there have gotten complacent or are incompetent. Obviously, no one wants to fire somebody, but, as you and everyone else on this sub knows, you have to cut out the cancer before it spreads. So, if you've got one particular pain in the ass, make an example of him/her. No screaming or yelling or threats, just a termination. The others will either realize how good they have it and work with a renewed sense of purpose, or they'll react negatively and then you'll know who else needs to go. The trick is doing it in a way that doesn't kill morale. I can't tell you how to do that as I don't know what kind of environment you're working in now nor do I know the personalities of those you manage. But in my experience, if you as a manager know who's a cancer, then the employees who really enjoy the work and want to be there know who's a cancer, too. As for your aggressiveness, I don't know...get a punching bag that you can unload on after work?",1520472172,07-03-18 19:22,Odin_Exodus,"Thanks for the great insight. You’re right in that perhaps I was assertive before but now I don’t have barriers or reason to withhold how I truly feel about something. I’m very passionate about my work and my career was budding before cancer struck. I was on the fast track to executive level responsibility and it’s definitely set me back. I’m doing my best to propel further ahead at Mach speed to try and catch up. Perhaps I need to take a step back, be humbled by the experience, and let my motivation and determination manifest itself in a more proactive way. ",1520486349,07-03-18 23:19,Odin_Exodus,"Thank you for the feedback. I've had a lot of time to reflect on this issue and I think much of it stems from the company structure, etc. When I took leave for treatment, I left my division on a silver platter with a bow - there's no way they could have screwed it up. Yet here I am constantly finding new issues varying from simple to fix to royally screwed.


I'll try and be more positive and project that to everyone I interact with. It would definitely help to have an outlet to work out my frustration. A punching bag actually sounds like a good idea.",1520476986,07-03-18 20:43,None,"I’ve had the experience of being young, and being middle-aged. It’s painfully obvious to teams who cares about their success, and who is relentlessly ambitious. Executive at 30 is pretty aggressive. Get a few grey hairs first, my friend. Personally, I don’t want the travel of an exec, and I love being on the ground, much like the cop who refuses the promotion on TV! I sincerely do not want to spend the years left chasing some teenaged dream of heaven. 

The ultimate compliment for a leader is “I would leave my current job in a minute to work for her again.”  Don’t let yourself become the man whose name people cringe to hear. Don’t just Manage up. Manage down. Learn every single name. If you don’t know the janitor’s name, you are not a true leader. 

My two cents. ",1520563209,08-03-18 20:40,DarkAster321,"Oh that'll do it. You work hard for something only for someone else to screw it up. Yeah, go punch something (not someone).",1520480140,07-03-18 21:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As far as your question, I really think you need to talk in person with some professionals.  This would mean either individual counseling, maybe family counseling, or attending family / grief support groups.

His passing is still so recent it's hard to say what is ""normal"".  Could some more time be needed before counseling?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  I think that's something you'll just need to figure out based on continuing symptoms.
