7,ples_help_me,1531462099,8yhigx,"My girlfriend has Anorexia Nervosa. It has been really difficult because her family does not seem to understand that what she is dealing with is actually dangerous. They chalk it up to just her being moody. So I am the only one who stays on top of her making sure she eats. But lately it has gotten worse. She used to love to cook, and eat, and she loves food. She has always been small, and relatively skinny, I dont think she has ever been over 110 lbs. Yet she sees herself as too fat now, and hates her body. She has severe anxiety and sometimes believes that I dont love her because she thinks there is no possible way for me to actually love her since she is so ugly in her own mind. It used to be that she would try to just eat really healthy and constantly excercise. She used to have some days where she wasn't as bad, or not bad at all, and could actually eat well. She doesn't have good days anymore. She fluctuates between being completely exhausted and depressed because of malnutrition and anxiety, and being angry at me for trying to get her to eat, to sobbing because she doesn't want to die and she feels like there is some part of her that is trying to kill her. She didn't want to drink water today because she was afraid it would make her bloated. It is almost impossible for me to get her to eat more than 1000 calories per day. It is a daily struggle and I don't see this getting easier soon. I am worried because I leave for school in a month and a half, but I am not sure that in that time her condition could improve to the point where I would feel comfortable not being around her.

I am a student at Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia. I’m currently undertaking a research project as part of a Bachelor of Psychological Science (Honours). I am investigating the factors involved in the development and maintenance of orthorexic and disordered eating behaviours (restrictive/binging/purging). The factors to be explored centre around issues of control (e.g. how comfortable or uncomfortable are you with feeling uncertain about life?). The significance of these factors in relation to each individual eating behaviour will be explored.

The study involves an online survey (average completion time is approximately just 15 mins) and everyone over the age of 18 (world wide) is welcome to participate!

All responses are completely anonymous and approval for this research has been granted by the Swinburne Human Research Ethics Committee (SUHREC) in line with the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines.

If you would like to help contribute to the research please follow the link:

Cheers!

(Please note: We are looking for participants across a range of eating behaviours. This includes orthorexic behaviour as well as other disordered eating behaviours (e.g. restrictive, binging/purging). So participants who engage in one of these behaviours or a combination of any of these behaviours are welcome. Additionally, those who don't display any of these such behaviours at all are also welcome to participate.)",Eating Behaviour Research Survey,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/94rde2/eating_behaviour_research_survey/,1533491988.0,2018-08-05 06:59:48

I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I wanted to know if her behaviour is actually related to an eating disorder or if she's faking it.

I'll try to keep it short, but basically she does things like saying ""I don't wanna have lunch today, I feel fat"". She spends HOURS tormenting people with that and when lunch time arrives, she eats as much as any other person, and brags about how healthy her food is compared to others and how our food is bs because ""that has meat and meat has a lot of calories, you know?"" and that sort of things. All she expects is for others to tell her she is not fat and praise her ""super healthy diet"". 
Speaking of which, her diet is not as healthy as she pretends it to be. Like, she will order a salad in a restaurant because ""everything else has cheese or meat. Ew, calories. How can you guys put all that fat in your body?"" and then have a cola for a drink instead of, I don't know, water. Seems contradictory to me, idk. (She DOES eat meat regularly, btw. She just enjoys shaming others for eating it).
Or buy a big popcorn box when at the cinema instead of having normal dinner, because apparently overly salty popcorn are healthier than a restaurant meal.
Also, this is, in my opinion, just very cruel from her part, but she has gone as far as to say (in front of her!!) that her eating issues are worse than those of a friend of ours who has been diagnosed with celiac disease, lactose intolerance and an unknown bowel disease (""because you know that you CAN'T eat [this food]. I can, but then I'll feel bad, so you have it easier"").

I've known her for 5 years now, and I have spent up to 12h a day with her during months (we were classmates at uni, and now coworkers) and I've never seen her skip any meal or go to the bathroom to puke. She also hasn't experienced any noticeable weight gain or loss in these 5 years I've known her. Btw, she has an average weight. 

I wanted to know the opinion of people who have experienced ED (or have any experience with people with EDs) to be more sure about whether she might really have eating issues (which she deals with by shaming others) or if she's just a b**** faking it for attention and using it as an excuse to shame others.

Before that my body was ""perfect"" and I actually did like it, I was fairly thin with big boobs but all the sudden nothing fit. All the taunts from my sisters over the years of SOMEDAY YOURE GONNA BE FAT came back to haunt me in a big way. I became terrified of eating, I couldt even trust my own body to tell me when I was hungry. Food became the enemy. I started a serious diet and ate the base minimum calories to exist. I cried all the time thinking I was never going to eat anything I liked again. I started working out religiously, I poured over details of online weight loss tips. I dedicated myself to it one hundred percent - then I found out that my problems were being caused by said ulcer. I started taking meds and continued my psychotic workout regiment. After only a few shorts months, the ulcer went away and my normal digestion returned with a vengeance soon after. I dropped weight rapidly and all the sudden I was nearing 100lbs. My ribs jutted out. I lost two cup sizes practically overnight and when my bras stopped fitting - I realized I needed to stop.

Now, three years later, I still have not been able to gain back the weight. I continue to have a messed up relationship with food and my anxiety and self loathing doesn't help at all.

63,emmaememma,1536688628,9eztob,"Why don’t you just eat?
I am sure this question has crossed everyone who has ever encountered someone with anorexia’s mind. Such a simple question and although I can attempt to try and answer this for you in a way you will understand I am probably still not going to be able to. Ultimately those with anorexia have brains which are working a bit differently than those who don’t and despite some similarities we are all individuals as well so every single person’s experience is going to be a bit different. It is so impossible to explain something to someone else who has not encountered it first hand. Even if you try and describe it with things they might have experienced then that is still going to be clouded by the fact that everyone’s experience of the same thing is different. Anyway I think one of the main reasons is fear. Now I am not talking about the kind of fear you feel when you are about to give a public speech or ride a roller coaster but I am guess I am basically asking you ‘why don’t you go jump off that 200m cliff into shark infested waters?’ To be honest though there have been many times where that would have been a less frightening option that putting extra food in my mouth. Also the cliff just requires one act of bravery and in this case is probably going to result in death so still a better option than eating as this is not a one off. Eating has to be done continuously and there is no escape at the end. You don’t get to die but instead the fear is even more amplified as the actual act of eating was only the first part. The sharks are now chewing away at all of your limbs and there is no pain relief. There is no one there to hold your hand either. You can literally feel the fat being deposited on every part of your body and to most people you are probably thinking ‘ so what ?!’  but to someone with anorexia this is a lot more frightening than death. This is why anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. It is not just death by starvation but suicide is a big contributor to this statistic. I have no words to describe the never ending torment someone with an eating disorder endures. It is real and it is absolute torture. 
Another point I need to bring up in answer to this question is that we do actually eat. Some of us may even eat just as much as you. The anxiety of eating can result in us ridding of the calories we have ingested in any way we can. Whether it is excessive exercise or making yourself sick. Neither of which are actually very effective either to be honest adding to further anxiety when we eat. We all know how much exercise one has to do to burn off anything really and there is only so many hours in a day. 
And the most important answer to this question is that eating does not actually solve the problem anyway. Even if our weight is restored does this mean we are cured? Absolutely not. In fact we are probably going to be worse mentally as anorexia is often a coping mechanism for other issues and illnesses. The support required to help someone who has gained weight is so intensive and inadequate the whole weight gain thing can end up just being a vicious cycle. One gets help to gain weight and then as soon as this happens is left in an incredibly vulnerable state with minimal support. Eating does not solve the intense disgust and worthlessness we feel in ourselves. You feel helpless, alone, inadequate and unloved. Ironically anorexia offers either a chance to be accepted or a way to fade away.

I was by no means large, but all my fat seems to go to my belly. I can't help but notice it, and every time I see it I want to slim down, but it never seems to work. No matter what I do my belly fat just doesn't go away even my weight is much lower than it used to be. I don't understand how it's happening because I have the same bmi as other girls, but they seem way skinnier than I do. 

I've been in therapy for a awhile, but my counselors never seem to worry about my weight. I don't if I'm anorexic, but my friends have been worrying about me. I don't exercise at all, but I read about anorexia and it said that anorexic people excessively exercise. Does anorexia need a professional diagnosis, or can it be self diagnosed? 

I'm I just overreacting? The last meal I had was about four or five days ago. Each day since I've had very small snacks once or twice a day. I don't have any appetite, in fact the idea of eating makes me feel sick. I just eat because I live with my friend and he often makes me eat, even just a little.

She says 94 lbs for her age is not unhealthy but what’s she’s been doing to be that weight is not healthy. This is not my story, it’s hers. I’m only sharing it because I’m worried about her health. 

Last year, her &amp; her older sister (I will call her A &amp; her older sister C) were getting weighed at the doctors office. Their doctor said that A was 100 lbs &amp; C (who is 16 years old) was 97 lbs. A told me that she started skipping breakfast, which I thought was okay. Now, she can’t even eat breakfast without feeling nauseous &amp; she starves herself 24/7. At school, she never gets up for lunch... she won’t even drink anything. She always says it’s because she doesn’t drink milk or she’s tired. A’s always been naturally thin but I can tell she’s getting thinner &amp; thinner...

I keep telling her to talk to her dad about it, but she’s scared of what he’ll say. Her family (dad, older sister, &amp; her) aren’t the type of family to talk about mental, physical, or emotional health. A few weeks ago, she told her dad about how breakfast makes her nauseous &amp; he told her to fix it because he’s “not a white parent”. Btw, A is biracial...that doesn’t really mean anything though. I’m not sure if her dad thinks black people can’t have eating disorders but he’s wrong. A mainly tries to avoid talking to him about it because she’s scared of his response &amp; because he works so much. She’s always talking about how she doesn’t want to be a burden to him...

Can someone please tell me if she’s at an healthy weight &amp; if this could be anorexia. I really just want my friend to be healthy.

72,galaxygal4790,1538222388,9jw1hi,"So first things first, I have extreme self image issues. I used to be fat as a kid (like really fat not just chubby) and I ended up losing all that weight in 6th grade. And I started getting taller so I really skimmed down. Well In middle school, I thought I was happy because I’m now skinny. Thinking back on it, I had an extreme mental issue here. I remember weighing myself every day multiple times and writing down my weight. It’s like if I would gain 1 lb I would instantly set myself out to go exercise. And my meals would go soemthing like this: 
Morning: water- maybe an egg and a fruit. 
Afternoon: a half sandwich with NO mayo + 3-4 crackers 
Dinner: whatever my mom made but just cut my portion down to half a plate. 

And as time went by it would be like only crackers and cheese or I would just restrict myself so much. And then it got to the point where i would eat a full meal and then find a time to throw it up and then go excicise to go get “rid” of whatever wasn’t able to come up. I have pictures of myself in middle school and I’m horrified. 

In highschool, I wouldn’t limit myself as much. I actually improved significantly. I only cut some sweets and fast food from my diet. That was about it. But I exercised a lot. And I would sometimes throw up whenever I felt that I ate too much. (Once a week or so) and stopped throwing up my senior year but I still had self image issues and feel like I’m just fat when I eat too much. It’s a feeling I get.  
But I know I’m not, just feels like it. 

I’m in college now and everytime I look myself in the mirror I see someone who needs to freakin eat! But then when it comes to eating, I don’t have an appetite. I just don’t. And when I do eat, I can’t eat that much cause I get bloated so fast and I start to get that fat feeling again. And my eating habits are so bad cause there’s times when I’ll eat once a day and other times where I’ll eat all day long. 

I want to gain weight. I want to look more “full”. I don’t like my collarbones popping out. I don’t like my skinny legs. My stomach... it’s a bit pouchy but idc I just want to gain some weight. I want muscle. But that requires me to eat a lot. And I’m afraid to eat a lot. Where should I start? What should I eat?

She was rather messy and immature. Her room was messy, her car was messy, she wasnt ever good with money and spent it on unnecessary things. I was always the good child, never got caught, never got in trouble, kept my room tidy, never spent loads of money. It got to a point where my parents would rely on me. If my room was ever messy or I slipped up once, theyd always say ""you're starting to look like C"". I never thought much of it but it started really bugging me. C always yelled at my parents and cried and picked fights with them. I always tried staying quiet and never getting into them. Whenever I would get upset they wouldnt let me. They wouldnt have it. Id always keep everything bottled up because I knew there wasnt any use trying. ""youre starting to sound like C, you're rooms looking like C's"" those words just repeated in my head and I always thought it was so horrible to be C. C was also a little overweight. I started to believe that I needed to be the complete opposite of C. So I started dieting. After dieting nothing realy was working so I started excersising and calorie counting and really seeing results. Everytime I felt unmotivated I told myself dont be like C.

The meds they’ve had me on to get it under control have really messed up my guts. I haven’t had a solid bowel movement in over a month and my appetite is still here but I’m also very fatigued. So it’s like I don’t have the effort to prepare a real meal. 

I’ve been drinking horchata for breakfast to get some decent carbs and get my energy up and they trying to eat a regular meal around mid day. Mid day meal is usually something like fried rice with meat and eggs in it or a tuna salad toasted sandwich. I try to stick to foods that aren’t going to come right back out of me within the hour. Some time later in the afternoon I drink about half a carton of chicken bone broth for the protein. I’ve also been drinking regular cokes and orange juice throughout the day to keep my blood sugar up. At night I may or may not eat again. Depends on how tired I am if I have the effort to get a bowl of cereal, some toast, waffles or maybe some ramen noodles. 

When I started the medications I was 127lbs.
As of yesterday I’m 114lbs.

95,astropop312,1539153611,9mx3ov,"My friend's been in a long relationship for several years with someone who has intimacy issues. Her SO claimed it was because it was difficult for him to respond to sexual advances, so their sexual relationship only flourished when he made the first move. She was patient with him but eventually felt like things were only on his terms and she wanted to be more active. When she asked about suggestions for how they could do that without making him uncomfortable, he admitted it was because he was ashamed his body was responding differently to her because she gained weight. She's about fifteen or twenty pounds heavier but still looks great, but now she's really suffering and is self concious about her body and her sex life. I'm worried she's going to consider anorexia or bulimia because she's joked about how easy it would be to drop the weight that way so that she doesn't feel so depressed about her body. 


What do I do to help? Should I offer to work out and diet with her or would that be rude? Should I tell him that she's really affected by this and he should reassure her? I don't know him very well but I can tell he's really ashamed and doesn't personally feel affected by her weight... his body is, and that upsets him too, especially with his trauma.

108,Kaylo-Ren,1540393176,9r0fjy,"I’ve been struggling with ED since middle school. ( I am 25 now) it seemed a lot easier back then... kids would tease me and I’d just go days without eating and hide my body underneath baggy clothes/sweatshirts. Once I got into high school I was eating again, I felt good about myself and confident - I gained weight but not much and was still comfortable being that size. 


College I ended up gaining A LOT more than the typical freshman fifteen (if you know what I’m talking about.) I was dating this guy and we ended up partying every night of the week which added up the calories from all the alcohol and late night munchies. Once I came back home I was at my highest weight ever - I felt so trapped in my body. 

I’ve always been very skinny and I felt like a completely different person like I was in a fat suit. I went back and forth between Anorexia and Bulimia for a few months and dropped a significant amount of weight. 

Trigger: for those who are curious I lost around 40 lbs. 
I felt good though, i was getting attention from guys again - people were talking to me because they thought I was pretty and thin. I felt like I had complete control - though I really didn’t.


Fast forward to now - I am currently in a new relationship with a guy and I have regained a lot of the weight I had lost. I feel utterly and completely disgusting with myself. I don’t like looking at my body in the mirror let alone feel uncomfortable getting sexual with my boyfriend because I don’t like the way my body looks. 

I’m currently fasting right now until I lose a significant amount of weight. I’ve been tracking everything I put into my body. ( which Is mostly just coffee, diet soda and water) I feel more determined this time around to do this and I guess maybe that scares me even more. I just want to feel like the person I was before... I feel disgusting and not myself because I am constantly stuck inside this fat body.

110,phoenix25,1540227508,9qfp9j,"I have a close friend who I think has developed anorexia due to stress. She has always battled anxiety/depression, but this year has been especially hard on her.

What started as losing weight to improve her morale post breakup has spiralled into her losing 60lbs in about 8 months. She looks very frail, worn, with her ribs showing clearly. All her muscle in her chest is wasted away. She looks very unwell.

While she’s never used the word “anorexia”, she’s commented multiple times about her severe body dysmorphia.

She’s very defensive, the few times I’ve commented on her weight loss (after she brought it up to me first) I’ve been met with her shutting the conversation down by saying she’s tired of hearing criticism about it. I think her mother is on her case a lot about it. Even last night she texted me saying she lost another 3 pounds. I knew that if I commented on it, it would result in her not talking to me for a couple weeks.

She’s not the attention seeking type, (“oh I’m so ugly and fat...” in an attempt to have you butter her up). She keeps mentioning the weight loss to me, and it feels like she’s asking for help. 

But I don’t know what kind of help she’s looking for. I’m not allowed to talk about it, I’ve offered to pay for psychological help, I’ve done everything I can. It’s like she pushes me into a minefield where one wrong step results in her being angry and me wondering if I just pushed her into being suicidal.

I also live about an hour away from her due to work, which complicates things.

When I do force myself to eat, it’s extremely tedious, I literally have to force myself to chew and swallow. I can taste food, but nothing ever “tastes good.” I just taste it, but there’s no pleasure connected to the taste, no matter what food it is.

I know this isn’t normal, and doctors don’t think this is a real issue since I am a 5’7 male at 145 pounds. 

I exercise regularly, but recently stopped because I don’t want to lose any more weight. I’ve tried smoking weed and it didn’t help one single bit.

Please don’t suggest just “eating more” or eating caloric dense foods. The issue is that I don’t have hunger signals and food tastes like something foreign like a piece of wood or rubber might. I’ve posted so much about this online and searched on google and then answer is just “eat more caloric dense foods.” Well that would be easy, but I doubt these people have tried to eat when they have no appetite and aren’t hungry. It goes against instinct.


I’m considering taking steroids or doing some other drug because I’m getting desperate and no one seems to care since I’m a healthy weight.

I really don't know where else to turn, except maybe my dr but I am just not ready for that yet.

Ive always struggled with my weight. Being on the chubby side a bit. My mom would make fun and call me out for it, despite not being the same way herself. 

When I was 16 I was raped by my older abusive boyfriend. My mom refused to help me and I never went to the police. I began to self harm to punish myself.

In my 20's I began counting calories and keeping a food diary, giving myself only 1000 calories a day allowance. I lost weight. Mostly everyone gave me positive feedback. And this just fuelled me, to hear things like ""you're so tiny"" and ""so skinny"" felt rewarding. 

Then I got married and had two babies. My weight shot up. Three years ago I almost bled to death from a peptic ulcer on my bathroom floor, while my husband and kids were out. If they hadn't come home when they did, I was told I would not have made it. This began a battle with anemia and low iron. I had monthly blood transfusions and iron infusions. I lost a massive amount of weight. 

Partially because I was sick, and didn't want to eat because it hurt my stomach so much. But it turned into me wanting to remain thin and underweight, at any cost. I calorie counted and exercised too much. 

I finally got to a point where my health improved but my eating barely did. I remained thin but not underweight per say.  

Then in Jan of this year, I was raped again. I have been harassed and stalked by the man who did it since. I went to the police the very night that it happened. I reported the physical abuse and the sexual. Due to me living in a different country, and not having the funds to return. The case was not called to court, but that's another long story.

Since then I have had social anxiety, to the point I sometimes don't want to leave my house. It feels like due the fact unless I go back to the country my attacker lives in, I have zero control over anything. My body. My life.

Thus began what I wonder isn't an eating disorder...my ""symptoms"" are as follows...(yes I know that only a professional can diagnose me, I am just looking for answers before I go that route, if I go that route). Symptoms:

1. Eating less than 500 calories a day, on purpose. Sometimes I eat more when others express concern but not often, I blame my lack of eating due to the fact my health is heading south again, because of new ulcers.

2. I have a lot of inner dread that when I do eat, I will gain weight from even one meal or snack. 

3. I hate eating in front of people, I feel like they are judging me. I'm not exactly why I feel like that. But when I do eat, I almost always wait till I am alone to do so. 

4. I'm 5'9, 105lbs with a 24 inch waist. Every bone that can stick out does. My collarbones, shoulders, my spine (even when not bending forward, my ribs are visible from front to back, my hip bones, the bones in my arms, my pubic bone, the bones in my butt lol and my tailbone. You can see my veins and tendons in my arms. 

5. When I look in the mirror, I can see that I am too thin. But yet my head is constantly telling me that I am fat. That I still have like 20lbs to lose. 

6. I am constantly tired, weak, dizzy and easily out of breath. When I stand up from sitting or standing, heck even kneeling..I am so dizzy I have to brace myself for fear of fainting and inability to move. My entire body shakes, and everything spins. 

I'm cold all the time, even when others are complaining it's too warm. 

My cognitive function is slightly impaired. I forget things so easily. I struggle to recall words at times when I am talking. 

7. I think about my weight and food constantly. It is taking over my life. I can barely take care of my kids, because I lack the energy to do so.

8. My emotions are a mess. I am typically a happy person, who is hard to anger. But lately it's not like that. I'm snappy and short in patience. 

9. I mostly try to hide my weight loss, with baggy tops and layers.

Sorry this was so long. Thank you for reading. Any opinions, good or bad are welcome.

When I was 19 I had my son and my body image since then has been a constant nagging pain for me after becoming overweight. This year has been one hell of a ride for me with anxiety and whatnot too. 
Since May I have lost close to 55 lbs. I haven’t changed my lifestyle or anything though and didn’t intentionally diet or workout to loose the weight. I didn’t even think about how I lost the weight I was just too happy about losing those numbers on the scale. 
Yesterday was my sons 2nd birthday and I made a ton of food for the party. After the party was over, people started complimenting me on how good the food was and that’s when I realized I didn’t even know what it tasted like since I didn’t eat anything and then I started thinking when was the last time I did eat and realized it was going on 4 days ago. 
The thing I’m confused about is when I was diagnosed with an eating disorder I was obsessing about food and counting calories non stop. I haven’t done any of those. I just don’t eat, it’s like I tell myself I’m not hungry and my body just agrees and goes with it. I don’t experience hunger pains that should remind me to eat, it’s like I have lost intuitive eating. Now I’m thinking about it though and I do recognize that it’s like I naturally reward myself when I don’t eat, like oh cool I look extra thin today so now I can wear that cute crop top and go drink a couple beers with some friends and somehow I naturally have an excuse to not eat when I go visit family or friends even though I hadn’t eaten prior to the visit. 
I’m sorry this post is confusing even for me but I just don’t know if this is a relapse because it’s not me obsessing about food. It’s just me telling myself I don’t need to eat and it just works.

159,CrispyFriedCommunist,1544120332,a3qldp,"Hello all, I realize nobody will really read this, but I just want to share my story. 

I think I've been anorexic since I was able to distinguish a fat girl from a skinny girl--basically, since I was 10 years old I had been trying to fast for hours, eat only vegetables *minimally* in a day, and made the mirror my enemy. 

I always saw myself like this: if I am not pretty in the face, or in the personality-- I can at least have a pretty body right?

So all my life since I was 10 I had been roughly underweight until I got to high school-- I was 14 when I started to gain a lot of weight. I went from around 100 lbs and an underweight BMI to 115 lbs and a normal weight BMI when I reached the end of my Freshman year. For a while, I embraced the thickness I had. I was roughly 5'2 at this point, and things seemed fine until the end of my Junior year when I had grown an ince (5'3) and had gained a lot more weight-- I was roughly 120 lbs by the end of Junior year. I had migraines all the time, I got sick very often, I would eat like a pig as soon as I got home and begged any one and everyone to eat out at some greasy restaurant. At this time I could barely squeeze into a size 7 and was on track to become a size 9. 

Then one day it, I remember sitting in my dark room--the sun nonexistent. I looked down at my stomach and all I saw was a disgusting flab of fat, sitting an another flab of fat. I literally told myself that day 'When I go back to school, everyone is going to see how skinny I got.' That summer is when things started getting really thin. 

I decided to try intermittent fasting and ate only *one* thing a day. Not one *meal,* but *one edible item a day.* It was very hard at first, but I managed to distract myself with school work. By the time school started, I weighed roughly 108 lbs and only went down from there with more distractions. By the middle of Senior year I weighed between 92-94 lbs. This is when people began to worry. My mom made me feel so terrible, saying I was only bones, what had happened to me--etc, etc. 

Well what had happened was I would try to starve myself so much so to the point where I could feel that hunger hit me, and to the point where I could virtually feel the fat gurgling itself away--  I never saw any results at first until I stepped on the scale and saw what I had done. 92 lbs from 119 lbs, 5'3 inches tall. It became an addiction, it's really made me happy to see I had lost all that weight. 

Then I graduated--by that time I was steadily packing the pounds back. Some things had happened in my life that made me go to food for comfort. Slowly I began to eat normally, first having a meal every day--then I started working and college began and I've hit my highest weight in months. I'm now roughly 107.5 lbs on a good day, and 110 lbs on a very bad one. I don't know how it got to this point again. I can't even breath in my size 3 jeans-- I can't wear anything without feeling disgustingly fat and I am trying to get back to 95 lbs at the very least. 

Today I drank coffee with 2 tbsp of Polyethylene Glycol, a laxative and pretended to eat my breakfast. Now I've been sipping more of the laxative with water and just need to keep on going today. I don't feel hungry like how I usually do around this time, but when I do I think I'm going to down apple cider vinegar (2 tbspns) whole and hope that works to curb any hunger-- at most I'll just eat a donut today and that's it.

I feel so great while I’m doing and I’ve become addicted to it. I don’t have any cravings and I honestly just don’t feel hungry. When I do I just drink some water or have a little bit of a protein bar and I’m good to go for another 6-8 days. It’s crazy, I know. But today I weighed myself; 40kg. At the beginning of the year I was around 50-55kg. It’s insane. The concerning part is what started happening lately. Last time I ate I couldn’t hold it in. I didn’t want to throw up, I really didn’t but about an hour after I ate I had extreme pain in my abdomen as well as bloating. I ignored it. Soon after I started feeling nauseated to the point where I was afraid to open my mouth because I knew it would all come out. I ran to the restroom, as I predicted, it all came out. It was violent vomiting. I was stuck there for about half an hour until it just all spilled out. I didn’t want to eat after that. The likelihood of it happening again was too high so I just went back into fasting. It’s happened 3 times now. I’m scared of eating and I just don’t want to either. Sometimes I feel like I’m close to the end. My heart will beat fast and I feel as I’m about to fall over, yet I don’t. Today marks another week without food.

172,Double_Buffalo,1543681076,a24a9c,"Hello this is my first time posting here so I apologise if you see a lot of questions like this.

So over the past 10 months my younger sister recently became heavily anorexic rapidly. Things that so bad that she was taken to a special young people's clinic where she boards there and part of the problem is is that her program requires her to make weekend visits back home which she hates. It's like she's become so institutionalized and used to their way of dealing with things and the very thought of going back home is so intimidating for her. The moment she steps foot in the house she refuses to eat and drink point blank and so she gets sent back home immediately.

I really want to help her by I just cannot understand this logic whatsoever. Tge problem is I just get so impatient with her way thinking and just how much do stress she's course this family unnecessarily. I don't wanna make it sound as if I'm being aggressive at all and I really don't want to be like that. It's just, why is it just so hard to eat something it's not that hard. I understand I'm posting in the community who face similar challenges. How can I be a supportive brother to her.

I guess part of the problem is that I'm not a very patient person if I'm honest and trying to be around her is such a challenge when I'm back home. I couldn't imagine what Christmas is going to be like now and I'm absolutely dreading it.

What advice would you give to someone in my position? I understand that it's easier said than done with this ""just eat something"" proposition but it really is the case where they've taken something so simple and trivial, made it so hard unnecessarily - I just don't get it.

Take it from a guy with no eating disorders whatsoever.

I want to start with 6 days of almond milk (13 cals/100ml), then go over to soy milk (33 cals/100ml) and then try more solid foods like unsweetened soy yogurt (43 cals/100g).

200,themassivelegend,1545180419,a7h9j5,"Hey all.

Lately I have been obsessively checking nutrition facts, have started exercising every day, have tried eating less and etc.

It all started with me trying to just cut off unhealthy foods, which I did and I am proud of that but it has gotten worse. My BMI is completely normal, it's even kind of close to being underweight but it is not quite there. I know that being underweight is just as bad as being overweight.

But I haven't been able to stop feeling guilty after every single time I eat whether it's fruits and veggies, oatmeal, rice, meat, anything really. 

It makes me feel extremely depressed and I cannot stand seeing myself from the side in the mirror. I look so wide.

203,niftykittens,1544984921,a6rgb9,"I want to share some mental exercises I do in regards to my perception of control. I know control is such an important issue for many of us here. I hope these ideas can be of use to someone. 

Sometimes when the voice of anorexia gets to be too loud, it’s easy to fall into the pattern of viewing it as a separate entity, one that’s controlling me. All this serves to do is to reinforce the illusion that I don’t have control, which as we all know makes the problem worse. Something that’s helped me to stay on track with recovery after almost two years after my hospitalization/therapy is to think of my anorexia as a tool of sorts. This tool for me takes the form of a double edged sword. It’s an ineffective tool that allows me to pretend to tackle my problems while at the same time hurting myself. But the amazing thing about holding a tool is that you have a choice to put it away and not use it. You can choose a different, perhaps less flashy but far more appropriate tool to solve the issue at hand. And the more I’ve chosen these more appropriate tools, the less I’ve felt the need to reach for the double edged sword. At times the thought of it even seems laughable in comparison to the love and compassion for myself I’ve slowly gained by choosing other things. Easier said than done, I know, but viewing an eating disorder in this light helps to give perspective about the control that I do have in those tough moments and give a clearer picture of what I may really need. It also helps to remove the shame that comes with choosing to use my ED, because instead of “failing,” I’ve now just “used a tool that wasn’t helpful.” So when I fall, which I do, I’m able to stand back up again instead of relapsing. 

The second thing that I want to share is a visualization that I do when I start to feel pulled in too many directions. Abusive people in my past, my job, my perception of other people’s judgment, and my social obligations are examples of things that I perceive as pulling on me or taking away my choice in things. Like anyone, I feel trapped if I’m under the impression that I don’t have choices or control, and the ensuing desperation can make falling back into anorexia more tempting than usual. To help mitigate my perception of control, I close my eyes and picture all the control I have as a flame inside of me. I then imagine that in order to lend someone else my control, I would have to light a candle with the flame and send it off to them, but that it’s still attached to me by a string. I look around in my visualization and see where my candles have floated. Perhaps one has floated to my significant other, who I’ve tried to make responsible for my emotional satisfaction. I gently pull that candle back and put the flame back inside of myself. (This prevents unnecessary resentment in your relationships, by the way). Perhaps I’ve let my abusive parent’s words from my childhood get to me. I pull the candle back from that parent. You do not need to be giving power to your abusers, whether they’re still in your life or not. I pull the candles back from my friends, my coworkers, the pretty model on a magazine, the stranger who gave me a weird look on the street, and anything that I feel is “pulling” me. I imagine that pulling the candles back doesn’t hurt the other person and the only thing that it affects is my perception of the control over myself and my actions that I inherently have - the kind of control that is a part of me and belongs to me. I do this visualization several times a day if I need to and at any time (at work, in the shower, on the metro, etc.). It really helps me, and even if it doesn’t work out for you, I’d encourage you to create your own unique ways of coping.

208,CrispyFriedCommunist,1545972768,aa73v1,"Hey there, I hope you all are doing well.

I’ve been steadily recovering from anorexia after  about a year or so of it’s mental torture. I’ve gained quite some weight (lowest point of the year was 90 and now I’m at my highest at 112) 

I think I would be doing great right now, I would be very happy. I am eating anything and everything I can get my hands on. I ate 3 piping hot bowls of white rice with sauce today, and loads of Hershey’s chocolate and even a Starbucks coffee. I am scared to check my weight but I know it’s not 108, 109– I’m guess I’m at about 110 or 112. (I’m somewhere between 5’2-5’3) 

I was going great for a while until my aunt who’s 27 started losing tons of weight. Now she’s my height and weighs around 112-113. I know this because she does what I used to do when I was deeply anorexic. There’s only one scale in the house and I see her sneak in and use it; today I caught her and asked what she was doing and she said “just checking my weight”

Now I feel like this is some sick joke. I am finally recovering and now my aunt is falling in the same thing as me. Now she’s my same weight. Now she watches what she eats, eats considerably less than I do and probably less than once a day. I feel terrible that now I might not be able to recover with another suffering and losing weight right in front of me.

I wish I was her size— she is thinner Than me although my weight is a bit less— her legs are skinny and mine are thick. I hate that she is thinner than me with a sick kind of envy and I don’t know why this is what I feel. Because she is doing what I wish I could do effortlessly — she is thin easily. And I am not. I don’t know what to do.

I don’t think that you can really explain this much— one of my other friends visited Africa, where he says that the women there are happy with their butts, their thighs, no matter how thick, because that’s how women are built. And it’s true.

All women I realize are very different, but you cannot tell me women weren’t meant to gain a little extra in their tummy area, in their thoughts, in their butts, their arms, their face— that is us, we retain fat a little easier, but to strive for this false ideal is one created by years of patriarchal, European standards of what is aesthetic to look at.

Recently i was flabbergasted to find out a vacation friend of mine lost her life to an eating disorder and it hit me more than i could have expected. Loneliness, fear, maybe even hate towards friends family or yourself could be part of your daily existence living with an eating disorder.

I am a chef from the Netherlands and i am wondering how many people here would like to be part of a whatsapp-group were we can have briefly consultation about what problems you are facing maybe even that particularly day or moment. 

I am doing this for all those men and woman who are in need of support from like-minded people so that we learn from each other and just give each other strengt by being open and honest and do your story. I as a chef can help with concrete tips about nutrition, sustenance and food recipes/food habits. I think we are able to give each other these tips as a matter of fact to stimulate one another to make the right choice.

The first time I’ve realized this was like in October 2018. She also exercises very excessively. She probably workouts 3 hours a day almost every day of the week. And those workouts are intense. And I noticed that a lot of her health projects were Anorexia and that she would always do thorough research on it. (I just feel like she was tying to find information for herself in a way but I could be wrong) She sometimes said to me that she is Anorexic when one of her other friends asked her about it. But laughed that off.

Long story short - I don’t know if I actually even have anorexia. People used to joke I had it in high school cuz I was always thin. But I have noticed when I get depressed (not officially diagnosed - but no better way to explain it) I don’t want to eat. I either don’t get hungry or I just don’t feel like eating anything to satisfy my hunger. I am not overly concerned about being fat, although if I eat too much at once I may worry about it. But that is not my reason for not eating (usually - I may skip a meal to retain my figure since I don’t work out but I just really want to drive home that this isn’t the main reason I don’t eat).

Anyways I have been pretty depressed this entire year (haha I know it’s only been 9 days but that’s how it’s been 😅) and I have been noticing a HUGE drop in my appetite. I am already underweight, although I gained some more during the holiday season (still underweight tho), and my usual (pre new year) diet consists of maybe a light breakfast item, usually bread based, a small personal pizza french bread thing for lunch with a Coca~Cola, and then nothing for dinner. Maybe some take out if I feel like driving out of my way. On the weekends I don’t even get out of bed so I usually go as long as I can without eating, then after I feel terrible I may order some food to be brought to me. 

However recently I’ve found myself not even wanting to eat that much. I have had a single (not a pack) pop tart for breakfast, skipped lunch entirely, and had nothing for dinner. I have had trouble sleeping and overall just haven’t been feeling “up to it” emotionally or physically. I am becoming more tired, apathetic, and getting little headaches/stomach pains more than usual. I usually experience these symptoms anyways but I eat my “normal” amount and I’m fine (I have been living this way for a long time). I also have noticed a huge jump in not being able to pay attention to something for a long time, just needing to randomly rest for no reason, and a lack of focus since the new year...

My boyfriend is always worried I’ll end up in the hospital for my eating habits and I genuinely think he is being overreactive. But ever since this new year I’m starting to wonder if I may actually end up hurting myself.

Can anyone give me some sort of advice? Are these side effects of not eating or something else? Is there something else I should be watching out for in case it does get serious?

284,snevino,1547073193,aec9f4,"Hi! (A bit long post ahead)

I don't have Anorexia, but I am getting more and more concerned for a friend of mine. I know you shouldn't say so without knowing a lot about it, but she is showing all the signs of an eating disorder and has lost 15kg in 6-12 months. She struggles with anxiety, depression and struggles with hurtful thoughts about her brother who is overweight. As for herself, she is on the brink of being extremely underweight. Ahe is quite young and I live far away from her so I don't get to see her that often. But I want her to get better. So, the queston is: How should I support and help her? Is there anything I should avoid talking about? How should I react when she tells me things like she hasn't eaten for days? She recently asked me how many calories there is in a chewing gum. What to say? State the facts and let it be? Assure her it's safe? She has also told me she sometimes wants to eat, but she can't as she says. What can I say to this that may help her?

TL; DR 
I suspect a friend of mine has Anorexia Nervosa, how should I go forward in helping her? When she tells me she hasn't eaten anything for days, how should I react?

I've had some kind of undiagnosed eating disorder since I was a child. I have since then struggled, going through phases of ED behaviour but it would only last a few days and it would only happen every few months. I was receiving treatment for depression but didn't mention any of the ED behaviour, as I am such a mess of issues I thought I should focus on the 'depression' because everything just made me sad. I now have stepped back and evaluated the situation, and I see it seems more like I display symptoms of Manic depression/bi-polar. This would explain to me why I felt like such an unbalanced mess, and why I have 'phases' of self-destructive behaviour. The last few weeks, I have had it bad. Frankly feeling like I'm on drugs at times. Can't sleep, big plans, insane mood swings, self-harm and ED behaviour again. However, worse than its ever been. I've been on proana sites and made a folder of thinspo, starving myself on water and the bare minimum to get through the day without fainting.

305,Sunshine-Fox,1547854984,ahgi5b,"For about a year I severely restricted calories; I'd overestimate how much I ate as a result. I'd jot down 1200 but it was more than likely 900 or so. Occasionally I'd binge at a restaurant or on a long weekend. As a result I went from 180 pounds to 130. As time went on I noticed I was very fatigued and my hair started growing in dry and brittle. I also developed ridged nails and black circles under my eyes. But I kept going. 

In August of 2018 I moved and started eating how I wanted; a bagel with hummus in the morning and a plain sandwich (veggie patty and bread, no greens) in the afternoon with a black coffee. I didn't have fruits or greens most days and would fast for a minimum of 36 hours a week. At some point I stopped losing weight and maintained. 

Forward to December; I developed 24 hour brain fog, dizziness, lightheaded, and overall weakness, which I'm still experiencing today. Sometimes the ground feels as though it's moving under me and other times my head feels unstable on my body. I think I might be severely nutrient deficient but I'm not sure.

Now that I'm an adult it's even less, if I feel hungry at all. I definitely restricted myself a lot more after I moved out as well due to my weight being pretty high. 

I don't know if this is anorexia or another eating disorder. But the thought of food makes me anxious. I will be up to eating something, but about halfway through have a panic attack and end up puking it all up. I'm very lost as to if this is even the right place to ask.

So I have been battling anorexia for well over a decade, I went through a long battle with addiction that I used as a ""bandaid"" to combat my eating disorder. I recently got out of treatment for addiction and I'm sober for probably the first time in a decade. Great right? No. All my eating disorder behaviors came back *hard* thing is I don't still have the body dysmorphia, I don't look in the mirror and feel fat or anything, I think I look like shit and too thin. Yet, I can't stop starving myself. It's been 10 days since I've eaten, in the past 12 I may have had 2 bowls of cereal and 2 vitamin waters? I want to be able to eat but I can't bring myself to consume anything but water and a single black coffee.


I seriously feel like I'm going to drop dead because my body is rejecting anything I put in it when I have tried to eat, now I'm just throwing up water. I'm afraid my electrolytes are out of whack, but I can't bring myself to drink a Pedialyte. I tried CBD oil for the first time 2 or 3 days ago and made it through daytime without getting sick, but still couldn't eat. My behavior is so fucked up that I can't try a single 1 of the CBD gummies I bought because I can't bring myself to open my mouth and consume something even that tiny.

It's entirely behavioral and I don't know what to do. When I have been in ED treatment a lot of it focused on the body dysmorphia, but not so much on the strictly behavioral. If anyone has tips or links to resources for the behavioral bit, I'd really appreciate that. I'm not ready to die, especially not like this.

347,HappyStrawberry29,1548271584,aj3eh4,"Background
I was anorexic as a child and into high school. It wasnt until I hit 20 that I decided to take control of my life and not just my meals and I recovered and actually got overweight. Legitimately overweight like maybe I should diet type overweight. I was finally happy with my whole life and saw my expanding waistline as proof that everything was finally good. Then I got engaged to an amazing man, literally he is wonderful. Still all good until last May when I picked up my wedding dress and saw the photos of me in it. Cue extreme anxiety and self consciousness at my 220+ lbs. The next month we bought a house and started rehabbing it, plus DIYing all the stuff for my upcoming wedding the next spring. I began IF and then cutting out sugars, then cutting out carbs. All in the name of being a healthy skinny bride and not this whale in a white dress. 
Fast forward to now. I've lost ALOT of weight and I've been strict about my diet and such.

357,waystosaygoodbye33,1548153583,ailn1d,"I’m curious if anybody else here grew up with stomach issues, which they think contributed to their ED. My first memory is of binge eating, and I came to find that over the years, I was more predisposed to binge eating as my stomach would “randomly” get upset, causing me to eat whenever I could manage it. Just now - at the age of 26 - I am learning what my stomach issues may be and are finding a solution. 

As a teen/young adult, I knew food would make my stomach volatile - and stress more so. Knowing such, I found it much easier to embrace disordered eating patterns as it was less likely to upset my tummy if I wasn’t eating or binge eating. I think this was a significant factor in my developing an ED, as when things got stressful I already had a poor relationship with food. 

Anybody else have this experience?

358,Gingyshae,1548132301,aij9tz," 

As a child, I loved nothing more than myself and I wanted everyone to know me-my best friend. I was always wearing sequin-covered dress up clothes, or whatever would catch the eyes of everyone around me. I was definitely a shy kid, but I didn’t care if anyone thought that I looked stupid, or weird. I was just happy to express myself and be alive. My self-image was thriving. Yet, recently I’ve keep finding myself wondering how I went from being that bold kid to being the girl who can’t recognize her own reflection.

I don’t really remember how things got to be like this. One day I was eating and laughing like a normal person, and then all of a sudden, I slipped off the rails and lost all control. 

Control.

That is the single word that taints my mind whenever I think about what my life has become. I keep stating that I’m doing these things to myself because it gives me a sense of control.  I am consciously making the decision to not eat and I’m following through with it. For once in my life, I’m accomplishing something. I am telling my body what it can and can’t do. That choice is mine to make.  However, in reality I know that I’m more helpless than I’ve ever been.

I honest to God cannot get myself to eat. The anxiety of what repercussions will occur afterwards fills my veins with blind terror. If I consume any food, my entire world will fall apart. All of the progress that I’ve made towards becoming thin will disappear. Food has easily become my greatest source of distress. There’s no joy in eating. It only makes me hate myself more. It’s a nightmare that I just want to be over as soon as is starts.

                I have been diagnosed with an eating disorder. I completely resent that. I personally don’t feel like it’s that bad most of the time. I eat 100-250 calories a day-vitamins included, burn off 330 from running and I still have enough energy to feel okay and be happy. I’ve adapted to it. However, there are the horrendous days where I loathe not only food, but my entire life. My entire body aches, the people around me drive me up the walls; I become a bitter version of myself who wants to either be skinny or be dead.

                So many parts of what make me wonderful have been sacrificed in order for me to achieve my sadistic goal. My body no longer produces a menstrual cycle. I shiver when I’m in an 85 degree room. Just yesterday I was brushing my hair like usual and a ginormous clump fell out. While it broke my heart, it also motivated me. It made me feel as though my illness was validated. Other things that have occurred include; extremely dry skin, chronic constipation, excessive headaches, mood swings, passing out from exhaustion, cramps, random bruises, heart palpitations, and a rectal prolapse. Yeah my rectum literally fell out of my body, but not even that was enough of a reason for me to stop. The only thing that can stop me at this point is death.

Multiple people have asked me what my ultimate goal weight is, and the truth is that I don’t have one. Originally, I just wanted to be 130 pounds. I was supposed to hit that weight and then just stop. However, when I did finally reach that I still saw myself in the exact same way that I did when all of this started. I couldn’t see a difference in my appearance. It was as though no weight loss had occurred. So I kept pushing myself. I’m still going and I intend to keep doing so until I see a difference. 

Looking at my reflection is exhausting and scary for me. Truthfully, I don’t know what I look like. I see a face in the mirror, but it doesn’t look like me. It’s as though a duplicate of me was made but it’s slightly different. Something is off, but I don’t know what. This is probably the most depressing part of everything that’s happening. It means that I didn’t just fuck up my relationships with everyone around me, but I also fucked up my relationship with myself. I’m living in a stranger’s body.  I miss who I used to be. I miss her so much.

It’s been so long since I’ve actually felt alive. Back when I was younger my soul was overflowing with hope. No matter how bad things got I knew that they’d always get better. Nowadays everything feels pointless. I definitely still get moments of hope where I feel like I can eat and live like a normal human again, but then at the end of the day I realize that I can’t even get myself to eat 400 calories and I’m stuck in this endless loop of agony. I really do want to get better, but if I do I want to remain skinny. There’s also a part of me that doesn’t feel like I deserve to recover. I’m not thin enough and things aren’t as bad as they could be. I have an average BMI so how on earth could I have anorexia? I’m not sick enough. These are the thoughts that always cause me to sink further into my disorder. They make me relish in being ill. Trust me; I know that’s absolutely sickening. Yet, I can’t really bring myself to care.

I don’t really know where I’m supposed to go from here. The best thing that I can do right now is remind everyone else of how beautiful they are. I’m going to make sure that both my loved ones and enemies are taking care of themselves and eating. My greatest fear is that someday my niece could fall into this behavior pattern.  So I’m going to try my hardest to help her see the radiant young woman that she is. I hate my eating disorder with every fiber of my being, but I’m too scared to let it go. I guess I’m just going to have to learn to cope yet again.

361,ThingImustConfess,1548002188,ahz6kd,"I just want to say that I'm not looking for advice, just need to vent.

I've been dealing with disease for about seven year or so. Started in highschool, but I managed to make recovery after I got away from the social pressure one gets from their peers. Was in recovery for nearly three years until my life fell apart. Lost my home, job, car, and my sister passed away. I went back to my old ways. I felt I didn't have control over my life so I turned back forward managing my weight.  It was the one thing I had control over.

Fast forward through multiple suicide attempts and hospitalizations and we get to the holidays. It had been a year and a half since I relapsed that I made a mental break through. I had be living on the government for my food, but I was only spending a small portion of what I was given. That, and the constant worry and pressure from family led me to decide to recover once again. 

I had been making good progress from Christmas up until last week. I hadn't received my food benefits for January. When I when to the Public Aid office they told me three things. First, I hadn't received my benefits from December either, I just had money left from the months before. Second it was a result of the government shutdown. And third, I probably wasn't going to be accepted even though I have no income.

I'd would just get a job, but I'm disabled and can't even function at home let alone in a work environment. I was rejected for disability benefits as most people are their first time applying. So I'm stuck in a hole. Anorexia was causing problems with both my physical and mental health, on top of the many other health concerns of mine. I was working to fix that, but now I can't afford to. 

Suicidal thoughts are coming back, and I'm giving up hope that I'll ever get better. It appears that I'm just meant to be a failure. Feeling quite worthless. I don't really even care that much. I still have the desire to loose weight, and I do want to die. This might just make sure one or both of those happen. I'm just afraid because I've tried starving myself to death, and it was a slow and painful experience. I also don't want to leave my cats behind, but that's about all that keeps my tethered to the land of the living.

When I got to high school I hadn't been working out in a while and while I wasnt fat or even technically overweight, I knew I was out of shape and wanted to get back in shape. I found out about dieting and I started with the best intentions, trying my hardest to stay healthy while also shedding some pounds. For a while it was great, I felt better, it was easier to work out, and I was getting some great muscle tone. Somewhere along the line though, I went from eating 1200 cal a day + more when i excercised, to eating &lt;800 a day, regardless of exercise. I lost an end date for my cut and the goal wasnt a specific weight, just to lose it. Around this time the constant restriction led to binge eating, so I would lose no weight and try to eat even less. Then i started noticing things like i would feel nauseous more often, and i was having a harder time breathing while working out and got dizzy. What inspired my friends and boyfriend to intervene was I had finished working out, but my heart rate refused to go back down for an hour, during which I still had trouble breathing. They convinced me to try and maintain my body weight.

Flash forward to now, where I am maintaining, but I definitely still want to lose weight. Sometimes I even restrict calories for a day before I tell myself to stop. I still have a hard time looking in the mirror and I hate my stomach to the point where sometimes i wont do stuff with my boyfriend because I ate and I dont want him to see.

Well, I felt proud that I was going to have two pieces for dinner. I didn't eat anything for lunch, just had some tea, but I knew I planned on eating that pizza for dinner.

When it showed up, it didn't look as tall as I remembered it, but I didn't question it. When I took a bite, it didn't taste like the other times we had gotten it. It just tasted like pizza.

I couldn't even eat a whole piece, it was just too gross.  I tried to think of something else to have instead, but I just couldn't. Nothing sounded good and I didn't have the option to cook anything really, or I would have missed out on what was going on.

I'm just so mad that I planned on eating dinner and acting like I could do it just to have everything go wrong.

376,fernand_0h,1548784465,al2lyu,"Hi, long time follower (not really, like a month maybe) first time poster. 

I have been ""recovered"" bulimic w/anorexic tendencies for about 4 years, but have had short bouts of -almost- relapses. These usually include hiding and taking diet pills or over exercise with mildly restrictive caloric intake.

But lately I've started a new job and feel i'm falling more into it than i have in the past. I'm taking 2 different diet pills daily, even knowing that ANY are not good for anyone at all, restricting heavily, basically living off of caffeine, thankfully not purging.

I take medication for bipolar disorder, and I see a nurse every 3 months to check in on how the medication is doing. They take my vitals every time, and I feel like I'm competing with myself every time, because it's really the only time I'm weighed. Every time I'm there, my nurse asks how my appetite has been, how I've been feeling,  and I always say ""good"".

I'm athletic, I run and play a team sport, and I'm starting to feel weak, and I KNOW why, but it's not enough to make me stop. 

So here I am, a 30 years old adult, lying to my fiance, my nurse, and my teammates. I don't want to lie, I don't like hiding things, but saying I'm not doing well is harder than keeping the lie going. I hate myself. 

I don't want advice, I just wanted to tell someone. Thanks. ","Failing recovery, sizable vent",https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/al2lyu/failing_recovery_sizable_vent/,1548806065.0,2019-01-29 11:54:25

The first time it happened, I was hospitalized shortly before and dealing with nerve pain from anorexia. He understands that and is supportive. He knows I don't do it on purpose. He would NEVER make me feel guilty about sex. But I do it to myself.
I drank too much, didn't eat, and don't even remember any kind of sex. Woke up naked and tried to remember if anything happened (again gotta stress my boyfriend would never take advantage, this is about me falling asleep at the worst times) apparently we started to fool around and I passed out. He stopped (duh) and I woke up later wondering if we actually had sex because my brain is so dull now from starvation, figured if I did something, it was my choice and can't remember. But when he awoke he told me I fell asleep again.
And a whirlwind of guilt and, ""why TF can't I eat enough to have sex with the man I love? He must feel so snubbed and I never meant to"" and how if I truly loved him, I'd eat enough/drink less so I could be intimate with him.

I just want advice on how to approach, other than drinking less and eating more. I know that. But how to explain all of this. This was a lot to get out and I'm not sure anyone could stay silent that long to listen to me.

\- i go through periods of time where i binge eat chips and a bunch of gross shit and then i feel pretty guilty and just kinda not eat as much for the next few days.

402,its_showbiz_baby,1549483335,anutpj,"For me personally, this mindset taught to me at my treatment center last year has changed my whole perspective on my own recovery. 

I’ve been dealing with a multitude of eating disorders since I was eleven years old. I know the pain, the confusion, and the chaos that comes with behaving in a way that is slowly killing you.
That perfection that you’re looking for, or imperfection, that allows you to tell yourself that what you’re doing is okay is beyond wrong. And the thing is, you probably know deep down that what you’re doing is wrong. 

I knew, even though it felt good, the fact that I was hiding what I was doing was a blaring sign that I knew it was wrong. That fear makes it beyond impossible to reach out for help when you think that you’re going to be shamed by it. After all, as many people know, this isn’t the same as being diagnosed with cancer.

This is a choice, you can either choose to get better or choose your eating disorder over your relationships. This is the harsh truth that I’ve come to realize.

I was taught about the “starving brain” and how it can cloud your judgments, making it nearly impossible to think you can change what you’re doing. If you’re already entangled in your eating disorder, it can be so hard to be able to change what you’re doing by yourself. Asking for help can be so so scary, but it is also so so worth it. You might not see it now, it took me years to realize this, but your medical team is on your side, it’s not supposed to be a battle.
	
I fought for months with my medical team, with my family, with myself. It just ended up being exhausting and no help at all. I repeatedly told myself in my head that this was not a choice, but I also told myself that I could just go right back to my eating disorder after all of this was done. If it really isn’t a choice, then why did I have that thought? That I could just choose to go back to the thing that was killing me? I didn’t want to die, I wanted to live so badly.

And I am living and am fully present in everything that I experience. I got my first apartment, I have an amazing boyfriend, and my own dog who I named after the treatment center that saved my life. I still struggle, but I’ve come to the point where the joy and happiness in my relationships outweigh the “high” that came from my disorder. I thought that I deserved to suffer, that I was bad and not worth it, and that felt good somehow in my messed up mind.

My mind is so much clearer now, and while everyone’s experience is different, I hope this helps somebody out there. And if you’re the one suffering, I am so fucking sorry. Please, please get help so that you can start living your life again.

Life is so beautiful and so are you. I hope you see that soon.

I turn on my phone and all I see are beautiful women who I will never ever look like, or even worse, actual women I know whose beauty I could never hold a candle to. I haven’t put on an outfit and felt happy with my body in years... I don’t remember how it feels to love myself.... sometimes I feel like restricting is the only option left to look better... 

To those who have recovered... Will I ever love myself again? Or will I always be like this, obsessing over myself and every flaw no matter how small? Do I need to go back to therapy? Why can’t I love myself?

&amp;#x200B;

I've posted here before, but I kind of need to rant.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an eating disorder and suffer from severe anxiety and depression. I was hospitalized for 3 weeks for the anxiety/depression and got out on Thursday Jan 31. During this time, my eating disorder got worse, but I was on a general psych ward, so the doctors were not trained specifically about eating disorders (at least not a lot). I started restricting food on January 20, due to my eating disorder and managed to eat some soup on Jan 24. I almost immediately vomited up the soup (induced vomiting due to disgusted feeling).

From Jan 24th, to today (Feb 3), I have not eaten anything (and keep it down without vomiting).

I've started getting super dizzy, my vision blacks out for minutes at a time, and my heart feels like it's about to explode. I can barely walk without support and I had to run to catch a bus (it was like a 10 meter run) on Friday and I was so close to passing out.

I went to the hospital on Saturday due to the heart pain and palpitations, and severe weakness. They did blood tests, vitals, and an ECG and they said everything was normal and sent me home after giving me an IV because I hadn't eaten in 9 days. They said I was medically stable, gave me some tylenol for the pain, and said here was no reason to keep me in the hospital emerg.

**Here's the problem:** My heart still hurts like nobody's business, it's so bad it makes my breath catch, I can't walk without feeling faint, my head aches and I feel dizzy just walking a couple steps. I can't keep any liquids or solids down (including an electrolyte drink, which is supposed to help).

WHAT THE HELL DO I DO NOW. The hospital won't help me. Feels like I have to be emaciated in order for them to help me. I feel like I'm dying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to an outpatient mental health (general not eating disorders specifically) program next week, but I'm on a waiting list for an eating disorder program but that's 8 months of a wait. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I have an eating disorder, havent eaten in 10 days, can't keep food down and have major chest pain, dizziness, blacking out of vision and such.

So I’ve been restricting food for 9 days now (since Jan 24), meaning I literally have not eaten a bite of food since then. 

I ended up having jello this morning- vomited that up.

I really felt bad (so weak I had to crawl around and could only stand using a cane my parents had lying around), my vision would black for minutes at a time and my heart started doing weird things, I guess it was an irregular heartbeat. 

So i told my parents I would have some soup and a small bun, and I just ate that and immediately after I vomited it up. 

I called a nurse helpline this morning and had an assessment and they told me to go to the hospital immediately. But I was just in the hospital for 3 weeks (not for ED but for depression and anxiety). 

I really don’t want to be in the hospital again, they’ll give me an IV or force feed me through a tube. But I can’t seem to eat anything.

Note that these methods can be tested to see if you may have anorexia related hunger issues or other chemical/ hormonal instability such as ghrelin deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, etc.

The explainations are going g to be kept as short as possible without sacrificing info.


List without explainations:

1. Chew gum
2. Light exercise, cardio and abs (SEE DETAILS)
3. Masturbate(SEE DETAILS)
4.Work hard/ do things you enjoy
5. Eat crackers or bread, and other dry foods like peanut butter or cereal
6. Consume acidic and vitamin c rich foods that are mostly natural, lemonade, citrus fruits, etc (SEE DETAILS)
7. Take supplements as needed, like iron or various vitamins

Details section:


1: Chewing gum for a long period of time is known to make some people thirsty or hungry. This mostly has to do with constant stimulation of saliva enzymes like amylaze and pepsin.

2. If you decide to work out make sure you pace yourself, because if you are faced with muscular atrophy or other muscle related symptoms, your body may not be able to keep up if you don't eat as much. Do something like a mix of stretches, crunches, short runs etc.

3. Masturbation should only be considered if muscle atrophy, sex hormone balance, and brain fog aren't a problem. I say brain fog because it's also a result of hormone issues. Be careful.

4. Everything you do yields some sort of chemical reaction in your brain, and getting some good work done or doing things you enjoy activates dopamine release, which is often associated with the reward of food. So there you go.

5. Eating even small amounts of dry foods with maybe a sip of water afterwards will make some people hungrier, again dealing with saliva enzymes.

6. Lemonade especially along with naturally acidic foods are known to make you hungrier.

7.this is obvious.

Review: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-018-5159-2

&gt; **Abstract**
&gt; 
&gt; Rapidly accumulating evidence supports the important role of gut microbiome in the regulation of mood, behaviour, appetite, gastrointestinal symptomology, and nutrient metabolism. These are all core features frequently altered in individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). Current treatment recommendations for AN support the use of high-calorie diets as an essential part of nutritional rehabilitation, commonly achieved by elevating the fat content of the diet. However, in contrast to this approach, there is accumulating evidence suggesting the importance of balanced, high-fibre diets on the gut microbiome. Studies have demonstrated profound differences in the microbial composition of underweight people with AN and those of normal- or overweight individuals. Specific alterations vary widely between studies. It is thus far unclear to what extent the observed differences are brought on by iatrogenic effects of nutritional rehabilitation or the disorder itself. To date, only two studies have investigated the changes in the intestinal microbiota during nutritional rehabilitation and corresponding weight restoration. These studies suggest that the gut microbiome of AN patients was different to healthy controls both prior and following nutritional rehabilitation, though it is noted that these states were associated with lower and higher nutritional intakes, respectively. There is a clear need for further investigation regarding the effects of nutritional rehabilitation on the gut microbiome. Such research would provide insights into the potential role of gut microbiome in modulating the pathophysiology of AN and inform future treatment strategies.

**Takeaway**: Keep a look out for FMT (fecal microbiota transplant) opportunities. Scroll through the recent posts in /r/fecaltransplant to learn more about what the current status of FMT is.

obviously my diet sucks but i DO binge so that’s probs why my hair still grows lol. i take women’s one a day vitamins and i just started natures bounty hair skin and nails vitamins last week. i try to not wash my hair often (maybe 3 times a week). i put coconut oil on my entire head after my shower and don’t rinse it out until the next time i wash my hair. 

-how can i keep my entire head feeling and looking healthy like my roots? 
-are there any hair treatments or products i can use to get my hair feeling soft all the way down to my ends? 
-are there any beneficial nutrients my body and hair needs that i can get from vitamins and not food?
-are there any products that slow down or seal split ends until i’m ready to get a trim in a few months? (i know you can’t reverse split ends, i just don’t want them to keep splitting up my hair shaft)

And even though it’s been more than a day of not eating I just don’t feel hungry. Because when I look in the mirror and see my collarbones and hipbones jut out it takes away my hunger. But it’s getting harder to hide it from people. I went to the doctor yesterday and she started asking questions. “Are you eating? You look weak. Your face has no colour” and I lied saying I’d just been really tired. Exercising has become so hard because i get really light headed. I wish I had control. I wish I could stop. But it’s so hard.

466,madi_45,1551245258,av9ou0,"I have struggled with anorexia for years, it started around the time I turned 13 and I am 22 now. I should have gone to a recovery center when my doctor mentioned it at around age 16 but my mother yelled at him (that's a whole different story). I got into college and after a few mental breakdowns, went to see my first psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with MDD, GAD, and C-PTSD. 
I eventually got on the right medication, thank god, but have noticed it has caused me to gain weight. Or, at least, I blame it on the medication. For context, I weighed around 120 pounds when I first came to college and, as of yesterday, I weigh 155 pounds.
At first I thought I was bloated, normal for a female, but now I realize that it's just my stomach. It's just me. Ican see my stomach poking through my shirt and it is really, really starting to bother me. 
I have no idea how to cope with this. I want so badly to restrict again. I'm terrified of going to a counselor because all they ever want to do is send me to a nutritionist or whatever. I'm not going to one of them. I'm terrified of relapsing. I notice more and more every day how terrible I think I look.

470,suicidal_thottie,1551063921,aug58v,"This might sound dumb, but do you think that anorexia is sort of contagious?

I know this might seem super weird, but I think that that may have been how it started for me. One of my best friends had some super serious issues with her anorexia when she was recovering, and I spent a lot of time around her during that. As much as I hate to say it, and I would never tell her this, but it think was so mentally damaging to see her like that. Seeing her like that may have been one of the big factors that started my anorexia.

I just thought, ""Wow she's so pretty, but she never eats."" 

She has always been really popular and pretty, and she has so many friends. I've never been jealous of her, but rather the lifestyle she has, because I always feel so alone. I always thought it was because of my looks that people don't like me. I still think that. 

I know it would probably be wrong to say that she was the only or biggest factor, though. 

I've always had huge self esteem issues. I suppose I've never really been a big person (the most I've ever weighed is 113 and I'm 5'3""), but I've always hated myself. I would always see pictures on the media of perfect girls with perfect abs and perfect bodies with flat stomachs. I always wanted that.

In fact, I was born with extra organs in my abdomen, which makes it nearly impossible to have a flat stomach or any kind of waist. I always thought that I can never be normal because the dumb mistake that God or whoever made out of my body. I figured out that starving myself worked though, and in the vexation of long deserved victory over my body, I craved more and more.

Another factor may be that I, at a very young age, was severely voilated. 

I have PTSD from being voilently sexually assaulted. As a result of this, I have never felt clean or worthy. My body has never felt like a home, and I'm not sure that it ever will. I didn't care what happened to me, and I saw my weight as a game, a game that I was winning.

It's unfair to say that my best friend caused me to be anorexic, because it was probably just waiting to happen. However, I don't think that it is false to say that she may have been what lit the spark and determined me.

And it was only like a minute that I was asking the girl how to use it (I know I should know bc I’m youngish but I don’t) and this old man starts raising his voice at me and telling me how I’m holding up the whole line and how rude I am and to think of people other than myself

And he’s still talking shit about me RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME

484,letslonely,1551953528,ayb2lq,"(wow this is absurdly long i'm sorry. but i needed to let these thoughts out somewhere.) 

i hadn't restricted for 3 years, but the past few days i've taken the adderall i've had laying around from before i dropped out of college hoping to supress my appetite, and it's done a splendid job; i hate that i can barely sleep and have been up past 3am (its 5am now and i work tomorrow, yikes) each night but i feel such a sick satisfaction in only being able to eat small portions. i recently gained about 10 pounds from the weight my body had settled at after AN recovery when my depression decided it was bored of decreasing my appetite and instead that i needed to start emotional eating anytime i was sad or bored. 10 pounds isn't a lot but i'm 5'0"" so it makes a difference. the additional fat in my belly, thighs, and particularly my neck/chin are all i can see when i look at myself. i thought i was pretty cute before but now i'm more unhappy every time i catch my reflection. since the emotional eating is new for me i'm so scared i'm going to end up overweight like my father and sister if i don't do something to combat it.

i'm seeing a nutritionist for undiagnosed stomach issues, currently we're trying to figure out how much lactose i can handle so it's been so easy to avoid a lot of fatty cheesey food, because it normally makes me feel lousy anyways. i'm also supposed to work on eating more fruits and veggies since i was only eating one serving a day, and drinking more water. if i started counting calories it would be easy to lose weight like this, i have an excuse not to eat so many foods. the nutritionist knows i used to have an eating disorder but i really don't want to mention i'm restricting before i've even lost those 10 pounds. in our last session she decided we should work on my relationship with food in the next appointment, a month from now. food has always been the enemy, even when i don't have disordered thoughts, my digestive system reacts badly to so many things and we haven't even figured them all out yet. eating anything that's not a very mild 'safe' food fills me with dread and apprehension and i avoid eating in public most of the time in case i feel sick or need to lie down from painful gas. i watch other people fill up their plates, unrestricted, eating everything they want without worrying about how awful it'll make them feel after, and i feel so envious i want to cry. i remember just a few years ago i could eat what i wanted, too. i wish i knew what i did wrong to make my body hate me. it makes me really sad to think i may never be able to enjoy some of my favorite foods like milkshakes or refried beans or pizza again without suffering for it. 

i'm in therapy for my depression, but it's not going well. my current therapist told me, in our last session, around a week ago, that she was ""out of ideas"" for me. though it was kinda devastating and made me more depressed to hear that, i don't think it's her fault at all; i've had 7-8 therapists over the years and never felt like any of the therapy helped me in the slightest. so it feels like it's my fault that it's not working and i'm just wasting my family's money and time by going because i get nothing out of it. i tried over a dozen antidepressants over the years desparatley hoping one would work for me before i gave up on them. i feel like i have no way to get better since therapy and medication are usually how depression is treated and i've been trying both since i was 13 to no effect. i can't remember what it's like to not be depressed.

i feel like i'm never going to be motivated enough to learn to drive and move out of my parents house, it's so overwhelming to think about having to keep up with having my own place. i couldn't handle college. i have a shitty job that doesn't give me very many hours, but other than that i feel like an overgrown 20 year old child. i have no ambitions or plans for my future. i don't want to die, but i dont want to keep living like this forever, i wish i could make some progress. i've been stagnated for almost 2 years. 

i also have recently relapsed into self harm and don't want to tell anyone. it's really embarrassing that i'm still dealing with it. i dont know any other people my age still doing this. i want to quit permanently, i'm tired of the scars that creep further down my thighs with each relapse, but any time i'm struggling and have a particularly shitty day, i stop caring about that and do it again anyways and hate myself more for it. none of my work friends have major mental health issues that i know of and oftentimes all i do is complain about everything anyways so i feel like bringing it up that i'm struggling when nobody ever comes to me with their problems is really attention whorey. i don't want to subject anyone to my bullshit anyways.

nobody has asked me to hang out for a couple of months and i suspect it's because depression has made me kinda unpleasant company lately. i can't invite them to come hang because i live with my parents and my room doesn't have a tv or even any chairs or anything to do, and is an absolute wreck. nobody ever messages me. i haven't felt this isolated since my short attempt at college before i moved back in with my parents. i don't know how to make friends outside of work and i doubt anyone would want to become friends with someone so mentally unhealthy anyways. i dont even know anything i'd find fun and be able to bond with people over anymore. my hobbies and pastimes have kinda died and were replaced with just day after day of laying in bed scrolling through the same 4 apps over and over again and occasionally going outside to smoke. 

maybe things will get better when the spring comes. maybe going outside more when it's warm again and working in our garden will help how down i've been feeling and also keep me from continuing to gain weight. i dont know what to do if that doesn't help me get out of this rut. all i feel like i can manage is to pass the time and wait for something to improve, somehow. 

i mainly just needed to vent and tell someone i'm having a hard time right now, even if it's just internet strangers. tbh i'd be suprised if someone reads this far, but if anyone has been through a similar situation, i'd love to hear what you have to say. or if you have any kind words or encouragement i could definitely use it. i'm not really seeing any light at the end of this tunnel right now.

(20f) I have struggled with disordered eating and my behavior towards food since 10th grade (when I acted out on the thoughts that had been around since I was 9 - I was terrified of the weight I was gaining for some reason but never did much about it). I won't say what I did exactly, but I had lost a large amount of weight in a short amount of time (while still being in a healthy range for my height). The thing is, recovery was forced on me but I wasn't upset about it?

I relapsed a bit three years ago, then settled for a few months only to have it come back maybe 2 or 3 months ago.

The thing about my stuff is that my goal weight is still healthy for my height, and I'm only afraid of gaining when I go over a certain number on the scale. I have a set caloric intake that is actually pretty okay, though there are days where I'll just eat dinner.

I try not to eat when I'm at my mother's, but I'll happiky eat with my boyfriend or with specific friends (just so long as I can work off my intake or stay under the budget).

I don't think what I do now in my recent return to whatever this is is as unhealthy as what I did during my first, I actually think it's still healthy.

Is where I'm at now considered an eating disorder? The fear of gaining enough to put me back over a certain weight? I really wish I could explain in depth but it would be too triggering.

taking double my prescribed dose (40mg Vyvanse which isn’t a dangerous amount so medically it’s fine) pretty much daily and I’m starting to see physical side effects (shakey, fast heart rate etc). I had a super raw session with my therapist this morning and told her that i was abusing my pills and i cried and let it all out and all that but i feel like shit now. she said medically, i can keep with the double dose of my meds until the end of school and then we can get me into treatment or just more support or whatever. I go to therapy once a week and this morning she told me she was going away and won’t be here the next 2 sessions. my mom is also going away next week so i’ll be completely alone at home and won’t have anyone to keep me accountable for anything.

And she always posts that stuff on facebook aswell. From that point, i was wondering if she was just a girl who really wanted to loss weight for whatever it costs(just like everybody wants to lose weight if they are fat) but her doctor diagnosed her wrongly?

I am asking this because if i am wrong i will try to be more helpful, but if i am right, i will stop and let her suffer from ""attentioxia""

I keep hearing my treatment team telling me my diagnosis, that I’m underweight, that I keep dropping, how worried they are 

My heart is working too hard. My liver and kidneys are working too hard. So hard they can’t keep doing it. I know it. They think I don’t understand but I do. It’s not about not understanding. 

I just feel so much big 

I feel like they’re lying to me that I’m dropping weight to try and trick me into eating what I have been

But they tell me it’s down 

They say I’ve lost 10 ibs in a month 

But I’m sure I’m the same. Sometimes I feel like I’m bigger than I was last month 

I hate food now. I used to love it but all it does is make me sad and anxious and angry. Sometimes I just look at food menus on uber eats and I put it in my cart but I never buy anything and sometimes I go to the store and I buy 200$ worth of food but I never eat any of it. Sometimes it goes bad and I have to throw it out.  

When I look up my bmi in the DSM it just says that my ed is “moderate” so if it’s just moderate then it’s not that bad. 

Not bad enough to go to a hospital where girls there will be so skinny and thin and I will be a whale compared to them 

I feel like I need to lose more weight first. I have to lose more before I can go to hospital. I keep saying 5 more ibs... but the number keeps going up 10 more ibs... 30 more ibs but I don’t have that to lose. It scares me. But I feel like I have to keep going 

My NP told me I was going to die if I didn’t gain weight 

I don’t want to die. I want to get better, I do

But really.. I think I would rather die than gain weight, than be fat, than be *fatter*

From the age of 14 until now (21 years old), I have been caught in the cycle of restricting, finally eating something, then purging what little I do eat. I have never been a binge eater. 

In January of 2018 I had to go on a medication that is notorious for weight gain. I was in the grip of a severe drug addiction, and this medication was the last resort to save my life. The medication worked so well for me that it even helped with a lot of the thoughts associated with my eating disorder. I wasn’t so focused on food and calories and weight and I was rarely purging. But as expected, I gained weight. A lot of weight, and very quickly. As a few months went by I went into a full blown panic one day when I had stepped on the scale and saw the highest number that I had ever gotten to. This immediately threw me into my old mindset and my old ways. 

I began restricting to the point of starvation and purging when I felt it was necessary to get the weight off of me. I did lose a majority of the weight I had gained from the medication, but I am still at a normal weight. I recently started seeing a psychiatrist that I used to see in 2017. He knew back then about my eating habits and brought it up at our appointment last week. He told me that I have bulimia. I told him that I don’t believe it could be bulimia, considering the fact that I never binge. He told me it is still bulimia. I’m angry. I feel as if just because I am not underweight that he doesn’t see it more as anorexia, or as EDNOS/OSFED. 

Is this a valid concern to think that I was given the wrong diagnosis? Or is it just my ED mind telling me that my disorder is only valid if I am underweight? I am so confused and tired of feeling like nobody sees how badly I’m struggling because I’m not underweight. Does anyone else feel this way or have any similar experiences with doctors misdiagnosing?

519,btmvideos37,1552401896,b08kkp,"So this may come off as creepy or just dumb or panicky, but it’s been eating me alive and I need to talk to someone about it.

Here’s the story, so my friend was in the hospital for around a week in December. That doesn’t necessarily mean anorexia obviously, but there’s a few things that kinda lead to me believe it to be the case. So first of all, I’m still in high school, and I [male] have really strong feelings for her and I care about her a lot. So one day she just didn’t go to school, her sister said she was sick, whatever, thats fine. She later didn’t show up the next day as well (Friday). Same thing, I didn’t bother me that much, it’s only two days. However, that night I got a text from her sister saying she was in the hospital, and she said that she’s telling me because I’m a close friend, but it’s personal so she doesn’t wanna tell me why. 
So I get worried as shit as soon as I see this. Now, I have anxiety, OCD, and Tourette’s, so once something is in my mind I can’t get it out. I immediately start racing through every possibility as to what “personal” reason she’d be in the hospital. Because to me, for 90% if illnesses, I wouldn’t mind if people knew or not. 
So anorexia or malnutrition came across my mind, because I know she’s really thin and she refuses to show her arms (wears sweaters during any temperature). 
However, a week later, we text, she says she’s coming home. I tell her that she has my full support and that if she ever wants to talk about it, I’m here. Still though, she didn’t wanna talk about it.
Here is when my mind starts racing even more.
It’s obviously been months since she came back, and it seemed like there was no recovery period. 
What the hell kinda sickness is bad enough to land you in the hospital for a week, is personal, yet you’re literally fine immediately after. She hasn’t gone back to the hospital. Like (despite her seeming like a very happy person), a suicide attempt was also on my radar on top of anorexia, but same thing, I’m assuming it’d take you a long time to recover, and there be some after math, not just a week and bam! Depression cured. So I quickly crossed that out. 
And obviously anorexia is a psychological thing, and I’m fully in support of all the people recovering. So I know that even though I’ve never seen anyone call her overweight and I think she’s perfect, there could be something making her think she is. 
For the longest time, I just said that she was malnourished. I deduced that it was regardless of anorexia. She just happened to not eat properly, for on an IV drip, started eating right and was back on track.
The problem is, she follows (this is the creepy part potentially since I was looking at who she follows) a bunch of anorexia recovery pages and likes all their posts.
So, from that, what do you guys think. Sorry for the length, and sorry if it doesn’t exactly fit, I just don’t know where to post this. 
Have any of you recovered so quickly, or “hid” the fact that you had Anorexia for so long, even after you recovered?
I never saw her skipping meals, she always ate lunch, so I’m really lost.

I tried to get back in track but I couldn't.

My point is, I'm still eating normally, of course I feel like I'm actually eating a lot, but I do hate my body, I wish I was thinner, and yet,  everytime I tried to not to eat, I can't. As if my brain knows what I'm doing and it's trying to prevent it from happening.

In the beginning it was easy (easier). My body was reacting somewhat okay. I had pains and nausea but I managed. 
After a month things went downhill. My body turned against me. 
Constipation and bloating because a daily nuisance. ED thoughts got louder and some days extreme hunger set in.
At the end of the first month the constipation got worse, extreme bloating and abdominal pain accompanied it, along with a large distended stomach. 
Edema. My face puffed up, along with my legs, feet and hands. My body started aching. I felt like I had water balloons tied to me. I was feeling so heavy. 
Today I had a really bad episode. I almost relapsed.
I was getting dressed for the day and decided I’d wear the jeans I was wearing the day prior, today they didn’t close. 
I had given away my scale to my mom to hide. 
I was in this crazy state. 
I needed to know the number. 
I pulled all my clothes from the closet. I broke hangers and ripped some shirts.
In despair I rummaged through her things. 
I NEED TO KNOW.
I found it and without thought I stepped on the scale eager to know the number.
The realization quickly set it. 
Over these 2 months I had/have gained 40 pounds. 
I started hyperventilating, crying historically until I passed out. 
My mother calmed me down. 
But the thoughts are stronger than ever now.

I managed to stay in 20 bmi range for about a year. I have to admit that I felt better in certain ways. Not cold all the time, ability to focus, better skin, not obsessing over meals , just eating whatever I want.

But at the same time I stayed deeply unsatisfied with the physical part of me. I managed to stay healthy only coz I had no body size mirror in my room, did not go out, I did not see other women on daily bases. My coworker is a woman but I always avoided looking at her when we talked, and I managed to get by. I did not look up women online, did not watch TV. In order to avoid comparing. I only read books and played games, watched youtubers (Only male)

Then relapsing process started...It was very slow. Happened over the course of 6 months. I was gradually getting triggered by random things. 
Like male coworker being nasty when commenting on an obese woman. Saying stuff like she shouldn't wear leggings, or go out. I can't stand it when people are commenting weight of other people. Now I mentally blacklisted him. 
I got triggered when a family friend was having a fight with his wife and called her fat, she was skinnier than him. Surely weighted less than 60kg. Wasn't anywhere near being fat. Luckily I rarely see him as he lives in another country. 
I get triggered when people make comments on my body, saying I gained weight or look healthy.

Now I dropped to BMI 17 , and it doesn't seem like I'm about to stop. I got into old bad habits . Bought myself body size mirror, throwing food away, taking pics of food and counting calories. And other stuff I won't mention. 

Lower weight doesn't make me feel any better. My life revolves around food and weight. I no longer play games nor read, I tend to sleep very early. I feel my life wasting away.

As A child I loved eating, it was my passion. But my parents would remind me of what I was. A failure and an oversized child. 

Middle school was terrible. I struggled with obesity for most of it, still having that reminder in the back of my mind that no one would love me or would be attracted to me if I was this way. It subconsciously started to build a bitterness towards my body I would discover in high school. 

I found sports in high school. I started dieting, trying new work out methods, and obsessed over it. I would run in school and at home. Bought a treadmill and abused the shit out of it. I became a vegetarian and would never let myself be full, and only eating the minimum to maintain my body on...... I lost 30 pounds in 2 weeks. I never vomited, I hated the feeling. But i thought about it. 

I went into recovery in senior year, and then started college.... and it’s happening all over again. College is keeping me from being able to control what goes into my body, only limited to quick meals that scream “weight gain”. I buy fruit, eggs, and water. I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches minimally. Sometimes I don’t really eat bc I prefer not to instead of eating the food at the school. I also stock up on granola bars, so the headaches aren’t as bad when the hunger strikes....... 

I have depression on top of it. My boyfriend and i are in a relationship that we know will be over soon, we’re trying to be happy. I had a plan and now im lost, and I’m scared. 

My parents are nagging me that I need to eat more, as well as my best friend and my boyfriend. But how can I when the only thing I want to do is avoid weight gain. Tonight I didn’t eat anything besides nuts, since I spent all day in a bus. When I got to my dorm, my headache and my nausea were killing me... so I ordered chipotle.

Request: So, lately I've noticed that my friend, who I'll call M for now, is having relationship problems with her weight, body image and food. M has never seemed to have any problems until our freashman year of highschool. We're currently in our sophmore year and it's only becoming much worse.

Everyday during our gym class M would exercise non-stop until the class period ended. M would walk out of the gym competely covered in sweat and nearly passing out from exaustion. I remember one day during gym class when M drank some water from the water fountain and told me that the water was causing her to gain weight as she was looking at her body.

Every mourning M walks around the lunch room and claims that it's ""her daily walk."" I never seen M eat any of her food during our lunch period. M will buy food from the lunch line but I'll never see her eat any of it. M will play on her smartphone to keep herself distracted from the temptations of actually eating the food that she just bought.
M once admitted to me, and other students, during our english class that she counts calories during every meal she plans out throughtout the day. M even admitted to me that she has lost so much weight to the point that she's currently underweight.

I want to help M get better but I don't know what to do to help her get better. There were times where I was so tempted to anonymously tip our school through their website about M possibly suffering from an eating disorder, but I didn't tip them.

I've been recovering from anorexia for around four years now. I've gained a lot of weight in those four years, obviously, and being on medications has also caused unwanted weight gain. I've never had stretchmarks, but I now have those. I can't look at myself naked without gagging. I've started to pick up on old habits, downloaded apps I used to use when I was really struggling. I purge every once and a while. So I guess I'm not really ""recovered"" as I had hoped. My friends sister recently made a comment about me now being ""chubby"" and I had a breakdown over it. I know I've gained weight. I know its normal. I know that she's a bit younger and doesn't realize that I see weight gain as a threat. We haven't seen each other in months, so my weight gain is going to seem more drastic to her than it is for me. I know how to go about this in a logical manner, the healthy way. But I'm scared. I get pleasure from feeling hungry again, I've started denying myself meals, I rewarded myself for purging the other night. I'm mentally calculating calories in food again. I look at the nutrition facts and feel my stomach drop when it's more than a certain amount of calories. I know I'm digging myself into a bigger relapse. But I know that with that, I'm going to lose people again with the satisfaction of having the illness to lean on. I feel like everything is spiraling out of control. Like this is the only thing I have again. And again, logically I know it's not. I know I have friends, a relationship with someone I'm terrified of screwing up. But this is slowly grasping me by the fucking throat again and I'm terrified. I guess its good that I'm scared of relapsing.

576,DantesInporno,1552741783,b1s9n1,"My roommate is a fucking insecure dick. To be fair, he doesn't really know about my (21, male) struggle with ana, I haven't really disclosed it with him, despite us being quite close otherwise, because I had a hunch he wouldn't really get it. He is a little overweight and has put in effort into losing weight in the past year or so, but I have had conversations with him about how I'm lucky that my problem is having to eat more, and how most people would rather that than have to eat less. That I am blessed because I have to eat more because I starved myself for so long. This was after I told him that I had just fainted in my bedroom because I hadn't eaten enough recently. I get it, this ED shit doesn't make sense to normal people because it defies normal logic, you're hungry? you eat it just makes sense because it is conducive to existence. But I hate that his insecurities end up attacking me, partly because it makes me want to relapse hard and partly because I remember thinking the exact same shit as him when I was overweight. 

Well, to get to the point--and sorry that I have taken so long to get here, so if anyone is still reading this rambling mess, thank you--last night he grabbed my stomach and said I had been getting fat or gaining weight and kind of shook my stomach fat. I said to him, please don't say things like that to me... and he said ""I know I'm sorry... It's just so not true and so the opposite of the truth because you're so skinny!""

But the fucking truth is that HE'S FUCKING RIGHT AND IT LITERALLY MAKES ME WANT TO DIE. I HAVE BEEN GAINING WEIGHT. I WAS IN A PHP FOR 2 MONTHS AND NOW IM OUT AND GOING NUTS EATING HORRIBLY. all eat now is candy and junkfood and pasta and I try not to think about it, just eat to my cravings because I have been telling myself at least I am eating, even if it isn't the best for me. But I haven't been weighing myself very often, and I have been in denial about the weight I have been gaining. I looked on the scale today and it read 159 pounds. I used to be 132 pounds. I can't believe I let myself get this fat again. I remember when I first started losing weight I told myself I wasn't going to mention anything about dieting or losing weight until someone else noticed it first. I read somewhere that telling someone about your goals can make you less likely to achieve them because you get a small dopamine kick from saying you're going to do something, even if you haven't done it yet. So If I said I was going to lose weight, it wasn't going to happen... Now that someone has noticed my weight gain... It feels so fucking real and traumatic. I really really want to start starving myself again. The worst part is that it will be super hard again because I have fucking hunger signals again.

587,Shunnedo,1553800285,b6mxg0,"  

Hello people, I'm a psychiatrist from Brazil and I want to share some of my experience with ED patients. This is not supposed to be looked at as medical advice, I'm just sharing some points that I think can help some people around here. Sorry for english mistakes if they happen. 

   
 

Family

\- The first thing I do when I diagnose someone with eating disorder is evaluating this person's relationship with family. And, if the patient wants, I talk to the family (or people that live with them) and I highly encourage them to learn about the disorder as much as they can. Very often the family have very low level of information about the disorder and end up doing a lot of harmful things while interacting with the patient. 

\- It's very often that I notice the family members themselves have an anxiety disorder or some other mental disorder. It would be ideal that they were under treatment when that is the case. Of course I don't tell them directly they have to look for treatment or else they get very defensive (and they are right, they didn't ask me to diagnose them)

Medication

\- The medications we currently use the most for eating disorders are antidepressants and antipsychotics.

\- We seek to treat the comorbidities at the same time, that plays a big role in what drug we choose to use.

\- Some psychiatrists choose medications that notably have weight gain as side effects, I am strongly against it because it will make it less likely that the patient will use it and recovery is not about gaining weight.

\- Using stimulants is one of the worse things a person with ED may do to themselves – it makes the disease worse and it also creates another problem to be solved. It is abusing substances that cause addiction and can be just as bad as abusing illegal drugs.

Comorbidities

\- Other common diagnoses in people with ED are borderline personality disorder, major depression, bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, OCD and anxiety disorders in general.

\- Only a psychiatrist will be able to make those diagnosis, and they are very common, so it’s very importante to seek professional help.

\- Everything must be treated together, or else one thing will make the other worse.

Psychological therapy

\- I have had patients with great results with cognitive behavioral therapy (I don’t do it myself), I don’t have experience with other forms of therapy.

\- I believe that for the eating disorder, it is more important than the medication, however the medication can help a lot and can help treating comorbidities.

Hospitalization

\- I see it as absolute last resort.

\- During the hospitalization, I still highly prefer that the patient gets the calories by eating.

\- It is very hard to have the patient feel that we are their ally, and not enemy. They are usually very hostile to us (it’s understandable, the hospitalization is usually against their will)

\- The primary goal of the hospitalization is not full recovery, obviously. It’s just a measure so the person won’t die of starvation.

Gaining weight x Recovering

\- Weight gain is a consequence of the recovery proccess, it’s not recovery itself.

\- Eating disorders are mental diseases. It is much more importante to me that a patient tells me “I am feeling better about myself in the last weeks” than “I’ve gained a few pounds”.

My experience with this subreddit

\- I’ve noticed that every user that I interacted with is from the United States.

\- I’ve noticed that a common problem is the financial aspect of the treatment: Family won’t pay professional help, Family won’t pay for the medications (in cases that the person doesn’t work yet or can’t pay for themselves).

\- I don’t really understand how it is to buy medications on the United States, but people usually buy the original medication rather than it’s copies, which are usually as effective and much cheaper (here in Brazil, if we get prescribed Lexapro, Prozac we can buy other escitalopram and fluoxetine with the same prescription, I don’t understand how it works there)

\- I’ve seen debates about fasting x eating disorders. Fasting itself can be healthy, but not in the eating disorder context: a person who does intermitente fasting (the right way) for example, still eats a normal amount of calories over the time of a week. We must remember that the problem with Anorexia and other eating disorders is not only about the eating habits, but with the mental suffering that originates it.

\- In this subreddit I’ve seen many males suffering from eating disorders, something I very rarely see here (I think it’s more common in United States than it is in Brazil)

\- I usually do not comment on posts here because I feel that the posters usually want to hear from another people suffering from eating disorders.

For my whole life, I've called myself ""fat and ugly"". I've heard that anorexia makes you think that, but I'm still not certain. However, today, everything changed. 

I've tried to lose weight before, and it kinda went well but I lost motivation because I'm still depressed.

But the thing that changed. I usually have a protein shake in the morning. Today? ""I kinda need to lose weight. Maybe I can just skip it for today.""

Then lunch came. I only ate two chicken nuggets, then I gave the rest to someone else. Need to lose a lot of weight, and eating doesn't help. 

Then for dinner, two more chicken nuggets and a very small plate of rice. As I ate it all, it felt like I could feel the weight gain, and how much I dreaded it. So after that, I tried to throw it up. Kinda worked, but not really.

I've tried to limit calories before. But this is going insane. Today it's started with 1000 calories or less, but my body just suddenly designed a whole rules thing that I will slowly eat less and less calories. 

I realized the change, but then it morphed into ""I'm just trying to lose weight! Nothing can be wrong."" and now we're back to me noticing a change.

I want to eat. But my body is telling me ""Don't, eating isn't good."" So I haven't been eating a whole lot.

Every single thing about food matters now. Calories? Make sure it's not high. Fat? Same deal.

596,monorogue,1553695339,b64uut,"First, I want to say I’m diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so I’m seeing my psychiatrist pretty often.
Last August I needed a med adjustment and my doc was shocked with how skinny I was. I weighed 88 pounds. He asked how much I weigh and I lied saying I weigh 99 lbs.
On my last med adjustment I was prescribed Seroquel which is known to cause weight gain.
Last month when I went back I told him I gained weight. He smiled and said “good”.
I gained 11 pounds.
2 days ago I went back to get a prescription and I told him I’m worried about gaining anymore weight.

He sat me down and told me I’m anorexic.
I denied. He then made a deal with me that I’ll get to 105 lbs. I fought with his idea, I told him I’m gonna starve myself and he then told he doesn’t want me to die. And explained what anorexia does to people.
I left his office telling him I accept his deal, but now I’m starving myself.

I know it’s bad, but I just can’t stand the idea that I will gain weight. I liked myself skinny, I do not want to get fat again.
3 years ago I weighed 136 lbs, and I lost 44 pounds just to become skinny. And I loved it, and I stuck to that for 2 years. Counting calories, deny myself food, always worried I’m gaining weight, constantly sitting on the scale to make sure my weight is as low as possible.
I know if I stop taking my antipsychotic my weight will go down. But that will wreck havoc in my life and I’ll probably get hospitalized because of it.

Deep down, I know he’s right.

Is mental recovery even possible? I can’t imagine going a long period of time feeling no fear, no guilt, and no shame regarding eating.

What is it like to go to a restaurant and *not* choose your meal based on the calorie count next to it, while thinking to yourself “If I only eat a few bites, I’ll only have a quarter of these calories.”?

What is it like to grocery shop without an overwhelming guilt of getting food for yourself that you really don’t need?

It must feel amazing to go to any social event and freely grab sweets off the table without the overwhelming embarrassment of even looking at those chocolate chip cookies.

And as much as I love coffee, I’m sick of spending entire days at my SOs house consuming nothing but coffee so that my excuse for not eating is “I’m ok, I’m having coffee right now!”

I can’t imagine ever not having these thoughts linger in my head. I’ve been trying for a while to recover and have been somewhat successful despite my recent relapse. But in the time I spent trying to recover, I still have my AN mindset. I still want to integrate my AN habits with my recovery because I never feel quite ready to give them up.

Looking through all the posts on this page, not one of you deserve to struggle with your ED. Not a single person here or anywhere. It hurt my heart to actually read first-hand accounts from people who feel the same terrible way I do about food, weight, and self image. EDs painfully control our lives and we lose out on so many great experiences and feelings because of them.

But it really hit me in that pain that if you all don’t deserve to struggle with AN, maybe I don’t either. What makes me so special anyways?? I was on the path to recovery once before I relapsed badly. For a while now, I’ve been telling myself I will recover again but didn’t have to willpower to see it through. It’s not easy, but I know it’s gonna be worth it.

615,queenetc,1553482643,b55akd,"sorry this is log !!!

A little backstory to add some knowledge:
I’ve been struggling since I was in grade school. I reread some of my journal from high school, and there was an entry about being 101lbs and having to skip meals and workout. I’ve been called too skinny, but we all know that there is never skinny enough. always want more.

Fast forward a few years to when I went to a residential treatment center in December of 2016 to help with that, among other troubles. I got out and stuck to a meal plan... but it was hard. Especially hard when numerous coworkers commented on how I’ve gained weight.  so I said fuck it, and got right back on the ED train. I started working out frequently and eating basically nothing.

unfortunately, I have chronic health issues, physical, not just mental. I could no longer work out. I had to have another heart surgery. I didn’t cancel my membership because I planned to be right back at it once I got approved for physical activity again.... but they didn’t fix the problem so my hiatus was prolonged yet.

I just want to be fit and skinny.

so I’m back to starving myself. lying about meals. drinking too much water. of course, the obsession is still there. I swear this disorder is your inner demon working it’s hardest to make you hate yourself.

but I’m in a relationship now. &amp; my girlfriend has an eating disorder too. I know they lie about meals and stuff too. if not by saying it, it shows. I am trying to eat... but I hate the feeling that comes with it. I want to starve. I do. I don’t want my thighs to touch. I want the numbers on the scale go down, and do my big smile at the sight.

we agreed to try. so I will try. but...

I know I need to get better, but I don’t know if I want to. I need to give it up, but I don’t know how. even if I did know how, I don’t think I could.

622,Avaloneve,1553413642,b4tulr,"Went to a bar tonight. Was an idiot and drank in the parking lot resulting in the tenders (guess the tenders take smokes out there, too?) giving me a fair warning and generally hating me. Originally they said ""that is public consumption. None of you may enter the bar now."" (I could have gotten arrested for public consumption in the city) but for a while was worried I had ruined by friends birthday party. They almost didn't let the people I was with inside the bar. I even said, ""no please, I'm sorry, I will leave just let them in"" and wanted to cry because all I did was take a sip of booze from my purse.
They took the bottle and asked me how much I had and one said, ""that is impressive"" as they shook it and about 8 shots were gone. And then I heard, ""she's so little!"" As they walked away, allowing me to go in and find my friends after a very thorough ID check and them not believing my age.
Then, I got known as ""r&amp;r girl"" because the DJ who now hates me for drinking in his parking lot took my fifth of cheap whiskey to his car and said I could have it back when I left. (I did get the bottle back but got told, ""yeah take it I don't want that shit"")
This backstory is why every fucking worker in the bar felt they could do what they wanted to me (both nice and mean). I got a glass thrown at me that BROKE and soaked my coat and purse during a bar show. Still not sure what the guy doing the ""show"" meant to me, but made eye contact and he nodded a little. I don't know if it was a ""sorry"" or ""fuck you"". A surprise shattered glass and then the cleanup guy glaring at me filled me with shame. A girl in our group shattered a glass earlier (she dropped it, not a thrown damn glass. I asked. Glass shattering on a person wasn't part of the show) but now there was another broken glass and the guy was like, ""really again?""
Then, the DJ outside asked me if I had eaten. And the man guarding the smoking area. Then my friends husband. And they all wanted me to eat. And I could tell it was because I weigh 95 pounds. (And at that weight I guess it's important I eat before drinking. I did. I ate before the bar) but I felt so small. I had to be cleared to drink even though I'm 25. They made me drink water for an hour first. I get they cared but being so little made feel me a 25 year-old child.

I was treated like a fucking child at a bar. And it doesn't help that I'm short. And I don't know how to feel other than embarrassed.

There weren't many people who took me seriously because I didn't have the body they've been told is the body of anorexia. (I was too big to have a bad relationship with food according to most)

Fast forward to now, and I'm the *heaviest* I've ever been. Doctors are worried. Medicine wont help. 

I started to look towards that horrible dark path again. 

Tonight I was seeing an amazing friend who has been and always will be a savior to me in my eyes

We used to do photoshoots together. 

He causually shows me an old photo. Staring back at me was the face of my past sick self. 

I got emotional for a second because it reminded me just how far I've come. And how I need to stay strong to stay away from going down that path again.

I can’t do this my eating disorder makes me so manipulative and secretive. Normally I tell him literally *everything* but this I just can’t because he will make it stop but not mentally just physically.
But no one will actually help me with it (neither physical or psychological) because even though I am shedding weight I am not underweight so I am being praised, congratulated on how good I look. Little do they know just how Ill I am. 
My kidneys are dying, my heart is getting weaker. But my doctor just thinks it’s past damage and doesn’t care because I’m not “sick enough” to need help I’m not as thin as I used to be. But at this rate I’m not far off it. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore it is all too much. I am so ashamed I let it reach this point but so ashamed by how fat I am and I can’t take it anymore. Maybe I should just kill myself to make it better.

""You're making a mistake"" ""look at what this will do to you"" ""stop!"" ""you're breaking your rules"" ""come back to me, back to happiness""

One of my near friends is struggling with an eating disorder. And I’m trying to help her in whatever way I can, but I don’t know if I’m going about it right.
She has very low self-esteem and wants to become even skinnier than I think would be healthy. She often sends me snaps or the like with pictures of a body part (most often her thighs) and says something like wanting to become skinnier, or how she’s almost close to her goal. I always tell her that I think she looks great right now, and that she looks better than some of the pictures of people with her goal weight do. However, it seems like this annoys or upsets her and I’m starting to doubt if I’m really doing actually is helping or if I’m just making things worse or making her dislike me. Like I said, she has very low self-esteem so that’s why I’m always trying to compliment her or improve her view of herself.

665,Shadowed-Heart,1553917432,b76p8m,"So, for the next week I want to try something new. 

Every 2 days, there will be a different set of 5 riddles. I will post the riddles on a thread like this, and if you think you know the answers you can either start a chat with me or message me privately. Do not post the answers in the comments! Doing so will result in a 12h mute.

**Once a week scribbl.io games.** 

Every Saturday night, unless my plans change, we will do a scribbl.io game. If you don't know what that is: it's a game where a group of people takes turn drawing words and the people not drawing have to guess the word. 

*Tomorrow's scribble game will be at 6pm EST.*

Once or twice a week, I want to do a ""theme"" day. This is just an experiment, but if people like it we'll do more. By themes, I mean ""dog day"", ""cat day"", ""motivation(the good kind) day"" etc... anything lighthearted. You'll post pictures, stories, etc.. 

I will always announce scribbl.io games in the casual convo subreddit chat room, so if you are interested in that I suggest joining that chat room. But for the riddles and theme days, I will probably make an announcement. 

__***The Riddles:***__ 

• Complete this sequence of letters: o, t, t, f, f, s, s, _, _, _. 

• I can be cracked, made, told, and played. What am I? 

• I am a seed with three letters in my name. Take away the last two and I still sound the same. What am I?

• I am the type of room you can not enter or leave. What am I? 

• What goes in the water black and comes out red? 

You have 2 days to answer the riddles(: You can get 3 hints if you send me a chat message/regular message privately. You can't use all the hints on one riddle. ","Let's try something new.

681,meatloafball,1554866266,bbh7zw,"I went to a sushi place with several friends from a previous job. 

I’m particularly comfortable with 1 of them (there were five. O, K, A, J, D) &amp; i’m kinda interested in A. but overall i’m on good terms with everyone.

This past year has been legitimately the best year of my life in terms of mental health (new med). Almost never feeling suicidal, eating more regularly, almost no anxiety. But these past few months everything is returning. 

So whenever i would thjnk about going to dinner i would get anxious &amp; feel nauseous. I though originally it was bc A was going to be there but i kept thinking about what i would eat when i was there. 

I would get so so anxious. I was considering what i wanted to eat &amp; what i thought was ok to eat. On my drive there i hadn’t yet determined what was ok to eat, and was feeling crazy anxious to the point where i thought i should not go. I sat in the parking lot for a few minutes FREAKING OUT. My hands were shaking, i felt nauseous &amp; i still wasn’t sure what was ok to eat.

I was debating leaving but really wanted to see my friends &amp; i was thinking maybe the anxiety would settle down once i actually sat down. 

I was anxious the whole time, tho partially due to sitting across for A (lol), i ordered water and a salmon roll, something which i typically consider to be ok.

(might i mentioned the only thing i had that day was 2 pieces of chex mix to “prepare” myself to eat)

The girls ordered sushi, &amp; the guys got other stuff so our food arrived first.

i was feeling horrifically anxious when my food arrived, i tried picking up my chopsticks but my hands were shaking so bad i had to put them down immediately. i was feeling so sick. 

eventually my friends started pointing out that i wasn’t eating, and i wasn’t prepared with an excuse as to why so i just said i was waiting..???? idk. but over the course of 2 hours i still wasn’t eating &amp; they kept asking &amp; asking if i was ok &amp; even the waitress asked if something was wrong.

i was freaking. the. fuck. out. 

i couldn’t even look at my food, i had to angle my body away. i felt so???? scared?? like the world was narrowing down on my &amp; i felt everyone was staring at me (they weren’t). 

i ended up taking the food home to my sister, and on the drive home i had a full blown panic attack. i couldn’t breathe &amp; was crying &amp; hating myself for being so fucking stupid to not even be able to eat on a DINNER DATE, and while i love my friends i just wish i never went.

3 of my friends texted me if i was ok afterwards (and i feel so stupid for being visibly upset enough for them to notice) but i told A i have anxiety eating around others, and i straight up told O i have an ED.

i feel so fucking stupid. now i can’t ever eat or not eat around them without them noticing.

also, side note: i went to panera with another friend &amp; wanted to look at the pastries because they’re pretty and he stRAIGHT IP FUCKING SAID “you’re so fat haha” when HE FUCKING KNOWS ABOUR MY ED.

too many people are aware of my food issues &amp; i want to die. but yea. i think i’m relapsing.

I've never told him. I also never told him about my struggle with anorexia/bullimia. He just thinks that I try to stay healthy and loose some excess weight. He doesn't know I want to look like those models on tumblr.

701,justasilhouette,1555648139,bev4tq,"I truly hope this isn’t triggering. I just am an emotional wreck tonight and need space to talk it out. 

Overall I feel like I have a solid treatment team who takes me seriously and has told me multiple times how concerned they are. But a few days ago, I ended up in the ER after passing out from critically low blood sugar and breaking my wrist. Most nurses were great, but the doctor was a complete ass (“I need to admit you, but it’s pointless if you’re not going to start making some serious changes”). I consented to admission to get my glucose stable, and it was fine and uneventful but I still was feeling miserably sick. The doctor tonight basically said “cool, your blood sugar is up to 55 now and that seems like your happy place so you’re good to go” which, fine, I have to get back to work anyway. But it felt so invalidating to be like... the second my blood pressure is out of the 70s/80s, or my potassium reaches 3.5.... that I’m “fixed”. 

I struggle a ton with asking for help. I want to be fine and push through and prove that I’m capable of recovering. But I feel so defeated. Like, when I reach out and practically beg for help because I’m scared, I’m told that I’m “fine enough” I guess? I’ve had multiple medical professionals tell me severity of my current situation, but all it takes is one uninformed person to make me feel like shit.  

And now I’m home with a blood sugar probably under 50, knowing I need to eat before bed, and feeling so fucking tired of constantly fighting this fight.

i thought i was getting better and i was starting to be in a really good place. 

recently i've started slipping again. weighing myself more, eating significantly less, tracking anything i eat, doing more exercise to the point where my legs ache every day but i keep doing it. i keep looking in the mirror and only seeing fat. 

fat tummy, fat thighs, fat arms, fat face and just fat everything. i hate it. i need to get rid of it. 

i currently weigh 10 kgs more than i did last year and half of me wants to stay that way but the other half is pushing me to lose weight and stop eating. i used to fast and i've started doing it again.

734,biscoffspread,1555183176,bcu4ev,"ever since i was 14, i restricted my food intake. and i lost xx kg (i don't want to trigger anyone so i'll just x the numbers) within 2 years. when i was 17 (in 2017), i started going to college and i don't know why it just got wayyy worse from then. i restricted myself so much that i only had one slice of bread a day. anything more than that i would break down and cry. i tried to purge anything i overate, but failed then. i had to count every single calorie i would ever eat. i used to spend hours at the supermarket daily just to look at food and the nutrition label but end up not getting anything. i also used to weigh myself on a daily basis and i do some body checks. i brought food to school and gave it to my classmates or the bin and then lie to my family that i already ate. my classmates thought i was really skinny, but i didn't think so, and i still don't. one dude was very straightforward and told me to eat very frequently :/ he even said skinny isnt attractive ://// 

my father forced me to eat because i lost quite a bit of weight and i was severely underweight (i don't feel that i was underweight enough though) . whenever i had food in front of me, i would cry because im really really scared of eating. i was scared of gaining weight after i eat. i didn't have energy and was really tired all the time. i see stars whenever i get up from my chair but never fainted, the worse thing was only me falling down.

later in 2017, i just had this sudden thought that i didn't want to live like this anymore. i don't want to look at food and only wish i could be eating it. i don't want to feel so lethargic all the time. i want to live my life. i want to travel the world. i want to be smart, i know all the restricting made my brain slightly cloudy, i never could concentrate in class no matter how hard i tried. i wanted to go out and eat good food with my friends, i didn't want to block them out anymore. but i didn't really know how to start. i wanted to eat. but i couldn't get myself to,i was too scared. but slowly i started eating more and more, i finally had energy to do things. it was actually so difficult because i didn't know how much a normal person should eat. my stomach shrank so i got full very easily. whenever i ate a ""normal"" meal, my stomach would hurt really really really bad. 

at one point i was actually happy with my body but i was still underweight.

but around 6 months of being that weight, i started binging and i hate myself for it. sometimes i'll purge the food out but i hate doing that. but i can't help it.

now, i binge but i don't really restrict anymore. i also don't really purge, i don't plan to, i only did it 4 times this year. but when i do it i don't really finish purging everything. i can't believe i still ""plan"" to restrict because i hate my body. but i fail to do it, i am quite disappointed in myself. like, i eat so unhealthily nowadays. i can't believe i used to only eat a slice of bread but yet now i am binging, this is literally my worst nightmare. i was so afraid i would binge. so... thats now i guess... im around borderline acceptable weight for my height, according to the bmi chart. but i look so fat. i don't look like my weight. 

i still hate my body but I've progressed, i used to hate it so much that i can't even do normal daily activities without crying and feeling sad. i skipped a lot of school because i didnt dare to show my fat self at school :/ i couldnt concentrate on my studies as well because i felt so huge....... but now at least i can still go outside and talk to my friends. 

sorry if this is all over the place, but i just wanna know if i was ever considered anorexic or am i just overthinking it? can i say that i am currently in recovery? or was i never anorexic in the first place?",was i anorexic or did i just have bad eating habits?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bcu4ev/was_i_anorexic_or_did_i_just_have_bad_eating/,1555204776.0,2019-04-13 14:19:36

This made me incredibly self conscious about numbers (I already thought I was fat) and now I’m on medication where side effects of one is increased appetite. 

Because of this I have consciously made the choice to not eat even when I am hungry. Sometimes I go days with only eating 1-2 small meals. 

But I haven’t been diagnosed. And I don’t think I have full blown anorexia. I am definitely not struggling as much as some of you. 

My family, especially my sister, has noticed my weight loss and says I look significantly thinner. Though I still see myself as fat in the stomach. 

She told my mom I wasn’t eating and my mom threatened to send me to an in patient care. 

While I find that idea entertaining simply because I want to get over this, I don’t think I would “qualify” I feel like I wouldn’t belong there since my problem is not as bad.

I've lost 40 pounds since September, so I went from 220 to 180, and I'm 5'4"".

But if I still eat 750 calories a day, do I really have an eating disorder? I don't really feel like I would want to stop this anytime soon since I honestly still want to lose another 40. And since I'm still huge, I feel like it can't be that bad? I guess I just wanted to see what people think.

And although i understand they wanted to do this so i would gain some weight... it didn't really help me mentally. Each appointment i would come in, they feed me 2 packs of oreos and make me drink 2 ensures. They would measure my vitals and if I didn't gain enough weight they would scold me,tell me would i rather die than eat?

The sessions were 30 mins long and she would just ask me about my boyfriend (at the time, now husband) and how's he been and what vacations are coming up, blah.

Will this do anything to combat the hair loss she is experiencing? She caught it “early” but I fear the damage may be done. She still has a full head of hair, this is not full on balding as one sees in more chronic cases of this horrible disease.

797,ColaQueen15,1557301486,bm2etk,"Hey everyone, I’m new to this corner of the ED internet, but I’ve been on ED tumblr/Insta/Twitter for years, and something I feel like no one really talks about is abusing drugs to kill your appetite so you’re not hungry. People talk about lax, weight loss pills, etc. a lot, but I don’t think I’ve ever run into anyone else who  (admittedly and consistently) takes stimulants to suppress appetite, increase energy, and help with the “brain fog” that so often comes with low restriction. I guess I just want to know if there’s anyone else out there who does this too? I’ve been taking Adderall for the better part of two years now off and on, but recently got a prescription after a computerized test to confirm that I do indeed have adult ADHD. Adderall started as something to help me pull all nighters and stay sharp during finals week, then slowly progressed to whenever I had a big test, and now it’s every day, because it really does help me focus and complete tasks. But I still take a higher dose than what I’m prescribed, and I usually just don’t eat when I take it because the thought of food disgusts me. I’ve been justifying it to myself thus far because it helps with school, and my anxiety and grades have both markedly improved, but I’ve lost quite a bit of weight in a short amount of time. I’m finally starting to let myself admit that the abuse, not the use, is probably down to my ED. I also went on a cocaine bender last year for about 6 months in combination with the Adderall, but I cut it off once it started to become problematic. And it SUCKED, because I gained a bunch of weight back once I started eating relatively normally again. I think part of the appeal also has to do with the control aspect of the disease, because I definitely feel more in control of myself, my life, and my own brain when I’m on stimulants, and that’s really hard for me to give up. I’ve been a lot better lately thanks to a new psychiatrist, new antidepressants (that actually work!), new anxiety medication, and weirdly enough because I did get a legitimate prescription for Adderall and now have to make sure it lasts the whole month instead of just buying more. Has anyone else done this, or is anyone else prescribed Adderall, and how do you keep yourself balanced and in a better mindset? I don’t want to lose the progress I’ve made, but it’s officially finals season and the stress is making me want to abuse it again so I don’t eat, which I know is actually detrimental to my health and my grades. Any tips, advice, or just commiserations appreciated!

798,brandonj1747,1557298668,bm22ip,"My amazing girlfriend and I have been together for almost 6 months. I love her so much, but I don’t love her eating disorder. It is a very sensitive topic in our relationship and it basically boils down to my girlfriend absolutely refusing to get any sort of help or talk to anyone about it. She sees a counselor for PTSD and depression, but she never mentions the eating disorder. I see how it clouds her judgement, and she even admitted to me that she isn’t ready to get better yet. How could someone not want to get better? Watching her struggle is the most heartbreaking scene, and any advice I offer is immediately shut down and dismissed, because she’s “been dealing with it longer than I have.” She always tells me that her recovery has to be on her time, not mine. But how can I trust her to actually seek recovery in the future if she is so adamantly in favor of waiting. Can’t she see how badly it hurts me? I want nothing more than for her to be happy and healthy, and I have a lot of trouble knowing how to react or respond. We recently had an argument where we agreed to not mention the ED at all because she refuses to seek help and I have done nothing but stress and strain myself trying to offer advice and help only to be met with being completely shut down. Eventually we will live together, and I feel that I may have to closely monitor what she eats. She tells me that I can’t control her, but I feel like that is the mental illness speaking through her. It doesn’t want to be contained, and she’s getting very resistant and easily agitated when we discuss ED related matters. I am very depressed and insecure and I will be undergoing therapy very soon for my mental health issues, and sometimes I feel like I can not handle both of our issues at once. I am constantly pushed a huge plate of complaints from her every day and I feel like I spend more time trying to comfort her because she’s sick than doing anything else. The other night we had a talk about my growing suicide thoughts, and she didn’t do a very good job of being sympathetic or even really listening. But I’m expected to sit and let my girlfriend tell me that it’s okay for her to lose X pounds because it would put her right at the margin for healthy and underweight, or that she’s going to make a cleansing detox drink that will make her throw up and help her lose weight; but I have to very very carefully watch my words because anything I say can make her break into a fit of tears because I said the wrong thing. I just don’t know how to handle her horrendous illness in addition to my own personal struggles. I love her more than anything, but I feel like I may not be able to handle it all much longer. I want to be happy with her, and I truly believe that it is out there for us one day, but I honestly feel that she is holding herself back and making things harder on herself. She tells me not to get so effected by her struggles, but that is a ridiculous thing to request of a very passionate and loving boyfriend. 

Any advice? Criticism? I would love to hear back on what I can expect to see when she is serious about recovery.

I promise there’s a happy ending.

I was in a pretty bad abusive relationship, being physically abused and then told by both him and everyone around me that I should be thankful a guy was even putting up with me. 

First I ate salads and he praised me. I ate less and less and was praised for how much better and “healthier” I looked. I caved one night, Mac and cheese, my all time favorite. I was so hungry, so stressed, so starved for anything to make me feel happy I got up for a second portion at the college cafeteria. “Um, eat much?” He said. 

That was all it took. The delusion was confirmed. What I was eating was being monitored and this was a disgusting indulgence. 

I know it’s silly but for a desire to not trigger others you’ll have to trust me that the abuse went deeper. For example, he used to trace the outline of my belly and remark how strange it was that with all my extra weight none of it ever went to my chest, just my thighs. 

I barely ate anything for a year. I have no idea how much weight I lost but it was a contest with myself. It was a way to get praise when every day he told me how unlovable and monstrous I was. 

I got out of that “relationship”. I made new friends who helped me recognize the damage and rebuild the beautiful self I had before he came along. With time, help, honesty and openness about my struggles I am so pleased to report I have eaten two helpings of Mac and cheese guilt free! I still struggle with equating food and praise and my road is not fully traveled but I’m working hard and I wish you all the best in some day getting your second helping of Mac and cheese too! ;)",This month celebrates 3years eating food I love with people who care about me!,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/blmgud/this_month_celebrates_3years_eating_food_i_love/,1557225845.0,2019-05-06 23:44:05
803,madi808,1557201366,blm1sm,"At the beginning of this year, I was formally diagnosed with anorexia, restrictive type. Although I had been struggling with the disorder for a lot of my life. A year and a half ago, after my freshman year of college, I gained 30 pounds which pushed me over the edge to say the least. I started working out and eating better, but then it turned more into an obsession and I had categorized food as good or bad. Now things are to the point where people are worried about me because of all the weight I’ve lost. I’m at my lowest weight ever! For those who are curious, I’m 5’11” and 135lbs. I feel so tired all the time. Not just because of my lack of nutrition, but also because of the constant battle in my head against Ana. Every single time I’m hungry or it’s meal time, it’s a battle. Should I eat or not? Do I really need food or can I wait longer? When I do eat I typically feel like I’ve failed or betrayed the other voice in my head. This increases my anxiety and feelings of guilt. I also bruise soooo easily. Seems like every time I bump into something I create a new bruise. I just don’t know what to do anymore. Everything feels like a crazy mess in my head. And sometimes when people ask me questions idk the answers. I mean how am I suppose to explain something to you if I don’t even know/understand myself.

I’ve never been inpatient before and the thought of having less control in an unfamiliar environment terrifies me. Idk what to do or what to think.

I was recovered, but I’ve relapsed harder than I have ever relapsed before. I reach out to people too, i talk to them and they tell me to go see a specialist. I want to. I’m 10 pounds underweight and I can tell I’m lacking so many vitamins . 

At the beginning, I was telling myself that I would get help if this was still happening in a week. Then when I reached out to the counseling center, and to the dietitian at my school, I avoided their emails and phone calls when they answered back. I found out there’s support groups and I told myself I needed to go, for my own good. But later would make an excuse and to this day haven’t shown up to one. The worst part is that even though I weigh myself and I know I’m underweight and not okay, I still look in the mirror and see flaws.

811,magnificentgoddess,1557017561,bkryu3,"Hello, I just discovered this sub, and I have been engaging in restrictive eating for a couple of weeks, during which I learned a lot about my relationship with food. I have never had any problems with food in the past (besides the normal fluctuations of occasional overeating or undereating). When I started feeling pleased with myself when I had broken my fasting record and later developed a habit of feeling guilty after eating, I went to see a counselor. She didn't seem too worried when I explained my concerns, but she did schedule another appointment with me, which is coming up in a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of days later (Thursday), I was feeling confident in my ability to eat a normal amount based on my counselor's reaction, but after eating slightly more (\~1500cal) than my BMR (\~1400cal). I felt horrible about eating so much the previous day on Friday, so I did a low-calorie fast of \~200cal. Today, I ate \~500cal and felt like I had overeaten a bit. No guilt today, though, so I'm planning to maintain that amount until I speak to my counselor again. (Before appt, I had been eating \~1000cal/day.)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a slightly elevated BMI, and I keep saying to myself that I'm going to eat enough to maintain my weight after I lose enough lbs to have a normal BMI.

This is a weird post to make 'cause I've talked to no one but my s/o and psychiatrist about this, but with their help (and honestly, from push of people from r/loseit, I've come to terms I had some sort of eating disorder (between bulimia and anorexia) for a few years.

I'm quite short, 160cm/5'2 and used to weight 82kg/180lbs, and decided it'd be time to lose weight since I was quite obese with a bmi of 32. I'm the type of person who can't do anything if I don't do it ""well enough"" or ""perfectly"", so I decided I'd change my diet completely to eat nothing but meat, fruit and veggies. I kept losing weight rapidly, and I was so happy. This kept going and I eat less and less constantly, starting to show signs of bulimia, eating at the evening and throwing everything out, 'cause ""why would I need energy, I'm just going to bed, I shouldn't have eaten it anyway"". Sometimes this happened multiple times a day, maybe 3-5 times a week. I didn't allow food for myself.

My goal was to reach 60kg/132lbs and after a while I did it. I then had a little break from the constant dieting, but couldn't stay away when I realized I'm gaining water weight from the carbs I was starting to eat again. I thought I was gaining fat, I was becoming fat again, undoing all my hard work. I had to start the diet again, and I had to do it better. I didn't know what water weight was or how people gained it. I still don't know all the facts.

I started the diet again, no more carbs, just meat and veggies. And I started going to the gym. This lasted for a few months and I'll be real, most of it is a blur. I remember it was controlling my life, I didn't go out with anyone 'cause they would have wanted to eat something unhealthy, I didn't eat at school or work 'cause I had no idea what were in those foods and I wore baggy clothes 'cause I felt so disgusting. It got to the point where I ate 100-200 calories a day, usually one yogurt, and I made a post on the r/loseit subreddit asking helping 'cause I stopped losing weight and my digestion was slowing down to a critical point. They scared me to go look for professional help, since my problem was very serious. I didn't see it then.

So I talked to people about it, people I trusted. My s/o and psychiatrist. They both told me I need to start eating more, so I slowly started increasing the calories I eat daily, by 100 a week. I'm at 1000-1100 calories a day right now, and while it's still slow, I feel way stronger and in control. I've spent nights educating myself on water weight specially, trying to understand it and to tell myself it's not fat that is in my body, it's my body storing water for various reasons.

I'd eat more but I'm terrified of certain food still, and it's really hard. It's mostly carbs. I eat brown rice as my source of most carbs, but cannot for the life of me get back to bread or pasta. I'm afraid I'd fall back to throwing up again. I also keep a food diary/food planner where I count the calories, just to make sure I eat enough. I've been stuck to this calorie amount for a while and I cannot think how to go forward. Currently, my days always have a meal with veggies, rice and meat, and as snacks every 2ish hours I eat watermelon, cereal, yogurt, carrots and eggs.

I think I started writing this post to share my experiences from the past few years with you guys, but also to ask something. If I were to increase my calories, while eating healthy food, what'd you do? To me, it has to be healthy or I'm afraid of the symptoms showing themselves again. I just... need help.

I've come far in a short amount of time with this, but my recovery is still underway.

824,meancigarette,1557949220,bp2gbw,"There is a lot to say about my own journey in Anorexia. A body dysmorphia that I obtained since childhood involved into an eating disorder around my teenage years. 


Tried many things; fasting for days in row, walking miles and miles under the hot dessert summer, freezing cold showers, thousands of crunches a day, drinking low cal tea until I pass out. 


Done many things and been to many places. There were days I would avoid mirrors and times I didn’t go shopping because I knew changing rooms are meant for mental breakdowns. 

6 years down the road, was only happy in my own skin when I loved and been loved for the first time. And when he was away I fell back into it. I fell back deep.

Nowadays, i’m lost in the cycle of relapse and recovery. Counting my days on packs of cigarettes and there is days that only thing I consume is alcohol. My body is not a temple. It’s dying with every hour. I don’t like what I see in the mirror and I don’t like anything. Binging and regretting and crying. that’s the new cycle I kinda obtained.

I’m now entering a very stressful 2 weeks in university. Everything is much harder when you do it with constant body dysmorphia thoughts in your head, a hungry stomach and headache caused by too much smoking. 


I’m tired knowing that I will never be enough for anything. I’m tired that my boyfriend has to love me like this and I can never be better for him. I’m tired and tired about thinking everything that involves my image. I wanna wear a skirt even though it makes me look absolutely huge. And I also wanna eat a fucking pizza before thinking how much calories in it.

I’m tired and in the middle of a mental breakdown.

826,noaggets,1557925334,boxnyx,"Hello. I'm 17 and so is my classmate. She's been suffering from anorexia for very long. She was studying ballet dancing, but she had to stop because of her health. She is very passionate about it and has amazing balance. She's an incredible student, never seen anyone like her. She's also very thin. She is often cold and she declines invites to hang out with the rest of the class most times. She was hospitalized once, but she was very scared of staying there alone, so her mother took her home. She goes to the doctors and she needed to be hospitalized around Christmas, but her mother let her stay home. She has also gone to psychologists, but she's very shy and closed in herself as a person and she wouldn't talk to the psychologist. I understand her on this because I'm the same and when I was sent to therapy for depression I couldn't manage to even open my mouth.

Some long time friends of her are two of our classmates. One of them confronted her once because she used to hide the food she was given to eat in her pokets, now she no longer brings food at school. She cried and begged her friend to not tell her mother. The thought of going back to the hospital must be truly horrible for her. I wonder, what are some of your experiences about being in a hospital?

I don't really know how I can help her. We are not that close even. But we talk a lot lately, though of nothing which matters, just school and superficial stuff. Today I've almost opened up to a friend of mine about my depression and I suddenly thought that, when I was deep into suicidal thoughts, having someone else opening up about depression would have helped me greatly. Though I have no idea what to do with this thought.

So, I'm asking you... What's something that someone did/said to you that made you feel a bit better?

I didn't really expect much at first, thought maybe a few people would answer at most. I probably wouldn't be writing this if I didn't get the response that I did.


 I watched as they came through, and I never expected such a response. I read through every story and every hardship you listed. The points you guys gave me spurred deeper research rather than if I had not done the survey at all, and honestly I was shocked. After reading through everything and organizing it all, I have to say:

The survey was for a school project, which I will be presenting within the next week. Someone said in the anything box that they hoped I would share my project with the subreddit. I would share my resources for this presentation with you guys but I don't want to breach confidentiality of anyone who participated as well as I don't want to be potentially identified if someone in my class is participating on this subreddit. if this was a personal project I probably would share it.

855,lyndsybunny,1558555248,brtfpi,"I have struggled with eating since I was 15. I used to have a good friend in high school who was my “Ana buddy,” and we would skip lunch together &amp; eat safe foods together. We both had private Instagram &amp; myfitnesspal accounts logging out calories, workouts, and depressive episodes, as well as posting lots of thinspo. 

I started cutting when I was 16 and ruined my thighs in that process. This was the point in my life where I started overeating and purging as well. 
I would fast at school all day long, only drinking water and maybe a Diet Coke. I’d come home and eat everything in my cabinet. Bowls upon bowls of cereal. Whole boxes of crackers. Cartons of ice cream. 
I stopped doing these things around high school graduation. I had new friends, I was smoking more weed, and got a wonderful boyfriend, who I’m still with today. 

I’m 19 now, turning 20 next month. I have never been diagnosed with any disorders or anything, although I have been going through this for years. My weight has fluctuated around 60 pounds since high school, and nobody seems to notice the fact that I’ve been overweight as well as underweight. (I am 5’9” and right now I weigh 125 lbs. 

Lately, shit has been hitting the fan. 

My dad lost his leg in a motorcycle accident and died in October this year. 

The friend I had in high school (my Ana buddy) was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma in January. She still struggles with disordered eating and is going through chemotherapy. I pray for her well-being every day, and I still see her from time to time. 

My aunt (my dad’s brother’s wife) just died last week. Due to a blood clot that caused an aneurysm. As I type this I am in a hotel room with my family in LA. They are getting ready for her service. 

I haven’t eaten since lunch yesterday. I’m starting to think that I’m becoming depressed again, just not logging down my every emotion and thought, so I think I’m not as conscious of my sadness. I’m probably not gonna eat the rest of the day.

I always want to lose weight, but i dont have the self control to stop myself from eating. 

The reason i said this would make people mad, is because, in short, i admire people with anorexia, and i know its wrong, but all my mind can think is “wow look at how much better they look than you, why cant you be like that, why dont you have the self control that they have?”

Ive read the stories of people’s personal experiences with anorexia, the ones that are meant to scare you off and make you say “oh my god thats terrible” but all they seem to do is inspire me. 

I know its wrong, but i cant stop myself from thinking this way, and ive been attempting to eat less unsuccessfully and everytime i fail i am ashamed and disgusted. The only reason i havent resorted to bulimia yet is because i saw some photos of the teeth of people that have it when i was younger, and decided against it.

My cousin who I grew up with knows, my sister knows cause she is a physiologist, and my boyfriend idk if he gets it or not.

This is the longest episode I've had. I'm scared, because I trained myself not to have an addictive personality. (Addiction is common in my genetics)

I wanted to ask for help from my boyfriend tonight. I wanted to tell him I'm not eating, and if I do I usually throw it up. That I lie about eating lunch or breakfast or the reason why I dont eat supper with him usually isnt because I had such a late lunch. I started off with saying that I am worried about gaining weight.

I just about broke down infront of him and I'm trying not to break down now writing this. I've done so much for my stomach to be flat and I feel like I failed. It turned into him getting quiet and then when I asked what was wrong he said a few things (not related to this page) and then said something about my body dysmorphia.

So I've been recovering from my eating disorders for about nine months and it's been going very well until a few weeks ago.
I met my current partner a year ago and he is an amazing cook. He helped me so much with my anxiety around food and I got so much better. He helped me change my eating habits completely so that I eat and don't gain. And I started training with him this winter. I've been steadily losing fat and gaining muscles which have been a bit triggering since I've stayed at the same weight for months. But when I measure my body I've become so much slimmer. We also recently started running together and I love it but it's been awful weather this last week and we've had to stay in. Ever since we started running I've been so aware of my body and it's made things hard again. It's mostly okay when he's home because I have no choice but to eat so he won't get worried. but today he's at work and I had my first binge/purge relapse I'm months. Normally I just don't eat when he's not at home but today I decided to make him proud and eat, but instead I fucked it all up and now I have blood freckles on my cheeks from throwing up so hard.
I feel ashamed. And angry at myself. But at the same time I feel so good now that my stomach is completely empty. I haven't felt this in so long and I'm scared that I'll get worse again. We live together now so throwing up regularly won't happen but I really miss feeling this empty and I can't stop thinking about restricting and how I can do it without him noticing. I want to lose more weight. It really triggers me to see the same numbers every week. Even if I know I'm getting thinner it's just not enough.

As you can imagine I put on a substantial amount of weight while I was pregnant with my son who was born last month, I felt terrible regarding my body image but I had to to what I had to do, I intended to breastfeed which would require me to keep up a substantial diet, but it turns out I couldn’t.. ever since I’ve had to bottle feed him my first thought was “I can eat how I like now” and I’ve been restricting again ever since. 
I feel so stupid and selfish but it’s like I can’t help myself, I adore my son but I feel like the pregnancy weight has made me feel the lowest I’ve ever felt with my confidence. 

It seems really messed up but I’m not fully fasting because I’m scared of fainting while I’m looking after him, but I’m restricting just enough to function.

888,Inf3rnus16,1559089766,bu7v57,"So my whole life I’ve been slim. Not super skinny but not average. I didn’t notice how skinny I was until I took a video of myself just to see how big I was since a few people commented how skinny I was. It lowered my self esteem. In the mirror I think I look okay. In the mirror I am so happy with how I look and I don’t look skinny in the mirror but in a video or a picture I look very skinny. 

I think I also have lumbar lordosis and a bit of a slouch but hurts to stand normally. I should also add that I am 5’10” and 130lbs. My weight kinda fluctuates because i get diarrhea often and doctors say it’s not IBS but my mom has that. Every doctor says I’m just skinny. I’ve had blood tests and all of that.

I am very self conscious with my appearance and that leads to anxiety and not wanting to go to school or out because of how I look. So many people stare and comment on how skinny I am. I had a big growth spurt from 5’2” to 5’7” then slowly to 5’10”. This is when people commented on how skinny I am and when I noticed it. 

My back has an inward curve and I have a slouch that is painful to correct. (Not painful when slouching). My ribs really protrude and I have little chest muscle. My collarbone is also very visible. This really affects me and makes me feel depressed. I want to gain weight and eat the normal 3 meals a day with about 2-3 snacks in between. All I’ve noticed in my weight gain is in my face and a little in my stomach. I’ve tried working out but just lose weight or see little progress. I would go to a chiropractor but my parents can’t afford it.

916,Billmax123,1558792204,bsupdt,"Hi guys

It's Marco here. I am Writing to you because I lost the greatest love of my life. 

I am a Runner，

Running was my everything. It defined the being of who I was，
It was the greatest love of my life. And I just lost It to a stress fracture. 

How I hate life. I Cannot put into words How I miss Running. Nothing can fill the void，
the void of How Running makes me feel. 

Nothing will ever give me that feeling. I want revenge to my body，
I want to destroy it because of what it took away from me.

I have lost about 10 kg. during Marathon training. Because I never replaced the energy I burned. The voice in my head to lose weight was too strong.. To the detriment of my training... i lost too much weight became weaker and suffered injury.

I feel guilty every time I eat，while everytime I step on the scale... The number makes me feel accomplished.

Until the time I was Running，the only reason I ate is because of Running. 
But now running will not protect me from my mind. I Cannot have that. 

I dont See the point of eating，
why would I torture myself with Food . I hate it.

My coach said I am unattractive，he said I am too underweight and I need to gain weight through food and strength training. 

At a very high weight of 49 kg this week. My BMI is 17.8. I have just been on a weight gain diet，from 48 I got to 49 kg in a week. 
How guilty i felt. I only did it because my coach promised i will get back to Running one day. 
I know I will probably never come back to Running. 

I think i will just give in to the voice inside my head that tells me not to eat.
I loved those days when I only ate fruits，water and litres of coffee. I had control. 

The last time I was forced to eat white sugar I almost vomited. How I hate the taste of sweets... I cannot remember the last time I had the desire to eat this kind of food most people seem to adore. It disgusts me.

My coach talked me for hours. 
But the voice inside my head is too strong. There is this one lady at the gym，
she does not exercise when I am there，
because she knows I cannot run and will feel very bad to see her running. Then she comes to me and asks me if i like to eat. I said，I like to eat fruits. 
She is skinny like me. I cannot understand why she judges me.
I dont know but from her eyes I think she had a judjement. She said I cannot exercise，
I am addicted to exercise. 

Today i did one legged cycling，I have to exercise.

my coach put me on a high calorie and protein diet. I felt miserable every time of my life. I did it because I was promised running.
He said I have to eat meat at every meal，fish，12 egg whites a day. 

But I cannot have running. This is the time I will give in into my mind. There is no reason for me to eat if i cannot run. I can have the last enjoyment which is to lose weight and disappear. 

I know I have to gain weight. And i am certainly not starving myself on my doctors orders and on my coachs promises.

But i just cant help that voice inside me.
When I look myself into the mirror，I can see my bloated stomach from every single thing i eat. The number on the scale doesnt matter if i look fat.

on those days where i cheat my high calorie diet and dont eat anything but fruits.. i just feel good. 
Why cant i have that everyday.

I am sick of sitting on the couch. And i am sick of food on my stomach.

Can you tell me. I want to buy laxatives and diuretics to reduce my stomach bloating. Do you have any tips for me.",I want to disappear,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/bsupdt/i_want_to_disappear/,1558813804.0,2019-05-25 08:50:04

924,JasonLionHeart,1559842371,bxjhq6,"So my best friend of several years (we are internet friends but have met IRL) went into an anorexia rehab in January, it’s now June 6th and he DMd me from the rehab facility. His therapist agreed to let him message me once.

To summarise, He basically said that his recovery could take years and that it would be damaging to my mental health to keep “waiting” for him with uncertainty. I told him over and over that I haven’t really been worrying about him or waiting for him a ton because I just want him to take as long as he needs and I don’t mind if it’s years. He spoke about how part of his treatment is not using the internet which would result in us not talking for a long time. I told him I was fine with that. But he essentially wanted us to “part ways” because his mental instability would damage our friendship and he also said he may never recover enough to be able to use the internet again ever. I suggested many things like talking to his parents on Facebook or talking through letters, but the rehab facility wouldn’t allow either. 

I feel so selfish, but this absolutely broke my heart. I absolutely understand that recovery can take years but I just feel kinda thrown away. I feel sad and I don’t know how to get over it. He’s my best friend and I love nobody more than him, he’s really the only person I have in my life. Being autistic it’s been insanely difficult to make friends and I’ve never gotten as close to someone as I have with him before. We promised to travel Asia together, to watch Eachother grow......and he also promised me he’d come back and I promised to wait as long as I needed to see a happier him.

He did tell me that if he did recover enough to use the internet again he’d get back in contact with me. But I’m just afraid incase that day never comes. He worded it as if it wouldn’t.

I’m just very lost. I feel selfish for worrying about my own feelings but it feels like a huge part of my life was just tore from me and I actually can’t deal with it.

Hello everyone, I have been lurking in here for a while. After a reeeaally long battle against obesity (SW: 120 kgs), I managed to get to a healthy weight (I am around 55 kgs, my height is 165 cms)... By restricting and restricting.


Since I have been suffering with health issues (both physical and mental) and had some form of ED when I was in middle school, the doctors who follow my case noticed my eating behavior was bad (and I lost a lot of weight in a really short time, about 1 year), I was sent to an ED clinic and got diagnosed with Atypical Anorexia (I might argue that I am a ""fake"", but the doctors argue that ""they caught me before my conditions got critical"", as I am experiencing several health complications).


I have been taking several tests for a few weeks, mostly focusing on trauma and dysfunctional relationships (family, school, abusive ex...). I didn't really think about it so much at first, but recently I have been having recurring intrusive and horrible thoughts about them, and they are really triggering (as in ""people are better off without me"", if you catch my drift). I called my GP and asked her if I could get the next appointment with the clinic scheduled earlier, because they are becoming quite nasty. 


Has it ever happened to you? How did/do you distract yourself? Do these kinds of tests really mess with your memories that much?

932,ma15-,1559662276,bwq1vj,"Hello, if you took the time to read this thank you :) tldr at bottom 

I’ve never opened up to people about my eating habits but it’s getting to a point where everyday is just a struggle that I don’t want to go through. A year ago, I weighed 48kg and was obsessed with how many calories I consumed and how much I burned through exercise. I would exercise for hours in my room when everyone was asleep, spend all day sleeping and restricted my calories to a point where 400 calories per day felt like a generous amount. This continued on for many months until I stopped restricting and did the opposite. I started eating constantly whenever I felt sad, happy and just plain bored. 

I began sneaking food into my room late at night when everyone had gone to sleep and woke up early in the morning to eat a big breakfast. I eat every meal in my room and don’t eat at school because I’m afraid people will judge me and my weight. I hit my highest weight at 65kg which just made me feel even more disgusted with myself and ended with me eating even more. All of this made me feel bad about myself and I couldn’t understand why I couldn’t stop. I began taking laxatives but stopped after awhile because I went on birth control and did not want it to interfere. 

Now, I’m finding myself going back into my old ways. I’ve began counting my calories again and weigh myself at least 8 times a day to check my progress. I drink litres of water a day just to see the numbers go down on the scale once I have passed the water weight but I’m still tempted by the urge to eat whatever I can get my hands on. I want nothing more but to lose weight and i’m currently down to 54 kg but it’s not enough. I loved how I looked when I was 48kg and I wish I had kept going but every time I try to lose weight I just end up over eating which makes me feel worse about myself. (As a younger child, I was very overweight and only lost the weight once I began restricting). 

What i’m asking is, are these behaviours relatively normal or how can I bring it to attention that I need help with this? I want nothing more than to be back at 48kg and restrict myself further but I don’t think that’s what is healthy and I just want to be happy and at a normal weight. I don’t know how to control myself and stop myself from either eating too much or eating too little. I don’t even know what is in between and healthy but all my parents have ever said is ‘are you losing weight’ which is viewed more as a positive thing not a negative. This makes me think that when I was at my lower weight, it was considered normal and I feel like I can’t reach out. 

TLDR; Lost a lot of weight when I used to restrict food intake and count calories but gained a lot of weight back and began eating excessively.

I simply cannot see any ‘progress’ and think I need to go even lower, like 80lbs small. I know this is not reasonable, but it seems like that’s the only way I’ll see myself as thin. The reason I don’t know if I have a problem is because I am not particularly restrictive nor addicted to exercise — yet the desire to lose weight so I can see progress.

It took a lot of time, therapy and acceptance for me to be where I am now but I guess I am better now. Looking back at my ED at its worst I kinda wish someone would have reached out to me and told me it will get better and that my self worth is not dependent on my weight. 
So I saw this girl in the train, looking frail and shaking. I freed up my seat for her and she thankfully accepted my offer. Of course I could not be certain but she did not look good. She was basically just skin and bones just like I used to be. I thought to myself on whether I should just tap her in the shoulder and tell her that I’ve been trough the same and that it will get better. But I didn’t want to weird her out or make false accusations and offend her. 
I had an entire internal struggle with myself on whether it would be crossing boundaries to talk to her about EDs. I always keep the business card of my psychiatric in the back of my phone case just in case i get an anxiety attack or need to change my appointments. She has helped me cope a lot and actually get better. As she was getting out, I gave her the card and just said “in case you want to talk to someone” she took it and smiled. There was no sign of taking offense or anger. I’m not a mind reader but hence I’ve been trough the same and wanted someone to reach out and care I could imagine what it felt like. This small act of showing concern from a stranger might have meant something to her. Maybe she was weirded out and I just didn’t get it. Everyone has their own ways of coping after all.

Me: and why are you doing that

Me: how long have you been doing this for

Me and another friend who both did research on  anorexia were really worried about her, but our school is messed up.

What should we do? We have a mentality unhealthy teenager who hates herself, thinks she’s fat when she’s really skinny, barely eats anything and hasn’t since December, her parents don’t know, and our school system sucks

I used to be chubby as a kid and have a memory of my mother and grandma pointing it out to me even though they deny it. Around 13 years old I started to skip lunches and not eat as much. I did this with a friend and once I reached my goal weight I wanted to continue but my friend stopped me.

I relapsed during my second year of high school, I was at my lowest weight and everyone around me started noticing. I also started dating my ex and for the first time really talked to someone about this. He since started to force me to eat and I was honestly kinda satisfied with the way I looked because I felt like someone loved me.

That all changed when we broke up. Since the break up I have times of over eating and hating myself afterwards and times of not eating. My confidence is really low right now. On one hand I feel so fat and on the other I feel really thin. I don't know how to explain it. It's like I'm embarassed because I feel like I am fat but when someone touches me and they touch my bone I'm embarassed as well.

The point of this is.. I don't really know if I'm anorexic or if this is just a result of low self esteem. I know this is not a normal behaviour but at the same time I don't feel extremely unhealthy.

I gained over 40 pounds during the period of me taking my antidepressants and the comments people close to me kept making about gaining weight have stuck with me even after i was supposedly ""better"".

I have been dealing with a lot of stress (new city, university, my boyfriend of 3 years literally breaking up with me with the ""how can i love someone who doesn't love themselves"", dad dropping the bomb to me that he might have cancer) and i slipped back to my old ways of avoiding food until im literally too weak to walk basically and ive lost a lot of weight in the past 3 months.

Now usually the people surrounding another person who has rapidly lost weight start to feel concerned, right? Well not in my case.

You see the moment an overweight girl loses weight even if its too fast for it to be healthy all she gets are compliments...

Seeing how no one seemingly cares about me losing weight rapidly all I'm compelled to do is to basically raise the stakes and start eating even less because all of this praise is what ive always wanted, all these years of being made fun of for not being skinny like everyone else around me have seeped so deep into my mind that i cant stop myself even though i know its wrong.

I'm just so upset with the fact that in my country unless youre visibly skinny you cant be anorexic. Because deep down i want to be healthy but this whole situation makes me feel as if all my worth here is calculated based on how skinny i am.

I used to be severely anorexic. I weighed 98 pounds when my healthy weight is 140. Recently, I’ve really wanted 11 line abs. I’ve worked out a lot to get them. I’ve had intense hatred for myself for all of my life, and when I look in the mirror I feel depressed. I only just realized today that I’m acting like I used to. I didn’t care because I wasn’t obsessed with food, but recently I am. I’m starving and exercising a ton and burning anything I do eat, and I freak out if I gain even a fraction of a pound and feel disappointment if I eat. 

I feel so useless. It started with me really wanting to be like two figures, one being a kpop idol and the other just being an extremely skinny but extremely toned person. I never even realized they weren’t very healthy looking until now. I’m not too concerned because I’m so determined to get toned and for that I want to lose weight, but my behaviors have been increasingly worse when food is involved. I’m scared to eat. I become obsessed with looking at the scale if I do. 

I don’t want to starve. I don’t want to be anorexic again, but I want to be skinny. I want to be my idea of perfect. Made up entirely of straight lines and abs. Everybody says I’m too skinny, but I never see it. I feel so depressed looking at myself. When I’m on my side and my thighs touch if my legs are against each other I feel so disappointed. 

I guess I relapsed. I’m going to try to eat at least once every two days though, some fruit or rice or oats. But it’s so weird. It’s different from last time somehow. I’m nervous because it was so crippling last time.. today was the first time (I’ve only been strict about exercise for 13 days because my family ridiculed me for being fat) I panicked and counted calories, and then reduced severely.

At first I thought it wasn’t real because it was on and off constantly, but then I was diagnosed with DID, which makes a lot of sense because only one of my alters suffers from the disorder.

She’s tried to recover for years but now she’s to the point where she’s extremely overweight, binge eats when stressed, and then continues to suffer from the illness on a daily basis. I don’t want to be like that when I’m in my 40s. She’s even drove an eating disorder into her own daughter, and now I think she’s living through her. The second her severely underweight daughter gains even a little weight, she gets so pissed off and complains to her and my mother about it for HOURS. She’s like the real life ‘Ana’, for real.

I’m just so terrified to turn out like that. I would never be able to live with myself. I’m so scared of gaining weight the thought of it makes me nauseous.

So, as you may know, when a woman has anorexia, she can sometimes stop menstruating (or not start) due to the physical strain of the disease. This is called amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea is when a girl doesn't start her period past the age of 16 because she developed anorexia prior to starting her period. Secondary is when the period stops.

I had the secondary type, and a friend of mine had a primary type (we both only met at university, having both recovered). Both her and I have extremely severe periods, so much so that, in my case, I was hospitalised with anaemia and had to get an IUD despite being a flaming lesbian.

Since both her and I have this issue, I tried to find any studies on women who had amenorrhea and how heavy their periods are after recovering - either right after recovery or even years later. But all I see is fertility studies, which aren't really of interest to me anyway (again, flaming lesbian, who also happens to not want kids).

Now I'm not positing that there is a solid correlation or this thread will prove that is the case. I'm just curious to know if this is something other women have experienced, because from all the women I've known well in my life only 3 have had this mystery menorrhagia, and 2 of those have had amenorrhea - including myself, obviously. And hey, maybe someone can point to an article or study which does discuss this, because so far they have evaded me.","Anorexia, Amenorrhea, and Menstruation after recovery",https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/c5rbbb/anorexia_amenorrhea_and_menstruation_after/,1561585084.0,2019-06-26 10:38:04

I usually skip breakfast and lunch. I usually eat a small dinner. I have a nasty habit of sneaking bites of food when no one is home. Usually, after I'm done eating, I feel extremely guilty. I also have really bad anxiety and can't handle doing many things alone.

Today I had to take my grandma to her doctor's appointment. I decided I would eat lunch while I was waiting for her at a restaurant that I used to love, but haven't really gone to since I've been a kid as it tends to be out of the way (I just don't usually go by that town, I'm usually in the opposite direction).

I ate my ENTIRE lunch. A tbone steak as big as my plate. Two eggs. Hash browns. Toast. A glass of coffee and a glass of water. 

I didn't even feel guilty. I feel a little ""heavy"" but I know it's just because I'm feeling full. I'm just so insanely proud of myself. I'm a little anxious because I already had chicken marinating last night to make for dinner tonight and I know my boyfriend will make me eat at least a piece or two, but i think I can handle it!

I'm currently at my highest weight of 131lbs after my medication I've been on for my insomnia has been making me hungry literally all the time. I'd eat nearly half a loaf of bread and multiple bowls of cereal stacked up high, in a day almost every day for the past 5 or 6 months. After Christmas I'd gained 5 or 6lbs from my lowest weight of around 110lbs but I started slowly losing it again by fasting as I was still in school but only managed to lose 4 or 5lbs before I couldn't go to school any longer.

Around February I was put on medical leave because of my depression until this September where I'll be starting college 3 days a week. Obviously during this time I've been sat at home doing nothing which has lead me to eat more and more and not fast as I wake up absolutely starving and it feels so disgusting.

Now I'm at 131lbs and I can see a difference in how I look and when I brought up how my medication has made me gain weight to my mum she said that she noticed by didnt want to bring it up. Now I feel like a fat slob and I've noticed a few stretch marks on my hips and I've never cried so much in my life.

After my brother committed suicide i felt some relief from my depression in a way. I'd been suicidal for years but it kinda just went away I guess, or at least the urges to harm myself or try to end my life went away because I saw how it affected my family. But now I just want to die. I dont want to be a fat slob and feel so disgusting in my body.

I start college in September which will be all day for 3 days a week so I can fast all day then so I'll definitely lose some weight, and I've come off my medication and I've that I dont wake up fucking starving which is good. But I'm still at home all day every day and I really just want to be at college so I dont have time to eat and it seems like a century away and it's so upsetting. Sorry for ranting I'm just crying and hating myself so much right now and I dont have therapy for another week and I'm upset because my insomnia is so bad after coming off my medication and ugh.

PLEASE do not read if you’re sensitive to emotional stuff and those spiraling, bad thoughts, because that’s what is here

In only a few weeks I lost a ton and it all came back. I hate myself so much. I haven’t been eating. I recovered, and I gained A TON of weight. Still healthy, but it was just so overwhelming I couldn’t handle it. At first I was only working out to get muscle- now I don’t even have the motivation and I’m eating a low calorie thing or two a day. I’m obsessed with the scale. I feel so utterly helpless. I feel terrible. I’m starting to see the weird things again that happen when you’re too small, and I know I am, but when I look in the mirror I can’t see it. I feel like a whale. Taking up space in itself feels detrimental to my happiness. I don’t want to have to deal with this again, but I have no choice, I’m just stuck here. I wanted to “just be fit” but my version of that will always be stick thin. My boyfriend hasn’t noticed, well he has, but he doesn’t seem concerned. “Oh, you’re fasting again? Haha!” For the 294738th time in a week, and he congratulates me heavily on every pound I lose. (I know he prefers me when I’m 40 or so pounds heavier though.) It’s confusing and kind of odd but I’m scared because everybody noticed, they just don’t really care. 

I feel like a skeleton. No matter what I do I’m never my version of “desirable” skinny. It’s too much. It isn’t shaped right. Etc. I don’t think it’ll ever be enough. I’m scared that I might die, I feel helpless, I feel stupid, I feel worthless, I feel heavy (I’m 116 lbs) and I know I’m not but when I grab myself all I feel is squishy fat. If not, it’s hard but I can still GRAB. Grab grab grab, it never ends, I feel like I am dying. I feel like my mind is torturing me.

I’m need advice on how to help my girlfriend, who is developing what I think is a pretty serious eating disorder. I don’t know how to approach it and it is constantly weighing on me.

Just a bit about her. She has BPD and has suffered from some serious trauma, though this is the first time it has manifested this way. She started losing weight rapidly about two months ago and it took me a while to really catch on (cue stupid comments like ‘where did my favourite butt go?’). We have tried talking about it but it seems off limits and I don’t want to push. I also don’t want keep pushing food onto her at risk of adding bulimia because of it. It got to a point today where on top of not eating she doesn’t want milk in her coffee anymore.  She was very skinny to begin with and I think it’s getting dangerous.

I’m honestly looking for any bit of advice I can get. I know there’s no simple fix but at this point I’m scared of telling her she’s beautiful at risk of validating the weight loss in her mind.

1049,GhostKingThrowAway,1561263253,c3z12l,"Hey people,

Please delete if not allowed, but I'm seriously wondering if I'm running a risk for developing anorexia.
When I was a young teen, I used to despise my body. I did restrict food (skipping breakfast, no sweets, ect) but it never went far because my Mum found my search history and knew that I'd looked up 'How to be anorexic without your parents knowing.' 
Over the years I'm reasonably fine with my body. I don't hate my appearance but I don't love it either. I've always wanted to get fit and lose weight but I'm scared this is going to spiral out of control. 
Here are my warning signs. One, I'm depressed, have chronic anxiety and have been previously suicidal. Mum told me recently that she always thought I'd be a candidate for anorexia, because of all the self hate going on. Funnily enough, I believe her. Two, when I lost a shit ton of weight when I was having panic attacks (stopped eating cause it made me ill, the smallest I'd ever been) and my family pointed it out, I felt super proud. I was skin and bones but remember thinking 'at least something's going right for me.' Three, when I lost a considerable amount of weight at uni super recently because of a nervous breakdown (I stopped eating), I felt like I'd accomplished something  again.
These are the things that are worrying me the most. I spiral out of control very quickly. I've been mentally ill since I was eleven and I know how easy it is for me to fall down rabbit holes. I'm scared of getting anorexia because it'd literally kill me. Despite me previously having deleted it a few weeks ago (became worried with how obsessed I'd become with logging kjs/cal) I downloaded Lose It again last night and logged what I'd eaten throughout the day. I set my goal weight to 49 kg (108 lbs) which would be incredibly tiny for me and felt proud when my total kjs/cals fell under my target by several hundred. I'm by no means a big girl (ten kilos below the average weight for women my age in my country) and me losing so much weight would be super obvious to my parents, and they already think I'm already too thin because of my anxiety. 
This year I started spending considerable amounts of time living alone (not living at home), and I'm old enough now to not eat when I'm not at home without parental guidance and probably get away with it. I feel like I'm already planning eating less if I go back, and that scares me.
Once again, please delete if not allowed, but do you think I run the risk? 
I've already cut down on certain foods entirely and am eating less than I usually would. Even when I'm hungry, I wait as long as possible before I eat.

1058,KyotosMusic,1561168499,c3jqnj,"Hi, Kyo here. This is my first post on the sub. I've added a trigger flare, but I just want to let you know, I don't talk about how I do this, ('ex: I skip (insert meal) by...'), but I do mention my weight and BMI multiple times, I also mention the habits that I have that could be common with eating disorders. This may not be effective, but please don't read this if it'll trigger you. I've been looking for something that could answer my questions, but the more I look around, the more confused I get. I've done a lot of research on anorexia and still can't decide, but it would be great to get a different opinion, even if you don't know for sure.

This started in March, a bit before BMI was taken for school. Before I was overweight (5""3', 136 lbs), and I was just doing this to get a healthy BMI. I started skipping lunch, and lost about 6 pounds in 3-4 weeks. My BMI was healthy (24.7), but only barely. I still wanted to lose weight. I felt so fat, so... disgusting. Every time I snacked, even though it was mainly because I didn't want people to worry about me, I would purge when no one could hear me. I thought (well, still think) snacking makes me weak, and if I can show more self-control, I'll be stronger.

In May, I started to skip breakfast as well as lunch, and noticed more rapid weight loss. People started to notice, but I denied it. I knew if I let on that I was consciously losing weight, they would try to force me to eat more than they already try. They said I was thinner, skinner. I don't believe them. All I see is that fat stomach, my thighs expanding so much when I sit down. I'm now at a healthy weight for my age (13), 5'5"" and 116 pounds.

On good days, I eat less than 600 calories. I don't have much time to exercise, but when I do, I do whenever possible. On bad days, I can eat up to 1200, which makes me feel really bad. My appetite hasn't completely gone, even though it's been reduced a lot. I get tired so much easier, and even every day activities make me want to pass out. I've been counting calories, and I don't know if I can stop. 

I know this is unhealthy, but not sure if it's anorexic. I know I ahould stop, but I don't want to gain all of the weight back. Also, I never mentioned this, but I'm not ready to tell my parents yet. So anything that involves telling them I will consider, but I may not use it yet.

P.S. The weight I put was my weight as of a few days ago, so I don't know if it changed. I can't weigh myself every day since I don't have a scale of my own, I weigh myself in a family members' room, and they hardly ever leave for long enough.",Am I anorexic?

Fortunately, she came to us for help. We're trying to meet with a nutritionist to help us, but in the meantime we're planning all of her meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner plus snacks after each meal.) This was based on the feedback of her therapist who is knowledgeable about eating disorders but not a specialist.

Most of the advice I've read online talks about how to handle refeeding for someone who doesn't really want to cooperate. Things like don't use napkins since they may hide food in them, or don't get up from the table until they're done eating, etc.

In a way, we have the opposite problem. She's incredibly hungry all the time, and she eats everything we give her. Unfortunately the weight gain is making her depressed as is the fact that even after she has a big meal and 3 largish snacks, she's *still* hungry all the time.

I think she's mostly returned to her old weight. My question is, should we actually reduce the portions we're giving her? Or should we encourage her to eat until she's full?

I've talked to her about her eating habits (in a non-judgemental way), and she makes it sound like she wants to eat, but she gets stomach aches very easily.

The other day we went out to eat, and she got 4 pieces of sushi and a stir fry bowl. When the sushi arrived, she immediately tried to pawn off pieces to us. ""Anyone want to have some? My stir fry is coming later, and it's plenty of food.""

1101,smokingatthepark,1562792993,cbmi7g,"Hi there , I'm a 21 year old 6'6 man  thats been suffering from an for the past year and a half and I'm really not sure what to do anymore. I moved across the country last year in the hopes of meeting new people, finding a new job , and being surrounded by a new environment, unfortunately I brought my an with me, and although it wasn't ""that bad"" at the time of moving here, it quickly picked up and threw me in a downwards spiral. Within a month of moving here I became unable to leave my own apartment or even socialize with my roommates (who I already knew before moving here) because I thought I was overweight and couldn't deal with the idea of anyone looking at me and inadvertently completely walled myself off from society .  I  got my own apartment 2 months later and have lived here since, but after moving out of my old place I slowly lost contact with the people I lived with and spent the next 4 months without seeing a single person I knew. In those months I wasn't able to find/look for work because I thought that I was so ugly and fat that as soon as I would leave the establishment after dropping off my resume the workers would mock me and talk amongst themselves about how I have no shot working there because of my appearance. So I had no job, no friends, and an eating disorder that was kicking my ass. I was able to find a job mid January this year through a friend from back home at a bar but had to end up quitting after two months because the work environment was filled with straight up disgusting  toxic masculinity, and because of my height and broad shoulders douchey men just assume that I'm a ""bro"" like them and treat me like one of them, which started to take an even bigger toll on me because I was suffering really badly from my an. Fast forward 4 months later to today I still have no friends really, no job, and can feel my an getting worse and worse, I haven't eaten in 2 days and spent 5 hours yesterday in my bathroom in pitch dark going in and out of my steaming hot bathtub trying to sweat out whatever weight  I could squeeze out of my body, and was too scared to open my bathroom door because its facing my kitchen and I didn't want to see the food I had available. I also ran into my old roommate today who knows about my an and lovingly told me I'd started to look like skin'n'bones. I now weigh  about 175-180 pounds and have lost about 70 or 80 pounds since moving here ( I weighed 290 when graduating highschool 3 years ago)  and I don't know what to do anymore, I see a therapist that I really like and have no problems talking about my an to her but at the same time talking about it doesn't really seem to do anything to stop it. I'm running out of hope right now and I'm scared of this taking over my life more than it already is, or even killing me, but at the same time am equally terrified of putting on any weight. There's a free government run mental health institute in my city that apparently has a good Eating Disorder program that I've been thinking about checking myself into but am also extremely hesitant to.

No treats on weekdays and only a biscuit or a lolly on the weekends! Tv and computer time was limited to 2 hours a day and was used as a punishment. I was often forced to stay outside till dinner time. One Sunday my dad poured me a large bowl of cereal when I was about 8, as I was eating it she shouted at him saying I wouldn't fit through a door by the time I was 10. I was an athletic child and was a dancer and a competitive runner and I also did horse riding. 11 was when I stopped eating treats offered and if I ate them I had to run or cycle for hours to stay skinny (I was 3 stone when I was 10) family members complained I was too skinny but I loved hearing it.
At 15 I stopped eating breakfast and lunch. I used to crush cereal into a bowl and add some milk and leave it in the sink. I dumped my lunch and tried to eat dinner alone so I could dump anything I deemed too unhealthy or fattening. I fainted on a walk home from school and had very low iron! I gradually got a bit better but would never allow my weight to go above 7.5 stone! (I'm 5""6) I constantly relapsed and hit under 6 stone each time before making changes. I went into inpatient treatment at 18 where I was officially diagnosed with anorexia. I am now 22, 5""6 and just under 7 stone...I still won't allow myself to go above 7.5 and still hold the rules of no liquid calories, no cakes or biscuits or sweets in general, trim fat and press grease out of any food with a higher fat content, no food unless I've gone 15 hours without eating from the previous day, no butter in sandwiches, boiling chicken and veg and never adding oil, no eating off others plates, and I typically eat the same thing all the time because I know the calorie content and don't have to search, weigh and worry
I'm slowly trying to break these habits! Last week I had a sugary drink, didn't squeeze out the grease from some sausages, ate some crisps without weighing them, did not weigh myself.

She said she would ground me from reading, crocheting, my cat, my computer, my phone, basically everything that keeps me entertained during the summer unless I ate three pieces of chicken. I hate it.

1133,knotanissue,1563505355,cf26qw,"So I actually had to make a throwaway account for this because my long-distsnce gf knows my actual account and I don't want her to discover this confession before I'm willing to admit it to her. But basically, I'm 19 now and my first struggles with anorexia/anorexic tendencies happened when I was 12. For a few years now I wouldn't have considered myself anorexic. Typically days that I wouldn't eat or I would eat little just occurred due to lack of appetite from my depression/anxiety. But that wasn't often enough to cause concern for me. Or so I thought.
I recently returned to my parents' home for the summer after my first year in college. I went to the doctor for a yearly checkup where my weight was taken (first time I had access to a scale in a while). Turned out I was 10 pounds under what I thought I had been. My estimation is that I lost this weight over a course of maye 6 to 8 months, completely unintentionally.
So from that day, my thinking got really fucked again. I became/have become terrified of gaining that weight back because this instance reminded me how much more comfortable I feel with losing weight as opposed to gaining it. My anorexic relapse didn't set in immediately, but the more I thought about it, the more it bothered me, so in the past few days I've fallen back into old, destructive habits. The whole calorie-restricting, exercising, avoiding fattening foods - that kind of thing.
I guess what I'm here for is just to be able to voice this as I haven't spoken to anyone about it. And also to ask for advice as to whether or not I should tell my girlfriend. She already knows I have trouble opening up and we're also long distance so she can't really see me in the case that I'm not eating or am losing weight. I have no doubt that she'll be supportive and try to help me back towards recovery (she knows I've previously struggled with this prior to dating her) but I'm afraid of how I'll continue to engage with her after she discovers. I don't know if I'll become more embarrassed and reclusive and standoffish. I don't know if I'll appreciate her efforts or one day forget that her actions are out of love and shun her. My self-consciousness can really make me a bitch sometimes.
I just don't want her to find out when she inevitably visits me again while I'm back in college. I don't want her to see I've lost so much weight and I'm not eating when I'm with her and she feel betrayed that I haven't been honest with her all this time. That's my main drive to tell her. I just don't know if or how I should.

1137,Dopamine-dreams,1563477599,cewwxq," 

Hello, I am a 20 year old male who recently started recovering from an intense bout of anorexia thought I'd share my story here. 

This isn’t the first bout I dealt with as I experienced it a few times as a teenager, but this winter it returned and got worse than it’s ever been before. I wasn’t in the best place leading up to winter and around November I started losing weight.  I live in northeast and winters can be pretty brutal up here. I also work at a busy restaurant in a ski town where we are very short staffed. I am one of two busers that work there, and my coworker/buser is very lazy and would show up intoxicated most shifts and would generally do very little, leaving me to bus almost the whole restaurant on my own. I had already started to lose weight around November and by the time mid January arrived I had gotten really skinny. Around this time business really started to pick up as we entered busy season. I was stretched so thin at work that all shift I'd pretty much have to run around and do damage control. So on top of my eating disorder I was dealing with a lot of stress from work. And all my coworkers noticed. However, none of them though I had an eating disorder and all of them though I had a coke problem. They talked about it a lot behind my back. I’m have Bipolar, which I had been off my meds for, and paired with my lack of eating, had greatly thrown off my mood. My coworkers noticed this as well and wrongly attributed it to cocaine. It progressively got worse until mid march where business slowly down and I moved into a new apartment. I was less stressed out and I began eating more. My coworkers then started to show me more support and would often ask about how I was doing with the new apartment. That was nice to receive but it still hurt a lot to have everyone think I was addicted to coke when I was struggling with anorexia. People judged me, lost respect for me, and spread rumors about me. I don’t like playing the victim card but I honestly feel a little betrayed and thought my coworkers would have had more respect for me than that. What gets me is that those two things are very different and if someone would have reached out to me they might have discovered what was up, but instead of reaching out to me they all just talked about it behind my back. I don’t know who to share this with so I just thought I’d share it here. Thank you to all who will read this, it does help.",Anorexia was misperceived as a cocaine addiction.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cewwxq/anorexia_was_misperceived_as_a_cocaine_addiction/,1563499199.0,2019-07-18 14:19:59

1148,hi-I-am-sloth,1563384849,ceg12d,"Ok. So this might be long 😩 

My mother was constantly criticizing my weight ... putting me on diets, fasts, laxatives... 

I developed an eating disorder at 13, and began a really horrific restricting/binging/purging cycle that turned into a 4 year battle with myself. I was hospitalized for self harm and my eating disorder at 17. I became extremely agoraphobic and dropped out of high school, and stopped leaving my house because of the fear of judgement regarding my weight. I couldn’t go on dates with my boyfriend (whom I eventually married! ❤️) I couldn’t walk during graduation, I couldn’t make or keep friends.... my eating disorder controlled my entire life. 

I did recover and honestly those were the best years of my life!! 

However my husband and I suffered a really traumatic pregnancy loss and I began to binge again. I binged and binged and binged and convinced myself that at least I was eating. 

I became so depressed I couldn’t get out of bed. Nothing helped. Nothing was fun. Nothing was ok. I wanted to die.... I was going to kill myself. 

I told my husband and he sprung into action and got me help. I am on anti anxiety medication and antidepressants now. 

I reached the embarrassingly high number of 283lbs during my depression. 

My medication made me lose my urge to binge .... and I think I am taking advantage of it... I have stopped eating breakfast and lunch. I have switched to low calorie vegan meals for dinner. I get panicked when I feel full and want to purge ... I weigh myself a minimum of 3 times a day. I have lost 20lbs in 2 1/2 weeks... I am scared of food again. 

I can’t find the happy balance between my losing weight for my health (because I need to desperately...) and it spiraling into an eating disorder again.

1149,m0nkiwi,1563383241,cefoeu,"So all my life I kinda struggled with myself and my body. I always thought I wasn't good enough and fat. I can remember that always in the back of my head this voice kept saying, you need to work out eat health and lose weight. I tried a few times but I never really could do it so I gave up after a few weeks. But this time was different. 


Last November or so something inside me changed. I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't keep living like this ""fat"" person. So I started restricting. My mom always gave me 2 slices of bread to school and I threw them away. I only ate 1 apple and like 10 slices of cucumber during the whole school day (8.30 am - 4.00/5.00 pm) ,if I had a good day I ate a banana or some yoghurt before school, if I had a bad day I would eat less. I always ate dinner and sometimes even a small snack at night. I tried fasting for 12 or more hours (starting at night and trying to go on during the day). I felt terrible every day but I thought it was only for now and I would be happy as soon as I was beautiful. But it only got worse. My ribs were showing and I loved it (now that they barely show I miss it) but it wasn't healthy. 


I needed to change so I started telling my friends. They wanted me to get better so I tried. At first I couldn't so I pretended I was getting better. Then I want on a vacation and there was a lot of food and I had to eat with my parents 3 times a day for like 10 days. This is where my recovery really started. I ate everyday. At first I ate so much because I was starving but then I got sick of it. I wasn't feeling hungry anymore and I felt terrible. Being full sucked. I kept telling myself when I get home I can be empty again. But I couldn't. 



I started a new job in a kitchen. I have to eat there 2/3 times a week and if I don't eat they notice. So now 9 months later I'm healthy again. When I started my job I was on the edge of being underweight. Now I'm heavier than I was before all this started and I'm feeling physically better but mentally worse. Now that I know I'm the heaviest I have ever been I want to restrict again. I made a plan to start restricting again when schools starts. i'm slowly starting to work out again and I know if I'm not careful I fall back into that rabbit hole. I'm afraid, of my past, of my present and of my future. But I know if I keep holding on I will be ok.

My insurance coverage ends the end of this month and I’m still trying to figure out what to do about it. But that means instead of staying in iop for 6 months like my team wants me to, I’ll be leaving only 2 months in. 

I know I’m not ready because I’m already planning a relapse that I don’t feel like is a relapse (losing “just a little weight” aka getting back down to my size before but in a “healthier way” aka by overexercising instead of just restricting food intake). 

Without insurance, I have no support and my body image has just proceeded to get worse and worse. I know I’m going to weigh myself as soon as I get home and my team just tells me “bUt wHaT iF u DoNt”, like that helps at all. 

I want to move forward in life and be happy and well, but not if I can’t be in the body I want. And I hate that I STILL feel this way. 

I thought treatment was going to cure me but now I’m just fat (“within normal” medically) and sad, when at least before I was skinny and sad.

The line that made me realize this was along the lines of “Anorexia is rarely about being thin, its about control.” And that made me realize that today i was trying to make it without eating at all, but as time went on it was less about cutting calories and more about how disciplined i was and how much self-control i had gained since a week ago.

There was also a post that showed what “healthy” people do in situations surrounding food (such as snacking or eating things they weren’t expecting to) and i realized that in most of those cases i was not a “healthy” person. The one that hit me hard was the one that said “healthy people dont drown their hunger with water” which is exactly how ive been restricting myself recently.

Anyways at the worst of my eating disorder I went vegan, with a whole bunch of restrictions on top of being plant-based. Since then I’ve stuck with being vegan, but for the animals and not for restriction. I guess you could say my relationship with food is better now. Since I’ve started my recovery I’m more comfortable eating foods that have oils and are processed when in the past I wouldn’t. However, I still struggle a bit every now and then, and I guess right now I am struggling. 

As of late things have been pretty bad. At the beginning of summer I started counting calories again, but since a month ago I have stopped. I’m currently in a situation where I don’t buy veggie “meats” very often and I feel that that has improved my relationship with food because I find myself more inspired to cook. In addition, it has been good on my wallet too, because I find myself using up a lot of the groceries I buy. However, my lack of buying these pre-made, quick and easy veggie “meats” has in some way warped my relationship with food, yet again. Just recently I bought a pack of veggie nuggets, and I’ve eaten them all within a day, because they are there and they are easy to make. But after I eat them I find myself feeling guilty for eating these processed foods. Even though I know they are not high in calories and that calories don’t matter I still feel ashamed and feel like i need to compensate with “healthier” and “cleaner” foods to eat. 

It just sucks to feel this way. I feel like it will never end. Even when I think my relationship with food is better my ed still finds its way back into my life.

1200,WeakFeet,1563863015,cgox8e,"I first developed my eating disorder in my previous relationship, wherein I never felt that I met the beauty standard of my previous girlfriend. I felt she wasn’t satisfied with my body, and my anxieties were practically confirmed when it came out she had been sexting my skinny friends throughout the duration of our relationship. At the time I weighed about 132 lbs, and by the end of our two year run, I weighed 103 lbs. 

Highschool started and I was back up to 126 lbs. I consider that a bit chubby, but I never did anything about it. 
I started a relationship my sophmore year with a senior. Honestly, looking back there were a lot of red flags. Every time we’d do something sexual, he would show me porn after of very, VERY thin women as if it were an example for me. I don’t want to blame him, because he’s been very supportive in trying to get me to eat again, but I can’t bring myself to forgive him. 
It’s been a year and some months later since we began dating. I lost 20 lbs over the duration of my junior year, weighing roughly 116 lbs. that brings me to today, where I have lost another 5 lbs and I am trying to get below 100. I want to hit 80 someday. I’m 5’3”, so it isn’t out of the realm of possibility. 

My boyfriend also would talk about his exes bodies a lot early on. He would tell me everything he liked about them. He even showed me pictures he kept. He sometimes made offhand comments about my body, such as how in a photo I “look like a fat girl trying to hide the fact that she’s fat” or “your boobs are getting smaller.” 

I try to bring this stuff up now– since I didn’t realize how manipulative it was at the time– but he accuses me of dwelling on the past, and that if I can’t forgive and accept what he did, he’ll break up with me. 

My inability to talk about it has lead me to some obsessive tendencies, such as stalking pornstars that I remember him showing me as thinspo.

A couple years ago I was studying abroad (despite being hella poor) shortly after a severe allergic reaction that landed me in the hospital; these things combined meant I ate less than a thousand calories like in a weekend and averaged a walking/hiking distance of 15-20 miles. Like I lived off of bread, Nutella, fruit, and maybe one hot meal if I could afford in for 3-4 days out of the week. I loved it. I weighed less than I ever had and all my clothes practically fell off me.

Two years later and I’ve been back in the stages for a while and got myself into recovery. My loved ones were super supportive and I felt great for a little while. I think I’ve regressed though.

I started counting my calories again but I told myself it was to “make sure I was eating enough.” I constantly examine my body and hate to be naked for any period of time because then I can’t hide from myself.

When I was at my smallest my size was why most people consider normal or “healthy.” I have an auto immune disease that makes it hard to lose/not gain weight so now that I’m back to my original weight I’m considered overweight. I can feel people giving me disgusted looks again, I know they’re judging me but I can’t help it. I eat right, I exercise regularly, I love healthy but I can’t get back to where I was when I restricted.

So yesterday I went to urgent care for a painful lump (I found out it was a swollen lymph node, so I’m doing ok) and they weighed me. I decided to look at my weight, and found that I gained roughly 34lb while in treatment. When I first developed my ED I weighed 304lb. Over a year or so I dropped to 232. I now weigh 266, which upsets me because I still don’t consider myself healthy. The professionals who monitor my weight tell me that gaining weight is normal after restricting for so long, and I believe them but I didn’t think it was THIS much weight. I’m just trying to accept the fact that my weight is where it is, and that as long as I’m eating good and exercising normally my body will eventually even out. And obviously if the weight gain wasn’t normal, they would have told me and taken action to fix it right?

My mom booked me for my first therapy session, with a 65 year old women who specializes in veteran and cancer affairs (along with grief, ptsd, and life-changes). I’m a nineteen year old who calculates her tdee every five minutes. She didn’t know what anything meant and I don’t think she picked up on some of my ticks, but she was super kind. And that made it a lil easier. I don’t think she and I will work but I promised my mom I’d go for one more session before school starts. The therapist and I didn’t get to divulge much into my ed but I talked to her a lot about how my mom is a huge trigger and I get overwhelmed by her easily, but I could never tell my mom that because then my mom lashes out and victimizes herself. That was nice to say out loud though. So it was okay. I didn’t cry from being overwhelmed so that’s good I guess. 

However. I came home and my mom made a huge dinner as a celebration for going to therapy (Mac and cheese, stuff with cream cheese, vegetables with oiLLLLL, and fried tofu) and I just ran up to my room and cried. I’m never gonna get better until I can go back to college god help me

Okay, so I knew about Anorexia for a long time, I know what it is, I know the effects on your body, on your mental health... I was really interested on the subjects, and did some research... and one of my closest friend is recovering from it (and she is doing great, like she can eat cookies and food like that, i'm so happy for her) so I really thought that i was the last person who would end up in the situation i'm in now.
Nothing to worry about, i think, but still...
I don't like my body, I'm 16, no one likes its body during adolescence. I want to lose weight, I don't like sport. I don't know how,  i ended up thinking ""yeaaah, starving is not a good diet, it's just the easiest way to end up being trapped in Anorexia, and struggling with it for years, with sometimes no hope for recovery, but... I want to look good for when i come back to school in september !""
I don't want to look too skinny though. Like, not being like a squeleton, just have a flat stomach and thin hands.   
I counted my calories for like, five days, but when I started to be supper upset when I ate more than 900 calories a day I was like ""Okay, it's NOT looking good, I need to stop"". I think I lost like one kilogram or something in five days. I'm not sure, my scale is weird.
I'm forced to eat every day, i live with my parents, and my mom is really careful with that kind of stuff. Like, she notice really easily when I don't eat a lot. I have great parents, I really do. And I enjoy eating, but then after, I'm alone in my room, and I feel all the food in my stomach, and i feel really bad.
I purged a bit also. I don't like it. I know all the side effects, I know how dangerous it is, I know that it's not really efficient. but i still do it sometimes. Less than before (a few weeks ago, I would go into the bathroom with food that I liked when I was sure my parents were in another part of the apartment, i would eat it very fast with a lot of water, and purge in the bathtub. gross. but it felt good :""(   )
I feel bad when I eat a lot, I started to do a bit of sports. I don't count my calories, but I like to do an approximation of my daily intakes. I tried to stay under 1000, though I don't think that I'm good at it. 
I like food ! but I don't like how I have no control when it comes to it. I don't really binge ? Eating a lot because I have a family thing like birthdays and stuff, yes but I don't' have this sort of ""crisis"", eating a lot on the bathroom to purge after it yes, but I stay conscious, I know what I'm doing sort of. 
Yeah it's messy sorry.


&gt; I have a bad relationship with eating and with my body, that's for sure.
But I also feel like i'm doing all this on purpose, to make myself interesting. 
Faking an eating disorder kind of stuff. But that's messed up, why would I do this ???? I talked to no one about my ""problems"". (well, expect this post)

So yeah. My parents will be away for two weeks. I used this time alone to eat as little as I can. I know I shouldn't. But I want to starve. I'm a terrible person. What kind of monster wants to starve ? 
  &gt; I want to have a eating disorder to lose weight. Worst idea ever. I don't want to stop, but I should.

came to accept that one of the reasons why i try so hard to keep my weight as low as i can is to prevent my breasts growing, i used to have bigger breasts but as i lost weight in the last year they shrunk significantly to the point where i dont see myself needing a binder to compress my chest as often. I’m not in a position where i can freely present but bind anyway for myself to feel comfortable (im non-binary, wanting to appear more masc). My thighs and chest triggers my body dysmorphia the most as I hate the parts of myself that make me ‘feminine’, i always wish my fat distribution was similar to male bodies and if i was like that i know i wouldnt be so hell bent on restricting myself constantly. 

anyone else with similar struggles? 

i also have the same issues with having control many others have, so i cant say its solely due to my self-loathing of my feminine body, just one of the factors why i keep trying so hard.

I opted for a 2l bottle of pepsi max when I left.. I've drank it all in a few hours (yes I'm aware of fluid intoxication but my body seems oddly capable of handling that, probably due to history/experience).

I opted for that instead of a 'meal deal' (sandwich, snack and drink offer). In other words, that's my evening meal gone.

Granted, I ate 10 hours ago. My issue is I'm now constantly hearing the thoughts again. I'm fat. I'm disgusting, a failure. Worthless. An embarrassment. Grotesque. Repulsive, hideous individual. A waste of space. I shouldn't eat for a month. More than a month.

Pepsi max used to be my crutch through periods of fasting 2-4 consecutive days. One August I'd fasted the entire month and binge-purged the rest.

I can't BP any longer due to esophagitis I'm on medication for. I'm now resigned to enduring fasts and gross levels of restriction.

1246,thomel02,1564493286,cjrrmu,"So my therapist brought up the most terrifying words in my mind yesterday -- higher level of care. I have been seeing my therapist since January and I haven't gained any weight yet. I've gained a few pounds, but was never able to keep the weight on. I have had anorexia for 11 years and I've been in therapy for the majority of that time and I've also been inpatient twice.

I have about 10 pounds to gain to not be underweight and I just feel like I can't go through inpatient again at this point. I was in a mentally dark place both times I was inpatient and I was crying nonstop. Plus, the rate of weight gain is so quick in the inpatient program I would return to (it's in one of the best hospitals in the U.S.) and I remember having a mental breakdown over how quickly I was putting on weight each morning before I got weighed. In addition, the goal weight they have set for me means that I have to gain almost 17 pounds, which is so inconceivable for me right now. I don't really want to gain weight, but I know that I have to and I'm trying to trust my therapist because I really like her and I know she has my best interests in mind.

**Anyway, for anyone that managed to gain weight on an outpatient basis, how did you do it and handle the anxiety and stress that came along with it?** I am able to see my weight when my therapist weighs me and seeing the number go up (even though I know it has to) makes me scared to keep eating so much. I honestly am eating more than I ever have on my own (I'm 26) and I have never been this motivated to keep trying. I'm currently eating 3 meals and 3 snacks a day and my metabolism has always been really high, so putting on weight is impossible (I was put on 4,000 calories both times due to inadequate weight gain when I was inpatient, which wasn't that common).

I took a year off law school and went through 3 AN treatment facilities and am in recovery now, but I can’t eat and It doesn’t feel the same as AN. I like being underweight, but for the first time it scares me bc I CANT EAT. I’m never hungry and when i am putting food in my mouth, it disgusts me ( i get shivers and gaggy) and the interest in eating goes away. I have dreams about eating and I can eat normally in my dreams, but in real life i have such an aversion to food. 

I’ve been fainting or having seizures. My mom witnessed one and swears it was a seizure, but the ER doc who put staples in my head thinks I just fainted, and i somewhat agree. I get very dizzy upon standing and have 0 energy to do anything. I shake uncontrollably. 

When I was in my ED I still had an appetite, and wanted to eat more, but now I don’t. It just feels very different from anorexia nervosa and if something doesn’t change I’m afraid I might actually die this time. Idk what to do. Everybody blames everything on the eating disorder and it just feels so different this time that I think there might be something more but I have no idea what that could be. 

My BMI is in the 14’s and I really feel like I’m just completely unable to eat enough calories to sustain my life and I’m afraid because it really, really might kill me this time and I don’t feel like I have any control over it, like i did in the past. I’m also afraid that all my symptoms are so easily blamed on the anorexia and depression diagnosis that something more might be at play and it would just go completely unnoticed by medical professionals. 

Everyday tasks are so difficult, they’re insurmountable. I don’t know how to tell this to anybody because it’s so easily explained by anorexia nervosa and depression. 

Maybe it’s just me wanting it to not be a mental illness, but a physical one that has me convinced that it must be something different. 

I don’t know what to do at this point I feel like I’ve exhausted all my options.

1252,anxioushypochondriac,1564429959,cjgf6o,"I got my period at 9 and was a lot more developed than all my friends. I was made fun of for having “boobs” and being “fat” and I constantly worried about bleeding everywhere. 

I stopped eating gradually and towards the end I ended up only having 1 low calorie protein shake every day. I still remember the nutritional content of that beverage. 

I conned my parents into thinking I just wanted to be a vegetarian, then that I didn’t want dairy, then that I didn’t like blah blah blah. I remember having to tie the bottoms of my swimsuits with my hair ties so they wouldn’t fall down. I remember my face looking frail and sunken in. I wasn’t “fat” (holding more fat like a menstruating woman does, just at a very young age) like the kids called me anymore, but i couldn’t ride my bike or walk up stairs without feeling like i would faint. I remember spending an hour and a half eating a single yogurt cup. I wanted to eat, but I couldn’t allow myself to.

My parents forced me to the facility where they evaluated me and i remember saying I didn’t want to be over 80 lbs but i would gain 10 lbs because i knew that’s what they wanted to hear.  
They told my parents I could have died at any second these past few months at this very low weight. 

They rushed me to the hospital across the street in a wheel chair, kept me there for 10 days, half of which i wasn’t allowed to get up to go to the bathroom which was literally 3 feet from my bed. It was the first time I had seen my father cry, when he saw me in that hospital bed hooked up to an IV, promising the doctors I didn’t need a feeding tube.

I once didn’t eat the two fork-fulls of broccoli left on my dinner plate within the 30 minute time limit and was forced to drink a shot of Boost nutritional drink and go down a phase. I conned my way out of the phase part because i told the doctor that the nurse told me if I did well at breakfast I could eat lunch with the others, which was true. I still remember begging to finish my broccoli, if they had just given me 5 more minutes to finish those two bites. 

I spent 10 and a half weeks in inpatient (kind of, we went home at night and went to public school on Tuesdays and stayed home on weekends so kind of loose term for inpatient) and 10 weeks In outpatient. I wasn’t allowed out of the inpatient program until my period came back which took longer than they expected. 

I stunted my growth at 5’1” (I was a pretty tall kid at 5’ in third and fourth grade) and my period remains irregular. 

I still think of food a lot. I never didn’t enjoy eating, but I didn’t think i deserved it and I wanted control and I wanted to be accepted by my peers. I still have kind of an unhealthy relationship with food, but now that I have health anxiety it’s more about “am I getting enough xyz” and restricting myself to whatever those dietary means should be, but I’m working on it. I never skip a meal or restrict my calories or over exercise anymore.

I now am at a healthy weight and have been for 10 years. I enjoy peanut butter and carbs of all kinds and letting myself indulge in chocolate. 

I have since forgotten who that 9 year old girl was inside, but I feel empathy towards her. I know that little girl is still within me. But she deserves food and she deserves healthy control. She deserved a better childhood, but I can grant a better adulthood. 

Thank you to my doctors and, ultimately, myself for getting through what I now know could have easily been the death of me.

Mental health still plagues me, but I know if that 9 year old little girl could fight this, that this 19 year old woman can fight anything. I just forget a lot.

I love making them and how much other enjoy them. But at school in English class we were sorta just talking about our dream future careers at my table. And I said that I wanted to own my own bakery one day. And they sorta just laughed and said but all you eat is paper you don’t eat real food. And see the background to this is from a few months prior to that day we were talking about our favorite foods and I go from eating more to eating less to days when I just completely despise food so I was despising food that day so they were like “do you like bagels” and I just kept saying no to everything saying it all tasted disgusting. So they were like “well what do you eat so you don’t die then since you hate everything?” They were just joking but me being a awkward person something I do is just act like a total idiot to get out of the situation. So I tore a piece of paper and shoved it in my mouth and said “Me love paper” “paper yummy in my tummy” and they started laughing their heads of and I actually chewed the paper then swallowed it. (Does anyone know what happens when you eat paper I mean it was a tiny piece but still is it bad to do I mean I don’t actually eat paper just that one time) So they were laughing their heads off thus me only eating paper came in to play.

And so I was just saying I was shopping for some more shirts and she sorta ask what size?

So I told her and she scoff and said that she was looking for clothes for her daughter (younger than me) and couldn’t find anything nice because of how big she was. And she pointed over to her. And I could tell this lady was just being a bitch because her daughter yes was a tad overweight maybe 10-15 pounds but not drastic. And so her daughter comes over and is saying she found something that she liked blah blah blah. And this lady starts going off to her like “well you would have found more if you would just loose some weight. This nice girl here is older than you and is smaller” and she just kept pointing over at me using me as a good example of what a nice pretty girl should look like. And I was just standing their awkwardly and sorta trying to walk away. I now wish I said something but I didn’t I just felt bad for this girl.

I used to struggle hard with anorexia. Growing up I always got comments telling me how skinny and pretty I was. I recall my mom telling me that ""It's a good thing you're thin. Fat girls don't look good in your style."" I confused thin with beauty and when I started to gain weight during puberty, my world fell apart. The most of 7th grade year was me dealing with my disorder and giving into it. Eventually I was able to break free. I managed to beat anorexia on my own but it's coming back and I'm scared.


Every year my family goes on a camping trip, 3 days, in the deep forest with no signal. This year they brought along 2 other families that I didn't really know. I suffer from massive anxiety as well, and part of that anxiety makes it so that I can't eat in front of people unless I'm 100% comfortable with everyone. The first night was a potluck. Everyone is expected to eat together, so I made the excuse that I was tired and went to bed. In the morning I ""slept in"" to avoid breakfast and went on a small hike right before lunch was announced. I avoided every meal announcement. The entire trip was like that. At the end of those three days I had eaten only an apple and half a bag of chips. But what felt worse then the hunger was me realizing how good it felt to be hungry.

I think I have always had disordered traits eating wise since there is a lot of food I don't like because of its texture or smell. I like to arrange my food on the plate and have it ordered in a certain way. But I never thought anything of it. 

Recently I've lost the desire to eat (I think due to medication I'm on) and have lost weight. I fainted few weeks ago due to skipping meals. I've noticed on the scale I have lost weight and today weighted myself and was 100lbs. It made me really happy but I can't help but think I should continue. 

The last few months I've been looking at a specific forum calling out pro-anorexia accounts. I found the thread randomly and just looked at it out of boredom but now I'm obsessed.

I've always been attached to being skinny. I think I'm the ugliest out of all my family but I've always been the smallest. My family are all overweight so I've always been the skinny one and every time I see my family they make  comments like ""you've lost weight"" ""look how skinny you are"". I'm not actively trying to starve myself but looking at the way I've been acting the last few months and comparing myself to the people in that pro-ana thread i can't help but think this is getting bad. My BMI is 18.6 and being 100lbs at 5'1 isn't a big deal but I'm worried about the way I've started to think and act about food...

Unfortunately, that all changed over a year ago. I had nexplanon put in my arm because I was tired of birth control pills, and it ramped up my appetite and led to over 30 pounds of rapid, rapid weight gain. For the first time I had stretch marks, rolls, a double chin. I felt disgusting. The clothes, which I used to love, no longer fit me anymore leading to me crying almost every morning when I was faced with having to get dressed. I finally realized the implant was the culprit and got it removed in January. Since then, I’ve lost a little over 20 pounds. I’m 5’5 and at my heaviest I was 178, with a starting weight of 145. I’m currently at 157. Since finally hitting the 150’s though, it’s been so difficult to lose the extra weight. 

Now, I never want to eat because of it. I don’t want to even snack because when I consume anything but water, it will trigger normal hunger pains for the rest of the day. I won’t let myself eat anything until the afternoon, and when I finally do eat, I hate myself for it. I have this scale I bought at the beginning of my weight loss which automatically syncs to an app, and I’ve become obsessed with it’s downward slope.

Here I am as another Sunday rolls around. It's kinda hard to understand that I've been in this centre for just over a week now. I came in here under a huge amount of distress, having been admitted to A&amp;E the day before for suicidal ideation and hyper anxiety due to the lack of access to the support I've needed for months.

I truly don't know where the last week went; I can't remember much of it. I've learnt that loss of short term memory is part of what happens when the body goes through trauma and shuts down non-necessary functions in order to survive. Without knowing it my brain has turned into cave man mode. The science behind all of this is incredible.

It's been a really tough week; lots of deep therapy dives into my brain, while being under some heavy doses of meds to keep me from going crazy. And as a 36yr old male, living in a house of women is a bit difficult too. I'm sure you can imagine why (and I honestly don't mean that in any sexist way). It's a difficult thing to accept that the eating disorder part of my issues is so stigmatised and even more so when you are an older male.

So here's where I get to my little win for the week. One of the girls here is 18; a big age difference mentally and in maturity between us. During a group therapy session we were asked to deliver positive affirmations to each other. She told me in very simple terms that ""I was kicking stigma in the stones"". That has stuck with me. It has given me hope that she could see that in me.

This week I will be focussing on beginning to learn more about the deeper causes of all this. It will be difficult. It's likely it will bring up things I've hidden or run from, or simply didn't realise.

Please keep me in your thoughts, and send positive vibes if/when you can. I really do appreciate it, and come back to these messages very often.

I'm an ftm guy, who struggled with anorexia like 4 ish years ago? I didn't ever get hospitalized but I did lose a significant amount of weight. Most of it has been gained back, as I've been on an uphill recovery climb after a couple years of struggling. However the thoughts of losing that much weight again never really go away. 

I've recently started Hrt and have been wanting to gain muscle, and get in shape in a healthy way. It's been hard though, since every time I start to get on track with my eating and exercise, the thoughts of ""What if i did this and wasnt healthy about it"" start to come back and I basically have to take a step back and stop so I don't start starving myself again. The side of my brain that never really recovered from my ED cant seem to comprehend that I have to gain weight to gain muscle.

I've been in my recovery process for about 4 months. My history with anorexia has been tough and every time I attempt to recover it was because of bodybuilders. I loved the way they looked. I wanted to be strong. This time around my relationship with food is much better. I lift weights and I've gained a good amount of muscle mass. I eat a caloric surplus and most days I'm ok. I decided to watch the movie 'to the bone' today and I really come to realize that those thoughts are always on the back of my mind. I always have them there but the only thing I love more then this sickness is being strong and when I can't workout, or eat the healthy foods I want I start remembering all of it. I still feel guilty for skipping workouts. From on obsession to another. I hate that sometimes I miss being hungry, or playing the ""how long can I go without food"" game. I like the way it feels to wrap my hands around my legs and be able to touch my fingers together. It never fucking gets out of my head.

So I've had a bad  relationship with food for about 10 years now, but never really got diagnosed with an ED by a professional. I just know that I am very unhealthy when it comes to food and eating. I'm trying to see a therapist this years aswell, but that takes time since they don't have any free slots for new patients atm. 

So.. I don't know when that first happened, but I just can't deal with people who'te dieting, talks  about calories and stuff like that. Why? I don't know. Because I am afraid that they'll slip into an ED? Because I am afraid i'm not the skinniest anymore cause that's all I have and that's what defines me? Because I feel bad cause I am not 'starving' myself atm and trying to be healthy while they are allowed to do that? I really don't know. I just know that it really bugs me.

My brother is overweight and I think he's on a diet now, which is good cause his weight is unhealthy. He didn't tell me about his diet, but I noticed healthier food in the house and he doesn't sewm to eat much tbh. He also weighs himself everyday. I also have to say that he is depressed so... I don't know. 

All I can think about is him losing weight and what a failure I am. I KNOW that he has to lose weight to be healthy, but it scares me that he's weighing hinself everyday and that he doesn't seem to eat. I can't talk to him about that; I've tried but we just don't get along and rarely talk to begin with.

What can I do? Am I a bad person?


Tldr:

I was reclusive and spent all day sleeping and binging at night. I decided I would lose the weight by doing keto and keeping fit, I achieved my goal and from there my eating disorder started I would track my calories everyday and if I went over I would just puke up just enough for me to assume I’m on my daily calorie intake.

This past year I went through a stressful period and developed IBD ( still awaiting  for diagnosis had my blood test) maintaining this routine has been a nightmare. 6 weeks ago I noticed I had gained over 15 pounds in just few weeks of not tracking calories. I decided to restrict myself to 1900 calories, and would just snack throughout the day and eat a meal before bed. I’ve realised I overestimate my meals so that number is inaccurate I was probably consuming 1500-1700 a day. My digestive problems during this period improved and I was also losing weight. Few days ago I realised I started experiencing dizziness and feeling cold all the time pain in my bones. I checked the scale and in 6 weeks I lost 33 pounds. I look anorexic and I went into panic mode and decided I would start eating again.

I’m currently on day 4 of eating normally again, first day I consumed 2300 then 3500 second day,  4200  third day and today I only consumed 2200. I’m concerned after reading online about refeeding syndrome and how it’s fatal would I be at risk? During the last 6 weeks I had cheat days where I consumed over 3000-4000 calories (birthday meal family gathering and holidays) I know my situation isn’t as extreme I didn’t eat less than a 1000 regularly, It’s been 4 days since I’ve been eating normal and I’m having a panic attack that I may be at risk

I never really struggled with anorexia until a few months ago, when it came completely out of the blue. (I've been a steady 115 lbs, give or take a few depending on whether I've eaten recently or not and all that stuff, since I was 14. I'm 19 now and my weight did not change, so I don't know what could have possibly triggered anorexia. I also don't know if it's actually anorexia, I haven't been diagnosed or anything.) My weight didn't change, but I knew I had a problem when I nearly collapsed and threw up stomach acid in the trash can at work due to hunger. I downloaded a health app to start tracking my calories, and found that I was eating about ~700 calories a day, and my recommended intake was ~1800. Over the past week or two I've been keeping my calories at the recommended level. It's hard, but doable. The problem is that over that time, I have rapidly lost weight rather than gaining it. I dropped to 110, then 106, and this morning I was down to the lower ranges of 105. I'm really scared. Shouldn't I be gaining weight? Why have I lost 10 pounds in less than two weeks if I've increased my eating? Is this a normal part of getting over anorexia or am I sick? Do I have some kind of parasite??

Lately the past year since losing my brother to gang kidnapping and murder, I've been unmotivated to eat and take care myself. Currently I don't like the living situation I'm in, I get extremely irritated daily with everyone, I view the poeple in my town as rude overweight savages who only want to see others in pain. Before he passed, I was focused on bulking, skateboarding, and didn't really have any negativity in my life. Currently I have to force my self to get up and cook, my normal appetite is gone and I have gotten used to having an empty stomach daily. I want to get better but theres many things that get me so angry on a daily basis, I lost the motivation to care for myself and be positive. It is a factor of lots of things including losing my brother, I live by myself  and don't have anyone to rely on. I know its seems I need to vent to poeple about my situation and chat with a therapist but I lost hope in humanity and being positive.

I’m currently a senior in High school and I want to try out for basketball. A little backstory: I have had a restrictive type eating disorder (I don’t really want to call it anorexia, because I weigh 266lb at 5’7 so I’m not underweight) and I’ve had a rough past few years. I developed my eating disorder over a year ago, and I originally was at 304lb. I dropped down to 230 and then I was put into treatment. Now I’m at 266. I am struggling with the weight gain during treatment and I am very self conscious. Anyways, I told my dad that I wanted to try out, and he said “I mean you can try...” in a very unenthusiastic way. I asked him if he thinks I would make the team and he said “well you might. But you have to get in shape.” This has fucked me up pretty bad. I’ve already started to relapse on the first week of school, and here’s my dad (who knows I have an eating disorder) telling me that I’m out of shape and probably wouldn’t make the basketball team. I am tempted to go into a full on relapse just to prove that I can lose the weight, and that I didn’t just randomly gain 36lb. I feel ashamed and put down by what he said, and I no longer want to try out because I feel like no matter how good I am at basketball, they won’t accept me because I’m fat and I look unappealing. I also wanted to try out for volleyball, but that’s a whole other beast.

1423,livipup,1565973316,cr8uz4,"I don't have a diagnosis yet and whatever is wrong with me was more likely than not caused by restricting, but basically eating food is painful for me and my body often doesn't even process food properly which leaves me feeling tired no matter how much I eat. The more I eat the more pain I end up in and the less likely I am to actually absorb whatever food I consumed. I was pretty dedicated to getting back to a healthy weight earlier this year because I thought that I would feel better after, but it was really hard. I tried doing it very quickly at first by eating tons of calorie dense food and then I didn't gain anything. Eating slightly above maintenance worked for me and I eventually did gain the weight I wanted to. Unfortunately that didn't actually help me feel better and it was still enough food to cause pain. I was wondering if this is a common experience. At least something similar if not the exact same.

I've been kind of struggling with eating again since maintaining a healthy weight didn't fix my problems. I feel like it's way too easy to restrict now since I have a valid excuse to not eat as much. The AN mindset is kind of setting in again though which really sucks because I had other reasons to want to be at a healthy weight again, but they're not exactly present reasons. I feel really bad that I want to lose weight again. When I first started struggling with anorexia my goal weight was around where I am now which is barely underweight for someone of my height, but I didn't even know that it was underweight then. Now I just feel worse and I kind of want to go lower than I was when I decided to start working toward getting better. The only reason I decided to recover was because I hit my second goal weight and then immediately wanted to lose more which scared me because it made me realize I would just be stuck in a cycle if I never stopped. I was borderline ""severely thin"" then. Now I kind of have an excuse to keep going and I'm not really sure what to do. Some days I still feel like I should try to eat more to be healthy, but then I just get sick.

Anyways, I used to be anorexic. I made my family absolutely miserable. We had to go to the doctor all the time... it was awful. I had lost a lot of weight, to the point where gaining weight was almost impossible. I even tried to gain a bit since I felt very guilty for not eating... When I went to the doctor I wasn’t gaining ANY weight (in fact I was losing) despite all my efforts. So... I made something up. I would binge eat the day before going to gain weight (it was hard). After that my body would “naturally” lose the weight. I still felt awful about my body (still do) but I did it for my family.

I did that for a while until we stopped seeing the doctor.I got stuck on this habit of binge eating. It’s summer too, so I basically gained ALL of me weight back! Then, I managed to lose some.

In the last week I have basically halved the amount I am eating and now it is very low. I'm surprised I haven't fainted yet. I almost did at a train station yesterday which scared me. I care about macros more than I did a week ago, but primarily I care about the number. I'm scared to eat more today than yesterday but I need to because otherwise how much longer until I'm just fasting? I don't want to fast, I need to eat to drive, I need to eat to study, I need to eat to do my job.

The thing that is scaring me is how quickly this has happened. I don't want to completely fix it. I want to keep my intake lower, lose weight, I'm fine with things being worse. But not this much worse. I already have lost control though. I already don't know how to get myself to eat more. I already don't know how to increase my intake even to a safe-low amount. I can't do it. It's only been a week. 

This is all that is in my head. I can't study because I am being consumed by these thoughts, what I can eat later. I told myself I needed to eat at least half a small meal before work yesterday (I teach uni students and don't want to let them down with their education) but I couldn't even do that. I was so dizzy and weak but I got through, and I feel like it was luck. I've been here before. 

In the past when I was here, in this space, I ended up fasting. And I ended up medically unstable. And I ended up in hospital with an NG tube which was traumatic. Or I ended up in voluntary hospitals to avoid that. I can't do that again. It will ruin everything. Yesterday, I told myself I just needed to hit 600 calories. That was a start, all I needed to do. I'd done a lot of exercise. It was okay. But I couldn't even make it to that.

The food I treated myself too only didn’t make me feel so guilty because I was going the full day hardly eating anything else without realizing it because of my busy schedule.

Now I’ve decided I want to work on getting really strong and muscular after being inspired by some fitness bloggers who recovered from their eating disorders. I then discovered that fat gain is a part of becoming that muscular, and you sometimes have to gain fat in places you don’t want it to know how you have to change your diet and exercise. Then you work on getting rid of that fat and hope you won’t have fat go somewhere else you don’t want it after. What. The. Fuck. 

That sent me into a downward fucking spiral. I’m going to put this much effort into something that could make me hate my body again???? That’s how it hit me that I’m not fucking recovered. I can’t psychologically cope with fat gain. At least by not stepping on the scale I can ignore my numbers but I’ll notice fucking fat gain. I hate myself. This is apparently a normal and healthy way to become fit and muscular, why am I reacting this way to it????

So I have an ED and I think it got worse after I developed severe PTSD. My abuser was/is very obese. That influenced my ED greatly I feel like. A solid amount of my ED stems around the idea of being the complete opposite of him as much as possible. My biggest fear is being even slightly like him so I don’t eat and when I do most of the time I will purge it. I was recovering and after I left the treatment facility I gained weight rapidly from binging and I’ve relapsed pretty badly into my old habits because I saw my weight go up about 100 lbs more than when I started treatment. I wish I were joking when I say I gained 100 lbs but it sadly is true. I’ve now lost almost 30 lbs since two or three months ago and I keep seeing the weight shed off but I still feel like being at my weight makes me closer to him and it terrifies me because I would never want to be like him at all or hurt anyone like he hurt me and i feel like if I do become the size he is I’ll be like him. I’m just so so so scared I might be anything like him at all. I dress the opposite of how he would dress i made my hair as different as possible to not have the same hair I had then or the same hair as him. I don’t wear the clothes I used to because if both weight and even seeing them causes great flashbacks. So I feel like my PTSD really influences my eating disorder greatly causing me to avoid eating as much as possible and only consuming calories when needed from liquids as to never gain food weight. None of my friends or family know I’m relapsing and I don’t want to tell them and worry them so I’ve kept up my recovery blog but it’s full of lies.

but I do know it’s worse then ever. &amp; I know it will always progress &amp; get worse &amp; worse. But I still see fat. Food still makes me ill.

I begin thinking of ways I can compensate, like ""maybe tomorrow I won't eat as much to make up for today"", or ""maybe I will exercise more to burn all of the calories I just ate"". I start to hate myself and feel like a terrible person just for eating normally and it starts this cycle of self loathing of feeling fat. I don't overeat at all. Which is why I am so confused over the guilt.

I LOVE food, but recently I've been scared of eating because I hate feeling bad afterwards. I have a therapist who I love, and I go to DBT every week, but I'm scared to bring it up with my therapist. I'm the happiest I have been in years. I just started a job I love, and I'm finally making plans. I just don't want my therapist to think ""oh, there is ALWAYS something wrong going on."" I really am doing good, I'm just trying to understand this guilt I am feeling, and the compulsive need to not eat or exercise to avoid that feeling. 

I was just wondering if anyone had any insight.",Guilt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/cvlzqz/guilt/,1566835419.0,2019-08-26 05:03:39

(Posted with mod approval).

I'm writing an article for the Guardian newspaper which is about people who live without mirrors in their houses - perhaps because they have BDD, are in recovery for an eating disorder, or have other anxiety disorders. 

I'm looking to speak with UK based case studies predominantly about what this is like: whether it is beneficial or damaging for your mental health, and what the consequences may be for your interpersonal relationships. 

Happy to provide evidence of my press credentials (if you'd like to Google me, my name is Sirin Kale.) I have form in reporting sensitive issues in an educational and compassionate way, without sensationalism.

1463,RexieEllen,1566796680,cvjowi,"Where there early signs? Behaviors that predicted a future toxic relationship with food? Is it a genetic predisposition? Can I blame someone? Is it a coping mechanism to try to control the anxiety? My mom has bpd and bipolar as well as OCD...she was/is very emotionally and physically abusive. Maybe my traumatic childhood caused this. Is the ED just a side effect from the abuse? 

My sister and mom would call me ""gentle giant"" because I used to be in fencing, gymnastics, and rock climbing (sports that bulked up my muscles). Have you guys seen That Regular Show? Do you know who Muscle Man is? They would call me Muscle Man. One time, I was sitting on the floor, in a child's pose, doing my homework and my sister for no reason at all came up behind me and picked me up by my love handles--side fat. It hurt so bad. 

My dad used to make \*moo\*-ing noises overtime I opened the fridge and would give me shit for eating whatever I wanted. Ironically he still gives me shit butt now for not eating anything. I'm never going to be enough. I'm nothing so I should eat nothing... it never really is enough. I get perfect grades...straight A's, full IB, honor roll, but it's still not enough. I'm still a disappointment. My mom has told me to kill myself and that I'm a fucking waste of space and someonelses resources. If I kill myself make sure I actually do i because attempts are for attention seekers is what she tells me. 

My aunt who is a Dr is anorexic. She said if you want to lose weight just shut your mouth. Over the summer of Jr year of high school (three years ago), before my ED, she would tell me things like I was fat. She and her husband are divorced and saying it was toxic relationship is an understatement. Apparently, she had found his porn stash and she was mad that she didn't do it for him... When she was explaining it she said that he had a DVD of cheerleaders, young girls like me, on it doing inappropriate sexual things. My cousin screams ""Ewww no! NOT LIKE HER!! She's fat!!"" and just started laughing hysterically. His mom started laughing too and was like ""I meant not like her but I meant around the same age. Girls who are skinnier."" They bullied me the entire summer and the next one as well. I thought it didn't get to me...at one point it was like a middle finger to them both like I'll show you...the next time you see me I'll be a toothpick...and then the next summer I'll be dead and its your fault! 

Is it because of my ADHD? I take 54mg of Ritalin which is the highest dosage. I've always been on it though since elementary school and haven't had a real problem. I did have problems eating in front of people but that was an anxiety thing and fear of judgement. I also just found chewing to be gross and the sounds of it. I think chewing is gross and I judge people when they eat so I just assumed people thought I was gross too when I atet so I never ate at school, but I would still eat. I just waited till I got home to eat lunch. I remember being hungry, I remember what it was like to feel satisfied after a meal and liking and enjoying the taste of food was like, I used to be adventurous with food, and it excited me, but now I just hate food and trying new things. When I do eat I just hate it...I get nothing out of it, nothing from it. I'm going through the motions of eating, but not experiencing it. To me, food is like if I was chewing on cardboard for a couple hours, just pointless and meh. Doesn't taste bad but its not good. I over work out because I need to be constantly stimulated and my serotonin levels are so low that when I do run for like 14miles on empty it gives me this serotonin high. That has messed me up so much though, because the only true happiness I get (besides cuddling my puppies) is from starving and over exerting. Can my indifference and lack of feeling be due to my depression? I'm on prozac now which has helped with suicide but it hasn't made me any happier. 

I don't know who I am. The more I keep trying to dive for answers the more I keep getting lost. My therapist keeps opening old scars and replaying horrific child hood traumas.  I'm trying to forgive my mom and dad and myself as well but I'm finding it difficult when I have to see and live with my abusers every day. It's like being in cycle of beginning to  heal but just as I'm feeling mildly better I get triggered again and again and again. If I had dealt with my emotions earlier...instead of surprising them because I was raised in an environment where feelings and emotions weren't allows to be expressed. Home wasn't a safe place. If I had actually admitted to the abuse and tried to talk about all these suppressed emotions and memories...would I still have an ED? The more I try to get better...the more mental health similarities I'm finding with my mom. My ultimate fear that I've always had was being like my mom--a monster, being out of control of my actions due to chemical imbalances. Maybe this is who I am and its in my genetics to be fucked up. Maybe its inevitable. 

My grandma whom I was very close to died of acute leukemia. I found out my senior year of high school and thats when my ED kicked into overdrive. I didn't feel a sense of lose...just that I had to burn off cals. I hated myself even more because here I was burning negative cals at the gym when my grandma was in agony. I never got to say goodbye. She died two months after we found out. I had the chance to call her while she was in the hospital but I couldn't bring myself to do it. The day she died was when I was at my ex boyfriends house trying to lose my virginity. Did I cause her death? Because I wasn't praying for her instead I was trying to get fucked? I still can't believe she's gone and when I was at my lowest...I was forced to recover. Without my coping mechanism...without that something to obsess on..I was forced to feel and I can't feel I don't want to feel. I need to be empty! I need to be numb and to feel nothing or I will feel everything--all the emotions I've held back all at once. 

Does it really get better?

1467,RexieEllen,1566792655,cvj25r,"For the past few months I've been faking recovery. Reporting what I eat on a sheet to my parents, one that does not have cals or nutrition facts but is purely for accountability and making sure I'm eating three times a day. I naturally bull shit everything on it and I keep a secret log of my actual intake. 

My parents have been getting really emotionally dicy. Somedays they will try to be understanding and sensitive, but most days they victim blame me and blame my ED on why our family is so dysfunctional. This particular incident, my Dr yelled at my dad for being a prick and so he felt guilt about it i guess. So we went on a spontaneous three day vacation to California. I dictated the destinations and what we were going to do. I was indifferent about the whole thing so they suggested Six Flags because once upon a time, a whole ED light yr ago, that place made me ""happy."" The whole trip was a wash. I knew going into it that I was going to get shit for not eating...I tried to tell my mom that I didn't want to go because dad was going to be rude and insensitive/triggering but to no avail. 

Long story short, he found my journal and was upset. Especially since I was logging in an average of 0-96cals a day. He yelled at me how like I need to eat more and what I'm eating is't enough and I had to explain like to him that it's not a lot for him but to me a person with an ED it is very hard and a lot of food for me. I'm at least trying. He's like you're not even eating enough to maintain, at this rate your weight will keep going down and down. I'm not a grown man in my 40's I don't need to eat 2,000+ cals a day like chill. Plus he's not my Dr. he's not my nutritionist like he needs to stop forcing me to eat and triggering me. 

Sometime I will order like a salad and he pressures me to order something else with it because its ""not enough."" Or I get an appetizer and he's demands I get a normal portion as if I'm not just going ""save it for later."" 

Anyways, on the trip, he convinced me to try this Vegan and gluten free dessert place. I let him get inside my head. I ate a bite size vanilla bean cupcake with pink frosting, 1/5th of a matcha chocolate square, and 1/3 of a cashew caramel bar....there weren't any nutrition facts for it anywhere....and I was pisssssed, beyond livid. 

This quickly escalates around dinner time. This meltdown thats mentioned from the title of this post happened towards the end of our trip and I was so mad that I didn't want to get crab legs anymore. I was screaming I'm not hungry I'll just eat at the airport or whatever. When we got there I  ordered veggie rolls at this asian place thinking it was a spring roll--nope. It was an egg roll covered in grease like I mean more grease than pizza...the grease was legitimately soaking through the . box. I flipped out and refused to eat it and . so I opted for a salad that basically had spinach, iceberg, red . quinoa, tomatoes, and black olives....I started hyper ventilating because my dad made me eat all of it. It was prepackaged and so I thought there was nutrition on facts on the bottom of the container but there were not. I made my dad help me look up salads that were close in calories and he was getting hella annoyed. 

He found this one salad that had parmesan cheese added to the cals as well as croutons and dressing which upped the values, but a this point its been hours so I'm like whatever its fine. Then my dad is like no its not fine, this is a gross overestimate of what you ate and it wouldn't be accurate. Then I flipped out and went nutzo. I snapped. I was like this entire journal is inaccurate because of you! For the past three days I've been estimating because I just don't know! I don't know how much cals I've eaten or carbs are anything! I don't know anything! I only eat foods that I definitely know the caloric values of.

He told me to calm down as if I was causing a scene...as if I was just being another hysterical woman and that he can slap me down into submission. 

Then he told me that i cant expect . everyone to cater to me and blah blah and how I shouldn't let this prevent me from living and eating what I want and blah about how even though I don't know the exact cal amount I can find a pretty close food item that is similar. But like....if I don't track cals  i can't have accountability. I can't track in my head...visually three potatoes seems not that much and sounds heavenly but if I sat down and wrote out the carbs in it and all the cals...its bad bad news.

She got really close to my face, started stroking my hair, and whispered ""I could eat you as a snack.""

I'm like...""ohhh hunny, that's why you're so god damn round, because your portion sizes are off. By the looks of it you ate an entire football team, including the water boy, and still continued to call it a 'snack' so you also gorged on the cheerleaders. It's called a cheat day not a cheat year."" 

Naturally she tried to deck me, but was too slow and fell over. I felt bad, but I mean its the truth. If no one tells her the truth she will only get bigger and sicker. I'm not trying to fat shame and I'm all for body positivity, but I mean theres an extent...if you're morbidly obese you need to just stop it. Ik ik its hypocritical, because one could say why don't you just eat then its not that hard. Just stop it. But I'm coming from the ana side and I don't see how you can allow yourself to get that huge. 

She demanded to speak to my manager. I thought I was for sure fired, but my manager said that the lady said that even though I was belligerent and disregarded social mannerisms/customer-sales associate rapport that I was the only one who was brutally honest with her. She said that I motivated her to be the best version of herself and that I gave her more encouragement than her actual nutritionist. She wanted my manager to give me a raise....she didn't but I didn't get in trouble either. 

I honestly wasn't trying to bully her...I just thought the first comment was funny and I have issues with filtering and social cues. But I know the other comments were to be mean...and I know I crossed the line, but you should have seen how triggering she looked like god damn. 

Was I in the wrong, because she wasn't asking for it or just in general because she's a paying customer and theres a time and place for everything? I told my sister about the altercation and she was in disbelief...she was like ""you can't say that, but you can think it."" I'm like why? Why do I have to filter anything...if I see something thats life threatening and dangerous I should step in right? If you saw a mother beating her child or someone left their dog in the car, you'd step in even though you don't know this person--its the right thing to do. Wasn't I being altruistic by telling her the truth?

1484,x24throwaway,1566632700,cuqjyy,"I posted here earlier this week, unsure and conflicted about whether I was really relapsing or not. I have since seen a therapist and... been diagnosed again. 

It feels like since hearing this, things are escalating quickly. I'm trying to keep them stable but it's getting so much more challenging so quickly and I don't know how much longer I can keep it like this. It's like since hearing the diagnosis, since other people are overtly aware now not just me, I don't need to maintain things. Almost like I have permission to, or even should, allow things to get worse. 

So quickly, it has gotten more difficult to eat. A few days ago I was able to be eating the same amount each day but since this therapy session, I feel like I'm competing with myself and every day should be less calories. I feel even larger than I did before, too fat for this to be real. A few days ago, I was able to push the obsessive thoughts aside long enough to get some studying done. Now, I can't manage that even. 

I asked my therapist if this will ever go away, if I'll ever really get better. She thinks it's unlikely, but that the symptoms can be managed. I guess deep down this is what I always believed, that I'd never really recover - I was shocked when I thought I somehow had recovered previously - but it's been a little confronting to hear it from a professional.

I don't know what to do. I don't know yet if I even want to do anything. I don't know what the point of this was. I guess just, does anyone have any words?

1486,georgedies,1566610574,cun6ds,"Please help me.



I have recovered from my eating disorder for 6 years already. But a few months ago I looked up the long term effects of an eating disorder and found that if you have it at a young Age you can become “sexually underdeveloped”. This thought immediately stressed me out as I had an eating disorder at 11 (I am a boy)...


So I had an eating disorder at 11. I ate very minimal amounts of food, sometimes only 3 pieces of Bread, an Apple and a small meal a day. At the worst point I weighed 30 kg while being 157 cm tall. The disorder lasted 3 months until my I got help and started to eat healthy and normal amounts of food again. I physically recovered in a few months. 


Now (6 years later), everything is basically fine. I have grown to the height the school doctor told me I would become before I had the disorder (190 cm) and I weigh 75 kg. And I physically feel healthy.



So basically everything seems fine, but the “sexually underdeveloped” issue still bothers me. I feel like my sex drive is fine, but what if it was permanently damaged by the eating disorder and it could have been higher? Could this be true?


I asked this on reddit a few months ago and people told me it wasnt possible. But then I started having these thoughts about the permanently damaged sex drive again and asked it again on reddit. This happened like 7 times at least and everybody has told me it wasnt possible. I asked on r/sex, where 2 people said I am fine, on r/askdocs someone said it was “unlikely”, on r/edanonymous where someone said it was in absolutely No way possible, and in this sub people also told me it isnt possible (I might be forgetting other subs).


So yesterday I was having these thoughts again and Made a final post asking the question on r/fuckeatingdisorders. I thought, after this I Will accept it because so many people told me it isnt possible. But someone replied that it is certainly possible, and it is REALLY stressing me out. 


Its almost 4 am right now and I just want to know from someone who knows a lot about this, is it possible or not? Be completely honest please. 

Then I can finally delete this app off my phone forever.


Thanks so much if you read all this and please help me

1487,LucasW76,1567738273,d0aua8,"This year has been hard on me. During May I started getting panic attacks. That was my first wave of panic attacks. This has been going on for the past 2 months. Then in June, I started to not really care about my grades and more focus on trying to fix myself as a person. This was middle school was getting ready for high school. Choosing my classes taking some tough ones and some classes my parents wanted me to do then after I finished I went off to camp. Never got homesick which I am happy for, but did miss out on some key event that made me upset like my sister visiting her college or her deciding which college. I also missed another key event (I forgot what it was). On top of that in camp with a bunch of people, I started getting Panic Attacks again (Yes this is a lot about panic attacks but this will lead up to why I am posting here) This was my second wave of Attacks. This one wouldn't have been as bad If I wasn't trying to hide it. This made it worse but had to make sure no one knew because I would have been embarrassed. Now we come to today and I started getting a Panic Attacks the past 3 days. While this was happening in my life again I also developed unusual eating habits that I never have done in my life and I don't think it's healthy. Normally I would have 2-3 muffins/cupcakes now I might just have 1 or even none (Maybe Have a Yogurt. During lunch, I used to eat salads, sandwiches, and pizza now I only eat Yogurt or Chips. I do eat dinner like I would eat lunch if I had a normal eating habit, but I've learned that when eating Dinner it should be enough to last you for 8-9 hours for sleep. I only sleep for 4 hours so I can feel my stomach asking for food. I feel like my life is being controlled by mental illnesses that I never thought would happen to me. Panic Attacks keep me up at night and my new/(bad?) ED is making me suffer. If someone could please tell me if this is normal or if this is bad. If you made it to the end thanks for hearing me out I just realized that this has been a problem (maybe) so I found this and typed it up. I also want to mention that my mom wants me to eat and I keep telling her I'm not hungry because that is true I never am hungry when she says you gotta eat something, but in school, I feel my stomach burning. This really feels weird. I am just experiencing these things and just want answers to some things I have to ask:

1506,roseec,1567588432,cziea1,"I’ve been struggling with the binge eat, gain weight, then starve and lose it all cycle for years and years. I starve and become too thin and people worry, and then suddenly I spend one night binging and it’s all I do for the next 3 weeks, or months. I don’t understand how no one has noticed this cycle of me being thin and then a little chubby over and over. My eating habits have been severely disordered since I was 14, I am almost 21 now. When I was 13 I was put into a residential treatment center for a year which is where my disorder really developed. I don’t think the staff there were fully equipped to know how to deal with this and it just got worse when I left. There response was just to force me to eat 100% of every meal and they were often very large. I heavily abused laxatives from 15-16, was always a little underweight as a teen and the past 2 years have just been an endless cycle of binge then starve. I feel so lost in this, I’ll binge and binge until my stomach literally looks 6 months pregnant and I cannot move. I don’t know how to reach out and let people know this is bigger than it may appear. I’m suffering so much and I know my body is too, constantly going from one extreme to the other. I also deal with Irritable bowel syndrome so when I force my body to take in mass amounts of foods it doesn’t like I become very sick, but that doesn’t stop me. 

I’ve also had two serious boyfriends who also dealt with eating disorders(bulimia) and I can’t imagine that has helped me.  I never feel happy with my body either way. I finally told my mom a few months ago how bad this was when I had lost a large amount of weight after a painful breakup, and I’m on a waitlist at a treatment facility for outpatient therapy, but I don’t know if I can wait. I’ve since gained the weight back and probably plus some. I’m currently in the binge part of the cycle but I know soon I’ll break down and the starving will return.

1509,myteetharescreaming,1567539548,cz9pi6,I’ve been ashamed of showing my body of and on my entire life. It’s been seven years since I’ve been shirtless around anyone. I truly love swimming it’s always been a passion of mine. I haven’t swam in seven years. It got so bad that even wearing a rash guard to the pool wasn’t enough. The thought of the rash guard briefly riding up and exposing any part of me frightened me so acutely that I simply never did it again. Every time I look in the mirror I it causes me  such emotional trauma that it almost hurts physically. I hate my body so much the only time I take my shirt off is the shower and it’s the worst. I’m 6 foot tall guy and I’m 10 pounds away from my goal weight 140. The worst part about it is I know i’ll still be miserable when I get to it. I actually don’t know how much weight I would have to lose to be actually happy. I know I’d be drastically underweight before I could  even look at the person in the mirror let alone be happy and I’ve given given up even romancing the idea of ever viewing myself as being handsome. Recently I met a girl online I could tell she was really into me. The first time I took my shirt off in front of her I immediately put her hands and the places I knew it would hurt the most for her to touch. She laughed when I told her how bad it made me feel. She pinched the area I felt most vulnerable and said it was just skin. I knew in my head technically she was wrong that there was in fat that there. I viewed what she said as lie but I desperately wanted to believe it. for a long time after that I still felt God awful having my shirt off around her. It still hurts so much to look down. It felt even worse when I felt my skin roll up in touch. The times I was shirtless with her I accidentally looked down a several times I saw what I call my fat sag bunch up it was sickening and it hurt me every time. I got to the point where I was ok around her shirtless but only while standing. I was still uncomfortable but I could manage it. Leaning over is still too much to bear. Specialty looking down in a compromised position. One day I was undressing for a shower and after I did I realized I’d left something in the other room. So I got dressed but as I was holding my shirt in my hands I had a lazy hesitation pausing I think if I really cared enough to get what was in the other room. I decided I needed to get it In that time I flirted with the idea going out shirtless and  not putting the shirt over my head. I did it I walked through my house got what I needed without being seen. Strangely I was very disappointed no one saw. I walking back my grandma saw me she spoke to me and stopped to talk to her. I was happy and felt lucky that someone had noticed me shirtless it made me feel excited. I realized just how powerful being shirtless around people makes me feel. Mockingly crushing my greatest fear almost made me feel godly. I wish it was more normal to be shirtless in public. I’m by no means athletically built but I recognize now that I’m attractive even if my current weight.

It was really upsetting for me to realize, and some ED behaviors became triggered as a result. With my therapist's help I was able to sort of stay on the recovery track anyway, by making sure to eat regularly. However, I started counting calories and have begun to lose quite a lot of weight. I'm still at a very healthy weight and I am eating my meals. It's just that I'm worried that this could go beyond just a little weight loss. My plan is to reach only a certain weight that is well within the healthy range and maintain there by using calorie counting. Counting (in my mind) will help me to both lose and maintain my weight because I can be more aware of if I'm eating enough or too little.

Do you think this is a relapse? Or, is it possible to lose some weight in recovery and then maintain that healthy weight?

I realize that engaging in dieting behavior is basically relapsing, but if my plan is to only get to a certain number and stay there is it really a relapse?

I started to get help for a completely different psychological disorder (GAD) and I just realized that now with my pills...I feel happier, I feel calmer, I feel better altogether. I didn't even notice the changed view of my Body at first. Yesterday I felt Beautiful for the first time in 6 years. I am able to eat with way less guilt. I am so close to fully heal.

So just to be like all These inspirational dudes and dudines: No matter how badly sick you are. No matter how many disorders you suffer from. It can get better. For everyone. I truly believe that.

I know that it doesn't feel like there's any Chance of healing at all, sometimes. Not even in the slightest.

I felt so depressed as my anxiety got worse and as it got worse so did my ED...but I got help. 

I know that I still have a lot of work to do on my GAD, but loosing my sucky relationship with my Body in Exchange for self love and self respect is one step towards my Dream of Living as a mentally stable Citizen.

I was in the hospital for three and a half months and was sent home in February and I continued restricting until July of the same year. 

Then I managed to recover on my own, because life was going semi-well I have had thought about relapsing for the entire time of recovery but I never acted upon them because again there was little to no need to take control, I already had it. That changed this month I suppose, my life now revolves around my sick grandparents, circling around grandma in the hospital with a shattered foot and senile grandpa at home, I also had to get a job because our family income is pretty low and outcome high because of this situation.

Tonight I decided to have some time to myself. My son is napping, the dog is in the other room on her bed, and I am in the tub. I dropped my phone in the tub. That sucked. Now I’m stressed about that because there’s a crack and half the speakers don’t work. Also, because I’m now stuck staring at my naked body I have this overwhelming desire to hurt myself. Not like the usual self harm, I mean the not eat for a few days, go for two hour long walks every day until I’m happy with what I see. But that will never happen.

One time I went pretty much a whole week without eating (had an apple or slice of bread when I was forced to). I've never binged or even eaten to the point of discomfort, but I often feel guilty after eating and dissatisfied with my body.

Besides my energy drink, I have no craving for food. Ever. I’m just beginning to realize I may have an eating disorder but I don’t really know what to do. 

I only stopped eating after moving myself out of an abusive relationship/home. It was horrible.

I’m 34 and I first noticed about ten years ago when my ex husband left me that the despair of the situation made me completely lose my appetite. I also lost significant weight. I basically lived on slim fast shakes, kidney beans, carrots and blueberries. When I met my current husband he would insist I eat more and made kind of a big deal about it. And I did get a lot better, I would say to the point that I had no issues eating at all and actually started to love cooking and eating pretty much any and all things. Well about two years ago I began to accept that I was remembering repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse. I spoke out about it to my parents and brother in an effort to begin healing. My relationships with them have totally fallen apart, and I’ve discovered that my mother is a covert narcissist and has been psychologically manipulating and abusing me my whole life. This is devastating because pretty much since I was a teenager I’ve always considered my mom to be my best friend and now I have gone completely no contact to protect myself and my two daughters from more abuse. I am trying desperately to heal and learn how to cope with all of this trauma, am even finally seeing a psychologist(yay), but the eating issue is out of control. I hate food, I hate eating. Even the smell or thought of food makes me nauseous. I have to force myself to eat and it’s so sickening and upsetting. I am even beginning to hate consuming liquids as well which has been my one saving grace in a lot of ways. I know its psychosomatic, but honestly I don’t care about my weight or calories or anything like that, I mean I care but in a normal way or whatever, like I’m not obsessed about it. I also get most of my calories from alcohol, my preference is beer, but sometimes wine. I wouldn’t say that I abuse alcohol, but it’s a crutch for me. It helps me relax and feel good which nothing else really does and it also will sometimes help me to get a little bit of an appetite. But now that is waning as well. I don’t know what this issue is rooted in but it’s getting really bad and I’m struggling with it constantly. I am going to talk to my therapist about it at the next appointment, I honestly got so overwhelmed at my first one that I forgot to mention it.

Well—school just started again, and I am really right back at counting my calories, and restricting, and feeling uncomfortable if I’m not hungry. I am terrified of what I’m doing to my body, but I am TERRIFIED of gaining weight. I want to be skinny.

I don’t know what to do, because my therapist does not specialize in eating disorders, and I don’t know how to find someone that does without my parents finding out. 

Also—I feel really guilty because sometimes this almost feels like a choice. I knew if I let myself start restricting again I would become obsessed with it, but I almost wanted that to happen.

If you're seeking help good, if you're an active addict that doesn't realize they have a problem, I hate you. 

That being said, I couldn't help but to sit there and list all of the behaviors that are similar between ED and addiction. 

Every church in my county has postings for NA and AA meetings but I never see anything for ED. There are 4 halfway houses within a 10 mile radius for recovering addicts but there's no such place anywhere around here for ED. There are advertisements all over the place for help in this opioid epidemic we are facing but I see no adds for help with ED even though it's a massive issue. 

The typical self treatment options aren't helping me. Food journals are shit. Counting calories is shit. Eating more is a wish on a candle at this point. I need help and I can't find it yet pharmacies are offering free narcan to civilians to help someone if they see an overdose. Wheres my help when I faint from lack of nutrition? 

The behaviors are so similar. Lying, stealing, hiding, disassociating, passing out, etc. And they both can lead to terrible deaths but I don't see a plethora of churches reaching out begging anorexics to get help. 

On top of it all, insurance often will help pay for a 30 day rehab program for opioid addicts (big pharma loves to double tap) but insurance fights to cover therapy for ED. There are rehabs here and there for anorexia, they're called mental hospitals, and insurance fights it.

For the last 2 months, ever since I started working, I’ve been skipping lunch and only eating dinner. I’ve never really eaten breakfast because I wake up nauseous and can’t make myself eat. But, since no one really pays attention to me at work, I’ve been skipping. It feels like a waste to spend one hour eating when I could be working and go home an hour earlier. My co-worker started to get worried that I wasn’t leaving the office during working hours, so when she’s at her desk during lunch, I leave and take a walk around the block to pretend that I’m getting lunch. If she’s not there at lunch time, I just skip it. I started doing this because I’m paranoid about spending money on food, but it’s snowballed into something more. If I spend more than 10 dollars on food, I feel guilty and try to compensate the next day buy spending less or not eating. I feel proud when I manage to not have lunch because I’m spending less and not eating. I don’t know where this compulsive need to spend less comes from because I’m from a well off family, but I can’t help the guilt of spending money on food I see as non essencial. And if I can’t help not eating, I feel very guilty if I eat more than 9 oz of food. There’s a place close to work that has my favorite food, but it’s 11 dollars and everytime I go there I feel very guilty that I ate the whole plate and spent so much and hate the full feeling. I don’t have the courage to purge, so I’m stuck feeling miserable the whole afternoon. I don’t eat snacks either because it makes me feel very guilty as well. I only eat dinner because my mom makes dinner and I don’t want her to suspect that I’m not eating and I don’t have the heart to throwaway food.

My mom is also part of the problem. Recently, she’s been body shamming me by sending me photos of my past thinner self and of my current fat self and telling me how fat I’ve gotten. It always makes me feel more terrible and fast more. I’ve asked her to stop everytime, but whenever the topic shifts to clothes, she brings up the fact that I’m fat. My clothes still fit me ok, but I hate the fact that when I bend over, my stomach touches. I feel so disgusted when that happens that I need to readjust my position immediately. When I look in the mirror, I see back rolls and how fat I am and spiral into self hate. I still crave certain foods though and somedays I give in and feel very guilty and filled with shame afterwards. I’ve taken to chugging water to stave off the hunger, but am slowly getting used to the feeling. I miss being able to see my ribs when I sucked my tummy in. I also have a younger sister that has always been overweight and my mother keeps sending diets and exercise regiments to her in the family group chat and she’s been tagging me too recently and this just brings a whole new wave of shame and self hate. I don’t think she realises what she’s doing to me, but I also don’t know if she would stop if she knew because she’s been on a big fitness wave recently, like exercising a lot and eating very heathily. She’s given up on my sister losing weight and I think she’s turned her attentions towards me now and I’ve been feeling horrible ever since.

1687,beautifulchaos22,1569522174,d9nm07,"Okay, this is probably going get a world record for the dumbest post, but honestly, my brain is so fried that Gordon Ramsay would have a conniption.

So I had a consult for ED treatment yesterday and the psychiatrist was concerned about my frequency of symptoms and my low weight. 

&amp;#x200B;

I previously did day hospital treatment with another program (lol I hated that program, they told me I wasn't ""sick enough"" for inpatient). I finished the program and I did outpatient for a couple of months, but I'm back to my old shitty ways and I got discharged from outpatient because I was too symptomatic and I've relapsed (that's a whole other can of worms lol, but honestly I'm glad to be done with that program, I and everyone I know who did the program hated it).

&amp;#x200B;

The psychiatrist I did the consult with said that I need intensive treatment again, and mentioned day hospital in passing, but didn't really definitively say ""i'm going to refer you to day hospital"" VS ""I'm going to refer you to inpatient.""

&amp;#x200B;

I found out from my GP today that the consultation note the psychiatrist sent him said that I need intensive treatment, and she wants to start me with intensive day hospital ""at the very least"".

I have to discuss my treatment plan with my individual coordinator in the next week or two, but I just keep overthinking what the psychiatrist said: like does that mean she's considering inpatient or not? I know this could all be clarified if I contacted the program, but some weird part of me is afraid that they'll be like ""no you don't need inpatient, just day hospital"" . It's weird, I know.  I guess I'm afraid of not being ""sick enough"" again. But at the same time, inpatient is really hard and strict. I was inpatient for other mental health issues, and although its not the same, I get the gist. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have to have a further assessment with my treatment coordinator and a physician to (assess medical stability I guess) in the next couple of weeks, and I feel like the assessment with the treatment coordinator will involve discussion about if inpatient is feasible at this time (like my situation and can I commit to it etc). Day hospital wait time is 4-6 months at the moment, although I hear that inpatient is a shorter wait list. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience? I'm in Canada if that matters and the program I'll be doing is entirely publically funded, hence the wait times. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, does anyone know what the general weight restoration BMI is? I feel like I'll be on weight restoration given the psychiatrist's comment/concern about my weight, but I'm also not completely sure and that's giving me anxiety too.

&amp;#x200B;

If you got to the end of this very disorganized and rambly post, thank you for reading!

However I’ve never been big on eating breakfast as it was not commonplace growing up in my house. Since I was around 12, I’d also skip lunch or eat a cookie or something very small.

I’m 24 now, and I pretty much only ever eat dinner. Every now and then I’ll eat a banana or a granola bar in front of coworkers because two of them had mentioned that they had never seen me eat. (I’ve since gone out to dinner with them three times and ate as much as everyone else). 
I do have food rules. I’m vegetarian and I don’t eat things like bread, pasta or beans. My diet consists of a lot of vegetables and fruit, and sometimes fish. My go to meals are soup or a salad. However my dinners are usually anywhere between 600-900 calories so I don’t limit calorie intake too much. Needless to say that most days those are the only calories i ingest.

1707,WhosThatGirl143,1569332281,d8nbi2,"I’m curious because I’ve been to a couple of support groups and it’s interesting that everyone has a different story that you can trace. For me, I was always a very skinny tall kid - I was around 5’7 when I was 13/14, then overnight I seemed to develop a SUPER hourglass figure when puberty hit. I have a big chest and very wide hips. It seemed like overnight I went from a size 6 to a size 10/12. 

Unfortunately, it was the same time that my family broke down. My mum was struggling with her mental health and she ended up leaving, and I was left with my dad who didn’t really have a clue what was going on. There were a lot of huge arguments within the family and I was pretty much treated like an adult. I was just expected to deal with these huge emotional and financial issues and be involved in a messy divorce of two people having breakdowns. I remember having a feeling so strong that I just wanted someone to look after and be a kid again that didn’t have to worry. For me, I felt like because I LOOKED like an adult, I was treated like one. I turned to B&amp;P, which just made me gain. There was a time I put on a lot of weight and my mother, because of her mental health, made a few derogatory comments to me, and it kickstarted a whole unhealthy mindset that people would just LIKE me and want to look after me if I was small. 

Even though I still struggle today, i find it helpful to know that there is a reason behind how this started, and it makes it easier for me to process and understand how my mind works. I feel like I neglect myself because I want someone else to care for me, but when someone does try (ie by trying to make me eat), my brain panics and doesn’t know what to do, so I reject it again.

1710,Spring-345,1569289715,d8ghsp,"The answer is no. I’ve noticed a certain pattern with my eating disorder. It morphs into something else. I used to be anorexic. I made everyone worry sick. Now I’m at a “healthy weight” and all I want is to be underweight. I’ve created this awful habit of binging. I know I can break out of it if I try really hard, but I can’t explain how difficult it is. 

TW: Stupid ED thoughts and Numbers:
What really set me off was how much I miss my eating disorder. I want it back, yet I’m a bit scared for my family. I’ve been binging. My body WANTS to be at least 10 pounds heavier, I’ve lost my period again after having it back for about two days. I stayed over at a friend’s house about a month ago or so. I fasted for over a day there (which was my first time doing that since my family is quite adamant about eating meals together). Anyways, I was used to binging. So the next morning I ate some cereal. Anyways, it wasn’t THAT big of a deal... or so I thought. At school about 3 weeks later after I stayed at my friend’s house, this girl (let’s call her B ) asked me “Hey, do you eat cereal?” And I responded “Well... not really sometimes maybe? Depends on the type...?” Anyways, later my friend told me that B asked that because she thought it was weird that I ate cereal at my friend’s house. The thing is that B wasn’t even at my friend’s house that day!

This made me have a whole new set of emotions. People were watching me eat. I had disappointed her somehow. Back when I was anorexic, she said to me (while I was in “recovery” even) “Wow, I admire you so much. How can you manage to restrict?” This of course wasn’t good for my ED... 

I just think this is a vent more than anything. I’m sorry, but I honestly don’t even talk to anyone about this outside here. I just want to restrict again so much. But I just binge and binge... it sucks. I’m sure I’ll get the hang of it again maybe.

Anyway, started to try to feel better as I have a job and am a graduate student and need to function. This meant trying to eat even though my appetite  is still down. What’s shocking is that I have started to graze a bit (I mean one day I actually ate 3 normal meals, the rest maybe 500 calories a day) and the weight is still coming off. This is a contrast from previous ED times when it seemed the smallest snack, indulging in a light meal etc, created at least a small gain by the next day.

1749,Rudeen_is_tHiCc,1569033258,d74w7x,"Last night I had planned on eating pasta salad, I had it ready in a container in my mom’s fridge in her classroom so she could bring it when she picks me up from swim. I don’t blame her, but I reminded her before and after swim was over and she didn’t bring it. She made red beans and rice that night and I didn’t eat cause I planned on eating one of my fear foods for dinner. This morning my heart was beating real fast and this afternoon my heart staring beating slower and I felt like I couldn’t hold myself up. My chemistry teacher pulled me out of class to ask me if I was ok and I said “Yea, in fine. Just tired and a little sick” he kept asking if that was it and nothing else was going on but I told him that I was ok and that I texted my dad to pick me up. I didn’t know my dad had changed his number, and our service in the classroom is garbage so nothing goes through anyway. I texted my sister during my weightlifting class while we were outside, for her to text my dad to make sure he knew to pick me up. After school ended he still didn’t answer either me or my sister and my mom got mad. She said that she needed to be contacted first, which I understand she should be, but I didn’t want to bother her while she was teaching a class. She took me to swim and told her the truth, I hadn’t eaten in 2 days. I had to tell my coach the same thing and he told me I had to go home and “Carb up” for tomorrow’s meet and that he’s dealt with kids that wouldn’t eat for days before a game or meet who have died because of it. He hadn’t noticed anything, but today when I told him he relized that that’s the reason why I’ve been slacking during swim practices. Now he’s gonna be making sure I eat and have energy. I feel disgusting and sick and tomorrow I have a swim meet, I’m pretty sure that if I don’t feel good than he’s able to put someone else in my place but I don’t want to make him do another 3 hours of paperwork. Is there anyway that I can feel better by tomorrow morning? I’ve eaten the pasta salad, one and a half serving of lasagna, one slice of raisin bread, half of a small capachino blast from Duncan Donuts, a serving of cream cheese, and water, but I feel like that just made my heart feel the same or a little better, and my stomach feels weird like it wants more but like I’ll just get even worse if I do eat. I’m also scared my mom will get me a dietitian, she’s threatened to do that in the past but I’m pretty sure that getting a dietitian is too expensive anyway.

1755,lakemoonlakemoon,1568956269,d6q4qy,"I just joined this sub, and I honestly don't know if I belong here. I'm not entirely sure if I have an eating disorder, because I often feel healthy. So I guess I'm asking for advice. Here's my deal- 

I eat an ok amount of food. I usually eat a small breakfast, sometimes I don't. I prefer that I don't, because it gives me something to focus on, but I mostly eat in the mornings. I sometimes eat the designated school lunch, but when I forget money or think I might have forgotten money I get excited because I don't have to eat. I eat dinner as well, but not every night and usually small portions. However in the end, it's enough to make me not feel hungry all the time and it's enough to keep me alive.

I don't exercise, so I have no reason to eat a lot. I feel healthier when I let myself get by on the smallest amounts of food, and make eating less of a priority. I also don't care a lot about how my body looks, but sometimes after I've eaten a lot I feel fat. So I feel like I can't be anorexic because from what I've heard you have to hate your body and want to be skinny. I feel like I'm not allowed to have an eating disorder, because I'm naturally slim. But is it possible that eating and wanting the most control possible over what you eat and when counts as an eating disorder? Is it just something other than anorexia? 

Also; food grosses me out. When I eat it's not incredibly healthy, so I feel terrible about it. This makes me want to eat less but not eat better. If I ate the food I eat but in larger quantities I'd be a lot bigger. But if I exercised and ate healthy I'd probably be really skinny and actually healthy. I don't have the motivation to work out and eat healthy food, so I'm just eating small amounts of food that not food for you. 

Overall, not eating and focusing on the hunger that I have makes me feel powerful. And the feeling of being hungry and eating as little as possible makes me happy, so does this mean I have anorexia or some kind of eating disorder, or an I just lazy and unhealthy? I just feel like because I eat enough that I don't look gaunt and am naturally skinny it's not possible for me to anorexic. I'm not asking you to diagnose me, but Id really appreciate some clarity because my eating habits are taking up too much of my brain atm.

1758,esotericspeech,1570150433,dd04fg,"I’m a former anorexic who suffered for 7 years from the age of 12 to 19. I have read and believe that anorexia is a subconscious form of suicide coupled along with the desire for control and self restraint. I am still very suicidal I am now 23, even as a child I used to berate my mother for giving birth to me and used to pray to God for a car to hit me. 
Studies show that anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, but anorexics aren’t dying of malnutrition, they’re dying of suicide predominantly. Religion saved me from killing my self when I was anorexic, but now I’m an athiest and wish I’d have done it when I had the courage. Please don’t kill yourself, if you’re reading this, but I’m just being a realist life only gets worse, maybe it won’t for you but it has for me. The chances of developing another mental health disorder increase after anorexia, I subsequently developed AVPD, Autism spectrum disorder, OCD (mental compulsions), Panic attack disorder and DPDR or depersonalisation and Derealization disorder and also some psychical conditions like chronic osteoarthritis, anorexia induced lactose intolerance, IBS. As a child I had separation anxiety disorder and always had panic attacks going to school or anywhere away from my parents.  Anorexia largely impeded my education so I don’t have any formal qualifications, and my social anxiety is very strong so I haven’t been able to uphold a job for more than a few months.

I decide on a salad from Panera. He gets home after waiting there 30 minutes and they never put my food in the bag and he never checked. We live 20 minutes away so it’s not worth it to drive back so they send us a gift card instead. Great so I threw money away for nothing and have nothing to eat, because sharing his Mac n cheese just isn’t an option. So I make myself a can of soup we had in the pantry.

So some examples — my commute to uni involves standing on the metro and then some escalators. On the metro I can barely maintain my balance and feel like I’m going to collapse and everything is spinning and I’m just unstable even when I’m holding and leaning on things. On the escalators, same thing but also if I attempt to walk up them then it’s like my muscles in my legs are going to stop working.

Then when I’m standing just normally, like in the shower earlier, I keep losing my balance. When I get up from sitting, I lose my balance (without dizziness though?). When I walk up normal stairs, I struggle to walk straight.

1779,scatteredpetalsfall,1569908059,dboqck,"Ok so I’ve been steadily losing for the most part and was on a roll so to speak. Finally hit a number I was excited about and was like sweet now it’s really gonna get easier. Usually when I hit that number it’s smooth sailing if I carry on the same diet. However this week, out of nowhere, liter the day after I got to that weight, I gained a lb. and that pound has stuck around and even added a pound one day. Then went back down but not to my happier number.

Normally I would think this is water retention. I’m supposed to get my period on the 8th. But I started cramping like last week, a week early. Which again is normal, but I hadn’t bloated or anything yet. 

 Noticed that within two days my stomach was no longer as flat but fat looking. Not bloated like it’s hard, like you look pregnant but sticking out and fat and gooshier. I didn’t eat ANYTHING or drink anything fattening within the 4 days of this drastic change. I hadn’t been eating a whole hell of a lot and yes I believe there were 3 days in a row I ate maybe 100-200 more calories than I had in awhile. It was all small meals and all healthy food. It’s not like I just binged out on crap for three days and drank calories. This is why I’m confused.

If I wasn’t paranoid about starvation mode (the body clinging to literally anything more you put it in it. Which I’m not sure is true or not?) and if I hadn’t of eaten more than usual and also drank some low fat coffee mate for a week at work, I’d think it was absolutely water weight because you can gain weight a week before you begin your period.

I do have period symptoms. I’m cramping, I’m bitchy, I’m sad,8’ angry, I’m tired, my back hurts, etc. 

But I can usually tell when I’m bloated vs fat and this time I really can’t tell. Especially because of my paranoid thoughts about the food and the starvation mode.

Just last week I was looking in the mirror and saw a significant difference. My stomach was flatter. My boobs were smaller. I was close to and then at my happier number and felt to be on a roll. Then out Nowhere because I drink some coffee mate, and eat 3 meals higher in calories that are still healthy I look dramatically different? My boobs are popping out of my bra. My stomach doesn’t look pregnant and doesn’t feel hard. It feels soft and looks gooshy and gross.

Have I honestly gained two pounds of fat within 5 days????? I’m freaking out and discouraged. I’ve been dieting for a month and 2 weeks guys. It’s not easy. I’m needing to see results.

I’ve never had this much trouble losing weight before. I was only on Effexor for a month in March. Surely that isn’t long enough to completely Eff up my metabolism? I’m 32. Literally last year at 31 I lost a ton of weight on this same exact effing diet.

1814,catdaddi619,1569647523,dabtkd,"Hey good people. I’m a 22 year old college student and I am 6’1 (for weight to height purposes) and it just hit me that I may have an issue. 

In high school, I  had a relatively average body. I definitely could have lost a few pounds but still looked fine. I began focusing on dieting and exercising in 10th grade and cleaned up my diet a lot. This was the first and only time I lost weight a healthy way. After I lost about 15 pounds and toned up, I noticed, (as well as my classmates) that I looked so much better. I always kind of knew that I was a pretty decent looking dude compared to the other kids at my school, due to the attention I received from girls (despite being gay, but no one knew yet) as well as strangers making flattering comments more often than not, but I never put much thought into it. After I got in better shape though, I really started to get attention, and this gave me a confidence I never had. After getting stopped by a recruiter for a modeling agency when I was 17 I enjoyed the few shoots that I did, but wasn’t too comfortable in that world. After I stopped modeling for a few months, I began to loosen the reins on my diet a lot and gained some weight back, nothing drastic. Here comes the fun part. 

When I arrived to college, I joined the “best” fraternity on campus, and i use quotation marks because the only reason for that title was because they only recruited the best looking guys that would rush. This made me a lot more aware of how I looked and I began to eat just about one meal a day while exercising about once a day. Things were fine until I went from one meal a day to one meal every two days. I never worried about myself though because I felt fine and loved the attention I was getting as my face became more and more chiseled. Eventually, by the start of my second year at school I was 145 (my weight when I entered college was about 195). I never thought I had a problem though. 

Fast forward a bit, and it’s the beginning of junior year,  I entered my first very serious relationship for about a year and 3 months and I ended up gaining some weight from being so comfortable. In October 2018, I ended up up in rehab for a dependency on pills (xanax and, yup, you guessed it, adderall... that is an entirely different story). I actually had a great experience learning about myself and didn’t focus on what I ate at all while I was there for two months, going from 180 at the time, to about 195. After rehab my boyfriend and I broke up and between all the changes  in my life and feeling so lonely I began binging again and got up to a whopping 235 pounds. (My heaviest weight yet). Finally, time healed those wounds as it usually does, and I began focusing on my health again to lose weight starting at the end of August 2019, I started to see results and my addictive personality came back out. I quickly started skipping meals again, excited to wake up thinner the next morning. 

Fast forward to now, (not even 35 days later, and I weigh 202 pounds as of today). I feel proud of myself for doing it without adderall. I never really weigh myself, I just go by what I see, but I decided to today and was blown away that I had lost over 30 pounds in about a month without exercise. This forced me to be aware of this issue. The happiness I felt when I saw that number was insane. I don’t care about how drastically I am losing weight, I just care that it’s gone. Now, I am afraid that I may anorexic. And even more afraid that I don’t want to do anything about it. I’ve realized no matter how much weight I lose, I will never be content with my body and will always want to lose more. I have convinced myself that not eating is the norm. I think I’m on my 3rd or 4th day now without anything but water, and don’t even want to think about my next meal because now that I know how much weight I have lost, I only want to lose more. I get lost in this toxic cycle where I become obsessed with not eating and losing weight and I’m not sure what to do. I know it’s not healthy, but I can’t stop. I just want to look perfect no matter what it takes. I feel so out of control, that same feeling I felt before I went to rehab, but instead of drugs, it’s now starving. I don’t want to go down this path because I know where it will take me, but I know I’m not going to stop because I’m in the mindset again where nothing matters but losing as much weight as possible. I know this was all over the place but I don’t know what to do. My stomach is turning in pain and I can’t bring myself to eat anything.

1822,moondenim,1569572388,d9xclb,"Hi all, first time poster here. I've had a long history with poor eating habits, struggling with both anorexia &amp; bulimia throughout being a teenager (I'm almost 21 now). I went through about a year-long period around junior year of high school where I heavily restricted my calories &amp; ended up losing a scary amount of weight, although I never became underweight so no one really took my disorder very seriously, even though it was drastic &amp; earned me lots of VERY positive reinforcement for my weight loss.

...One of the things I used to cherish the most was being able to see or feel my bones more easily as I lost more &amp; more weight.

I fully recovered &amp; have been eating (relatively) normally for almost three years now, not gaining all of the weight back but definitely gaining enough to be at what looks like ""normal"" for me. But recently, as I've moved out of my family home &amp; have been working a ridiculous amount along with doing theatre, I've started losing weight without a conscious effort. I'll skip meals very often, &amp; more than occasionally will go through the majority of my day before realizing I haven't eaten. Even though I'm not hyper-focused on counting calories again, I do find myself feeling my ribs through the flesh on my upper chest for comfort, and grabbing my stomach abusively when I feel hungry instead of getting up to do something about it, or intentionally avoiding the grocery store both due to lack of finances &amp; a lack of desire to spend the money I DO have on food. I don't have access to a scale so I don't even know if I've actually lost any weight, or if I'm just having a mental relapse in avoiding eating, but proceeding like it's not as much of a problem because ""it's not on purpose"" (even though, I know it actually is). I haven't weighed myself in months, but when I was recently measured for a costume fitting I found that I'd lost several inches around my bust/hips/legs etc, so I know this physical change is real, even though the comments are nowhere near the volume that they used to be. &amp; I love it. I don't feel sick, because I'm not weighing myself or counting calories, but I am obsessed with the feeling of my bones through my skin &amp; my clothes getting looser &amp; looser on me, &amp; I'm afraid I won't be able to shake this before more people start commenting on how good I look &amp; the illness gets stronger from the positive reinforcement.

Can anybody relate to this? How do you encourage yourself to eat when you're ridiculously busy &amp; skipping meals &amp; chalking it up to being forgetful is just so fucking easy?

1832,Elysiumthistime,1570705420,dfwdjg,"Hi,

So I was never formally diagnosed with an eating disorder but after my Mom lost for 5 year battle with cancer I fell further and further into a pit of self hatred and despair and wanted nothing more than to disappear. Between the ages of 15 and 18 were the worst and I was frequently restricting to 300-500 calories. I binged on occasion but would always exercise excessively after to try and counteract my perceived damage.

When I went to college, my first year was a mess (which included taking a lot ecstasy after I realised it killed your appetite for days afterwards). I lost a lot of weight but never felt thin.

I reached out for help while at uni and even went to a therapist for a while but I didn't like how all she wanted to do was talk about my Mom so I told her I felt fine again, lied on the assessment sheet and left, never to return. I vowed to fix myself and slowly over the following years, I drowned out the voice in my head telling me I'm a failure for eating a sandwich. 

Today. I'm at my heightest weight. Over the past few years I've been binging more frequently and haven't been exercising excessively like before because that is dangerous behaviour which might lead to relapse, or so I told myself. 

So I've been trying to get a grip on my binging. Being around people helps so I try not spend too much time alone and I'm working on being more strict with myself without being too strict like I used to be.

The problem is, after I decided to sort myself out in uni, I started feeling very uneasy whenever I felt hungry, almost like my mind was worried I'd fall back into old habits. But recently, I've found myself having to miss lunch for legitimate reasons and instead of feeling uneasy like before or even neutral about it, I started feeling like maybe I should skip dinner too.

hi.. i suppose this will be a bit of a rant / pent up venting. sorry it’ll be so ramble-y and disjoined but i kinda just need a space to air out my thoughts.. hopefully this is the right place.

a little tmi background about my situation: i’ve been dealing with ibs for the past few months consecutively but have lived with it for a few years in different forms (from extreme discomfort and bloating to constipation). currently i’m in a cycle of durational constipation that manages itself with constricted eating and weekly laxative flushes. 

recently i’ve lost a lot of weight because i couldn’t deal with the pain of eating and holding the bulk in for a week, and it’s easier to manage this way especially since i’m in uni and the hours are long (9-6 and often goes until 10/11pm most nights). my weight loss (7-8kg over 6 months, 10-12kg over 1 year) has caused a lot of conflict in my family because of my super caring parents who express their concern with grief and desperation for me to eat more knowing that it hurts so much after. i’ve changed my diet from pescatarian to vegan avoiding gluten and swapped out foods that seem to aggravate the situation. i’m still observing and trying to see what works and what doesn’t, eliminating many foods and now going periods not eating. over time i’ve developed a very unhealthy relationship with food and eating, and it becomes ceremonious to have meals with my family, which i try to keep up over the weekend followed by a tormenting flush. it doesn’t help that i’m motivated by the number on the scale and that my body image is so entwined with my ibs... it’s put me in such a spot and there are so many stresses. 

i’m currently overseas with my family dining out every meal and they recently gathered to have an intervention, ending up with my sibling calling me anorexic and depressed..... my parents are touring and i’m now alone on a school exchange and i’ve never felt so lost and in a pit, juggling both ibs, body image, social anxiety and an over-stretched stomach that keeps calling for food. it’s so cold, my prof keeps telling me to eat more, and i feel really really alone. i’ve spent the whole day in tears, sweatpants and under the duvet. i also feel really dumb for stressing over this but i guess i’m just not in a good situation for my digestive/mental wellbeing.

1842,riessk4,1570598566,dfchbg,"I don’t know if I have an eating disorder. It all started when I was in middle school. I ate healthy and the right amount of food. I was determined to get to my healthiest self and eventually started getting abs and I was so excited. Then about a year later in highschool, I started having problems with my parents. They started feeling like strangers to me and we were never close after then. They told me they loved me but by their emotionally abusive words, It all felt fake. They didn’t know that I didn’t like them and felt like they weren’t real parents so I had all of this kept secret for forever. They were almost never home and stopped going to the grocery store a lot-maybe once or twice a month but stopped buying anything slightly nutritious cause they ate out without me and never really cared. Every time they went to the store they came home with only like 5 things like chips and peanut butter. Since I didn’t have a way to get healthy food, I thought it would be better to not eat than to eat junk food and ruin my fitness journey. I would eat occasionally, but very few calories. It sort of became addicting to me. Some days I felt like I absolutely couldn’t eat and my mind couldn’t convince me to because I felt like this was the only thing I could control in my life. Some days I woke up and my disordered thoughts wouldn’t pop up till the next day and I could eat regularly. Other days I was so hungry and felt like I was going to pass out so I would binge cause I was scared of passing out and getting caught. Then I felt guilty and the whole cycle would start over again. Now I am a junior in high school and even though I’m not close to my parents anymore, they started buying healthier food, so there is food in the fridge that I can eat and live out a healthier lifestyle again, but I can’t let go of the thought of losing control. I feel like my problems with eating gave me control when I had no control over years of abuse I went through. Since it became comfortable to me, healthy food and nutrition became scary to me because I felt like at some point I would be neglected again. I knew I was the only one who could control my eating habits so I felt safe not eating. I wake up in the morning and never pack a lunch for school because eating in front of people gives me so much anxiety now. I feel like if I’m around food with people I can’t function and it scares me so much. I go straight to work and then work till late at night and have something small under 200 calories to eat and then Ai don’t eat at all when I get back home. This cycle repeats every day. I’m scared of myself and what I’m doing to myself but if physically and mentally feels like I got myself stuck and I absolutely cannot eat. I don’t know if so have an eating disorder because I am Normal weight now and despite the fact that I starve, I barely loose any noticeable weight.

I don’t take pics right now because I’m not at my goal weight or even my happy weight. But I cringed through it. 

She posted the group one online. After I had already done my usual photoshopping. So I had to go in and change out the one she took with the one I photoshopped of myself. Cause people would see mine then see the one on my work page and see they are different. Plus I hated the original (of course)

So I’m an admin for the page and I switched them. I didn’t change anyone else just me. And even for me and my BDD I could tell the changes I made weren’t crazy extreme that people wouldn’t recognize me.

I thinned myself a bit and whitened my teeth and that was all. And she saw in my page that I did the same with the pic of my boss and I. 

Also at work she’s noticed I never eat lunch. She leaves before me everyday. But she even said something about it or asks every day if I’ve eaten or if I’m gonna eat which is kind of annoying. I always lie and say I had a huge breakfast I’m not a lunch person I’ll have dinner I’m fine. 

She’s an Athlete so she’s very in shape and ironically extremely thin. Like crazy thin. Like if she wasn’t an athlete I prob would assume she’s also anorexic.

Anyway what’s REALLY bothering me is,  now that it’s super obvious she keeps making comments about how “tiny” I am. She’ll throw it in a sentence or two everyday now. And I know she’s only saying it because she’s trying to make me feel better probably and feels Bad. But it makes
Me feel worse to hear pity compliments. She even went as far as to say I’m tinier than her which and I’m being super real, the girl is 5’7 and like 115 lbs. im 5’2 and 106. Yes I’m small atm to most other people who don’t suffer with this, but she’s 5’7 at the MOST 115 and also allllll lean muscle. So no, I’m maybe shorter but she’s trying I can tell to say I’m smaller as in skinnier. It made me wonder if she herself has an ED and BDD or if she’s really going above and beyond to make me feel skinny. Either way her asking me if I’ve eaten all the time and making the tiny comments are triggering as hell and starting to bother me. And I feel like I can’t say anything :( I I know she’s either just concerned and feels bad she’s truly a good person. She isn’t one of those catty girls who is all “I’m concerned” but just jealous not concerned Or she herself has an ED and perhaps my behaviors make her competitive or she’s trying to show she understands? Either way it’s a hard position to be in. 

I think if the picture thing never happened I could have gotten away with the whole I don’t eat lunch thing. We don’t always work together.  And we are allowed to leave for lunch. But once the pic thing happened I knew for sure she’d know. It was her pic I switched out. The changes were even small I bet no one else even noticed. I made sure not to over do it and it was hard but I didn’t. Maybe one other person knows but I don’t care if she does because she’s never there.

Today in health class we practised moving injured people (you know, making a little chair thing with your arms and picking up the person) and one pair was struggling to pick up the other person. So the person they were trying to pick up said 'why don't you try Aiiga? She's small' (I'm probably the shortest person in my class) and I came over, because my name was mentioned and I wanted to help. Then, one of the girls looked at me and said 'no, I can't do it. She's too heavy.'. 

And, honestly, up to that moment I thought I was completely fine, I've even started eating normally again. But at that moment I was so crushed. I asked her what she just said, visibly shaking (at least I didn't yell at the poor thing). It took all my strength not to start crying and not to embarass myself further, thought I don't know if I could feel more humiliated.

I'm not significantly underweight... I'm too fat to be underweight... And the weird twisted thing is obviously I didn't like to hear that but a small part of me was happy about that and I don't think I have a problem.

However they then told me that my height to weight was 77.31 and that I couldn't go to school until it gets to 80 bc they're worried about the strain it might have on my heart.

I've had atypical anorexia my whole life because of childhood issues and food allergies so I knew something was wrong but I couldn't really know for sure and she doesn't like to communicate with me much.
So I started continually bombing her with questions about her eating habits because I only see her for a few hours a day and I'm not sure what shes eating when we're not together.

1862,x24throwaway,1570503263,deu4bb,"Do any of your parents do this? Or have they? It’s something that has frustrated me and felt like and invasion of my own privacy the entire time it has been going on. 

I was diagnosed for the first time when I was a teenager, a little over a decade ago. 

At the time, my mother joined some online forum for parents of children with EDs and they would all go on there and talk about us and our weights and what we were eating and our treatments and what they knew from our therapy and their (incorrect, often) interpretations. 

I knew about this site and my friend and I found my mother’s account back when I was about 15. The things she was sharing about me were often things I thought were private and MINE and that she had zero business to share with anyone, let alone strangers. Then she’d share her take on me and what I was doing, and trust me, she does not understand at all yet she and all the other parents thought she (and themselves) was correct. It infuriated me, but I wasn’t supposed to know any of this so never said anything. An example. She wrote about the hospital that tubed me, literally traumatised me, PRAISING THEM. Anyway. 

These people are her “friends” now and she no longer uses that site, to the best of my knowledge (I haven’t looked for close to a decade). But they are all on Facebook and she has none of her real-life friends on FB, just these parents. So now on FB, all these parents post about is ED stuff. I’m in my mid-20s and just walked into her office and saw her writing a comment that started “my d” (my daughter) but I didn’t see the rest as she quickly closed the tab. 

I feel disgusted and ashamed and exposed and like my privacy is violated that she is writing about me and my struggles, back then and especially now that I’m well and truly an adult. I don’t even share with her so it’s all what she interprets incorrectly. But then I’m not supposed to know these things. I understand her wanting an outlet but she can do that without disclosing personal things about me.

Am I correct that she doesn’t have the right to be sharing details about me and what I go through? Or am I overreacting? Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do?

1863,MahouCherry,1570493278,des530,"So I started with all this when I was like 12. I was the ugly fat and poor girl in a rich girls school so of fucking course I was bullied. I stopped eating (or puking), it was 2012 so all this tumblr thinspo stuff made things worst. I still remember the mirror inside my closet in my old room, full of ""pretty girls don't eat"" and ""do you want to be thin or do you want that burger"" shit.

The two months I losed 10kg. I'm 1.65cm but was a little shorter back then.

So, it continued untill I was 16 and I only stopped that time I ended in an hospital because I was in really bad shape. Funny thing is, even if my body changed and I losed weight, I never got skinny. Like really really skinny (that's why no one ever noticed they just thought I was losing weight in a healthy way because I looked healthy)

I learned that I just can't be skinny, I can't have a flat stomach or small tights. I don't consider myself chubby not skinny. My body is a weird in between.

I learned to live with this, and now I'm 19 and I was kinda good with it. But no, not really.

I've never stoped hating that one, that one only tummy roll or my too big tights. My arms that are too skinny in comparison of the rest of me. I can't. I feel bad. I feel like I'm in school again, my uni is full of pretty rich girls (just like in school, I'm only here because I won a scholarship). And again I feel like the ugly, fat, poor girl. Even if I'm not really fat, even if I don't fucking consider being fat a bad thing.

I have no problem with being fat, my problem is with my body being my body. I'm not fat, not skinny, not chubby I'm just me and I hate it.

What triggered it? I loved my skirts, a lot. Tight and short but not too short. Now my tights are too big and my skirts are way too shorts for me to wear at uni. (It's literally full of stairs so no thanks).

I haven't been eating this week and I feel like an idiot for believing that I could live with this. How could I?

Yes, I have professional help. And yes, I also have a severe depression that I developed kinda at the same time but for different issues. If anyone has any advise on how to just not relapse that would be cool. But honestly I know no one will read this.

Still, I stay on the lower end of a healthy weight, sometimes dipping below healthy - I only know this from doctor appointments where they weigh me, I don't monitor my weight. I think this is because I still hate eating. Whenever I eat anything, I feel guilt and disgust. It's more like a chore than anything else, and it's probably my least favourite chore at that.

So I don't eat much. I am also reluctant to cook, because whatever I make I know I'll be unable to fully enjoy. So it's mostly quick meals - mostly healthy, low fat meals - and snacking on bananas and grapes throughout the day. Heck, sometimes I'll have some tea (no milk or sugar) and call that a meal. I have days where I feel light headed and weak as a result of this.

Her: You have helped me so much approach self love. I hope that you can find the courage to approach it yourself.

Me: I have love for myself... Just no kindness. Unyielding fights for survival. I can't relate to my body. My body is treacherous, and going against my need to survive and thrive. It must be cut out. 

Her: This is heartbreaking to read because it sounds like psychologically you're committed to dying. Your body is innocent, my love.

Me: If you think that I need to hear that, then i probably shoud. I don't feel suicidal, I feel rational.

Her: Suicide is often about rationality, in my humble experience. But self love is a choice. 

(then she talked about my futile attempts to love someone that wasn't accepting my love)

Her: Sometimes we must first choose to be kind-- not because it comes from an inspired, passionate place, but because it is the first step to becoming well. In this whole life, you will have many loves and many loses, you already have. But your body will be a constant companion. It will not leave you, you will ultimately leave it. And it will serve you as a devoted and dedicated slave until the moment you draw your last breath.

The came dizziness. Dizziness is easy to deal with, you’ve suffered with it all your life, but the intensity was horrid and wasn’t like before. Anxiety hit a new high and blackouts became normal. People thought it was normal because it wasn’t common, at first.
First it was a a single size down, then 2, then all of a sudden, your buying size 3 pants when you were originally a 7. People then noticed. People noticed the bones popping out, noticed the decrease in energy, and the fact that you stopped growing.
It goes on for a while, recovering for a short period of time when people notice. But you don’t start recovery until you notice your person loses sleep and cries because of you. So you make a promise that would save your life.
95 days in recovery you release you’ll never be the time. You notice your joint pain more and more, The dizziness gets worse, and therapy appointments become the norm. Your energy doesn’t get any better and you’ll be short forever.
You’ll never be the same and people will always know you as the anorexic girl. But without it, you wouldn’t have been diagnosed with learning disabilities and ADHD. You wouldn’t be in the mists of finding out about it your joint pain and dizziness. And you wouldn’t be with the person you are with today.

Afterwards, I went to the movies and had some popcorn (that wasn’t counted). This is a lot more than I usually eat and when I got out of the cinema I started feeling really weird. 

I basically couldn’t walk properly, I was stumbling around everywhere, my speech made no sense and I was really confused about everything (where I was etc). I was having sweats and hot flushes. 

I called NHS direct (I live in the UK), and then advised me to go to A and E but when I went they said I was low priority and probably should go home.

I’m just wondering if anyone else had experienced this and if so could give me a clue as to what happened? I feel fine now, I’m just kinda worried.

1927,gaiame,1570904909,dgywxp,"This isn’t a vent, but a question. No flair for that. 

I’m 45 and recently slipped into anorexia over the past two months. I was trying to lose 10 lbs. after eating a very poor diet for most of last year. Also one of my EDs. I binged in candy and pasta. I ate until I felt sick. Never purged. I’ve never been underweight before. 

After decades of trying to find the right mental health care I was quickly able to stop binging  completely. So I lost the few lbs and got down to my typical weight, which has always been on the low end of acceptable weight for my height. I ate healthy and wasn’t restricting. But I think cutting out almost everything from my binge diet totally changed my outlook on food. 

And then I kept losing. Food didn’t taste the same anymore. I didn’t want to eat. I got full quickly. I have IBS, which has complicated things. I started a new medication and that made me nauseous for a few days then got sick (nothing major but enough to make me not want to eat.) Now I’m 7 lbs under weight and my BMI is below 17.5. My psychologist and SO have commented on it. My clothes are falling off me. I can feel all my bones. I don’t want to stay like this let alone get worse.

One thing I would like to say to you young people is please try to embrace recovery at an early age. I thought I was the best at my ED especially in high school. I thought I had it mastered and it was my main focus and now it’s just something that I would love to put behind me, and I’m still working on that. It’s taken relationships, happiness, self image and so much more away from me. All because of what? Some food? Learn to eat healthy and live a healthy lifestyle at a young age. Don’t let this spiral out of rebellion. 

Take care of yourself because at the end of the day this is YOUR life, when your sick and in the throws of this disease you will be the only one that can get you out of it and at once you get past a certain point it will only become more difficult. It does not have to get there. If your parents are bothering you that’s a sign that you are mature enough to logically communicate with them and if you don’t have logical parents like most of us don’t then it’s going to be up to you to do all you can to reach out to a trusted adult to help you. 

I know this is hard. Life isn’t always gonna be fun times like my grandma says, so do the work to feel better. Learn how to make good decisions for yourself. This mental illness can take over your mind if YOU let it. It doesn’t have to get there. If you truly have no one to talk to and you can’t afford treatment the journaling will be your best friend! If you believe in God then also pray! This is also a wonderful subreddit so stay as active as you can on here and don’t be afraid to vent. 

I know there are a lot of ignorant people in this world, (sometimes even in this very subreddit) but don’t let them get you down. 

Don’t let anyone bully you, cut off toxic friends and people from your life relentlessly and unapologetically. Do whatever is best for YOU! I wish I had someone to tell me these things when I was younger and even now. Don’t let anyone baby you, now isn’t the time for that. It’s time to grow up and face the reality that you are sick and need to get better. Focus on yourself as much as you can until you see positive results and don’t stop when things are gong well, that’s the trick! Keep going!

hi all, this could be very triggering for some people as i go pretty in depth about my body type and numbers.

She has always been skinny (Around 100-110 pounds in the last couple years) and I never thought she had an eating disorder before, but she told me today that she weighs 85 pounds ( she's 5'3 and 19 years old.) This was shocking to me and I was surprised that she didn't think it was bad. This gives her a bmi of 15.06 which is severely underweight and apparently from what I've read when you get to the 11-13 range you become very likely to die. She says that she doesn't have an eating disorder because she doesn't have the 'mindset' but regardless she is still not eating enough so I don't see why that should make me less concerned. I guess from her point of view, she doesn't think she's fat so that means she doesn't have an eating disorder. But she's still not eating enough for some reason. I don't know why. It could be a lack of appetite but I feel like, being a similar height and age as her, if I saw my weight go down to 85 I would be concerned and start eating more even if I wasn't hungry. She needs to be eating 1500 a day just to maintain her weight and I don't think she's eating that which means she's going to keep losing. I recently had a friend die in a car crash and I don't want to lose someone else. I thought about talking to her boyfriend about it because I'm an hour and a half away and I can't remind her to eat/make her eat, but I don't want to cause problems because they have a sort of unstable relationship. Since she's away at college and an adult there's not a parent I can talk to who would force her to get treatment. I'm not really sure how to deal with this. I knew that she liked being skinny but I didn't expect her to drop 15 pounds in like ten weeks out of nowhere. I'm not sure how to talk to her, I don't think she's taking it seriously. She's had obsessions in the past about wanting to be shorter, or smaller, and as long as I can remember since middle school she's talked about not eating a lot and sleeping like 3 hours a night.

Background: I was diagnosed with anorexia in 2012. I never got proper therapy, I just gained a ton of weight on birth control and nobody talked about it. I stopped purging, but I was still restricting. Medication has been a wild ride, because after the birth control came an antidepressant that took it all off, to the point I was underweight and had to stop taking it. What they replaced it with made me gain almost 100lbs. And then as luck would have it my current med lineup is perfect, and I’ve lost all the weight. Losing weight felt really good. Putting on pants that didn’t fit a few months ago felt really good. Getting acknowledged by everyone I know felt really good. I’ve spent the entire last year on a loop of “have you lost weight?” “Yep, Xlbs!” “You look great!” But I’m really really trying here. I’m not allowed to lose more than 5lbs more. When I found out I’d lost 3lbs, I panicked. That gives me 2lbs before I start losing the things I need. So I bought like pop tarts for breakfast, that instant breakfast stuff you mix into milk, like a huge tub of cheese balls to try and eat while I’m doing homework and distracted. I’m trying so hard. And I mean I’m torn because my instinct is not to have those things because they’re empty calories, but also I don’t want to lose my medication. I almost wonder if my doctor set a weight limit because I have a history of eating disorder? My BMI is still on the high end of healthy and I don’t understand. But whatever.

It’s hard enough fighting with myself over it all day. But my dad has started up again about it and I can’t with that. He saw me pouring instant breakfast and said “do you have any idea how much sugar is in that?” I’ve told him I need to stop losing weight. And when I said I need to work harder on eating enough calories for my new metabolism, he said “but you’re not going to *put on* any, right?” With just this tone of disgust. And I can’t handle it. And I don’t know what to do. I haven’t really had the urge to purge in years, but every time he says something it makes me want to. So I just go in the bathroom and argue with myself and cry.

That part stopped at the beginning of this week (surprisingly early) and now I’m eating 3 normal meals a day. I finally caved and weighed myself today for the first time, because I thought I was starting to actually look better somehow. I figured I must have gained at least 5lbs and looked better because of that somehow. When I used to fast, I would gain weight from just a few random meals.

Hi everyone, I’m not officially diagnosed with anorexia or an ED, but I have been very obsessive over my weight (specifically losing it through restricting/purging) for about 12 years now. My father always told me I was obese as a kid, which looking back I definitely was not, and that I would die by the age of 12 of a heart attack from my unhealthy weight. Ever since then, it has become a lifelong goal for me to lose weight but I just can’t seem to get rid of it. My weight has always fluctuated from my binging and restricting/purging periods, and occasional points when I try healthy eating and exercising. However, having PTSD at the same time - it’s sometimes hard for me to get out of bed to actually get out and have the energy to do anything at all, least of all exercise. Lately my thoughts around food have been getting much worse. They’ve become all-consuming, paired with intense self-deprecation and self-harm because of how much hatred and disgust I feel towards myself. I stopped feeling hungry, or just ignore it so well that I don’t notice it anymore. I’ve had about 1 small dinner’s worth of food in the past two days because I feel nauseous at the thought of eating, and feel like I don’t deserve to eat because I let myself get so fat that I need to lose weight (I’m 5’2”, around 75kg). Although I inherently know that I’m not grotesquely obese, it’s all I can see in the mirror - and all I can see when I pinch at my skin and all the fat underneath it. I’m now unable to sleep because I find the urge to lose weight so overwhelming and crave doing sit-ups now at 2am just to burn off some extra calories.

1977,scatteredpetalsfall,1571727439,dle5fe,"He asked me all the standard questions. And then he said “Are you eating...?” In sort of a concerned way. He doesn’t actually know about my eating disorder history. When I met him I was 27 lbs heavier. So honestly that question made my day. Because no one else in my life except my mom has acknowledged my weight loss.

And I get it, no one who knows me wants to Eff with saying the wrong things when they know I have an eating disorder. I think they know by now saying *anything* is a problem. If they say I look healthy I think I’m fat. If they say I look too thin, it fuels me to keep going. And they’d never say I look overweight even if I am.

But it felt really good for someone to acknowledge this, not just because obviously we always wanna hear that concerned “omg you’re so thin” or “are you eating enough??” It felt good because I really truly (not in an anorexic way of thinking but realistically) gained like over 30 lbs within 3 months due to grieving and depression. So I honestly was too big for my size. And it took a shit ton of discipline and exercise to get where I am right now. Which, to some might look normal. To some might look small, (especially people who met me when I gained all the weight) and to some might look way too small. Honestly, this is an “ok” weight for me where I’m not gonna be utterly miserable but I’m also not satisfied. It’s healthy ENOUGH to pass for just possibly being a smaller individual. It’s close to the weight I normally fall at when I’m not under or overeating. But it’s def not my happy goal weight. It’s 10 lbs away from that. 

I wish when people said that to me it didn’t light a fire in me to keep going, or that it didn’t make my entire week. That my existence and my happiness literally laid upon anything else than someone noticing I’ve lost a lot of weight in just two months. He asked me how much I weigh and I lied and said I was about 7 lbs heavier to be in the triple digits. He said “ok well, keep eating and stay there ! Or else you’ll waste away” this made me even happier and also feel sick at the same time. I hate how unhealthy and sick this disease is. It shouldn’t make me happy to hear that or inspire me to lose more. Or make me feel like I’ve succeeded but it does. That’s just the name of the game. 

Highlight of my week, one person finally acknowledging I lost 27 lbs. did I need to lose 27? Most people would think not. I don’t care. My boyfriend doesn’t think I look too thin yet hasn’t complimented me. My mom said she can tell I’m “starving myself or over exercising again” but that’s it. Maybe I just wanted to hear the smallest of recognition for something I did work hard at for two months. I went way overboard in eating and lost control. I finally found discipline and lost it in just two months and a week and a half or so. 

Still though. I hate this disease. If someone says I’m smart it makes me happy. If someone says they’re concerned for my effing health I’m on cloud 9.

I’m loving my thin body and when I gain weight I will love that too! 

I’m coming out of a multi week depression.  I’ve been journaling a lot and that helps more than anything. I’ve done my hair, will do my nails and resume life as usual. I’m going to get out of the house and be social now that I’ve regained my confidence and I’m just very happy to be feeling like myself again. I’ve been praying a lot! Glory be to God! I’m so happy to be mentally happy more than anything. This body is a vessel and I just want to respect it by making myself healthy and thinking happy thoughts. I can’t believe I’m finally out of this terrible funk. Feeling back to myself is so wonderful. 

Terrible moments in life happen, but strengthening your mind during that time is the most important thing to do. Over these few weeks I’ve been doing all I can for myself such as eating of course. Which in the beginning I could only drink meal replacement smoothies until my appetite came back. I also read books in the park, spent time with family, and just took better care of myself overall by cutting out a lot of negativity and drama in my life. Some of the trash actually took itself out little did I know.

I really want all of you to love yourselves at all stages of this disease. If you are feeling bad just know as long as you want better eventually you will get better and be better! Whatever that is for you. 

I don’t have a goal weight or anything, but I do have a goal of consistent healthy eating,  healthy thinking and consistently taking care of myself. 

Never neglect yourself by worrying about someone else and their sadness or happiness. Never fall into thinking it’s someone else’s job to make you happy especially when they didn’t even volunteer to do that! It’s a recipe for disaster. Take care of yourselves.

I never spoke about this, because i feel so ashamed about it... As i was a child (9 or 10 years old) always got weird feelings about fat people and gaining weight. I've fantasized about getting fed and gaining weight. That was the first memories of myself discovering my sexuality. I never was fat or too fat, maybe a little bit chubby as child but i got bullied in school for my weight and i tried to lose weight as soon as possible, so i fasted. I've soon developed an eating disorder. First anorexia, then it turned to bulimia and afterwards to binge eating with bulimia. Since i was 12 years old, i was obsessed with losing weight and being skinny. My fetish of gaining weight and fat in genereal was soon forgotten. The years past and i was getting worse. I tried to kill myself a few times and selfharmed all the time. I actually abused many many drugs for weight loss. As i turned 18, i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and atypical eating disorder (and a few others). I have been in therapy since i was 13 years old, but not generally for eating disorders, because my bpd makes all of the disorders worse. There was a time when i was getting better with my eating disorder, but as soon as my bpd was getting worse again, my ed was getting there too. by that time i was sure about having a fatphobia, but somehow i was also turned on by fat and fat women. that messed with my brain a lot (i will never be able to talk about this out loud to someone). so i'm 21 years old now and in therapy but if i make efforts in my eating disorder my bpd is making it bad again. i've always tried to push that fetish away, but a few days ago, i've watched feederism porn and i've felt so turned on, that i can't push it away again and i feel so confused, because i'm so so so anxious about gaining weight but i also fantasize about feederism (both, getting fed and feed someone). It's so strange, when i'm turned on and have sex with my boyfriend i think my body is too thin and i want to gain weight, but when i'm not horny i think i'm too big and my eating disorder tells me to lose weight again (I don't actually try to lose weight anymore, but the feeling never vanished)... That makes no sense to me. I've seen a few posts about anorexics having that fetish too, but i wanted to share my story about having this fetish and maybe there is someone who understands me?

1998,kellfae,1571605699,dkpwha,"i've been doing really well lately. for the most part i can shut down the ED logic. i'm pretty short and i inherited my dad's muscular build (""strong north german legs like tree trunks,"" he likes to say) so i know realistically i'd probably die before i ever reached this distorted ideal image i hold in my mind. it's just not physically possible. 

i should be proud of my body. sometimes i manage to be. i have a really physically demanding job, and i'm damn good at it. people at my work are regularly surprised by my strength, and that feels good. i like being strong. i like the idea that some sad day (hopefully very far off) when my dad is gone, i'll still be able to literally see his traits in myself. 

and then i'll see a girl, in real life or online or wherever, blessed with long lean limbs and proportions i could never achieve because most of the time she's got at least six inches of height on me, and all that feeling good about myself just evaporates, replaced by this paradoxical concept of “haha, stumpy. you’ll never look like that. still, you should probably eat less anyways!”

i have arguments against it. the main one is that i’ve been growing my hair for years now and it’s getting very close to my goal length and i tell myself if i starve then i’ll lose all that progress because my body is not gonna prioritize energy for something so superficial as hair and it’ll thin out and stop growing. that helps, most of the time. 

the most frustrating part is that i can see beauty in all kinds of body types. i’ll see people much heavier than me and admire the way they carry themselves. i don’t hold anyone but myself to this impossible standard, and i wish i could just let it go.

2001,snowflakez101,1571574251,dkixw9,"This is my first ever post and blog and I'm going to write about my anorexia disorder.

I've been suffering from anorexia for about a year now. I know, some of you are going ""only a year?! I've suffered longer"" or ""I know someone who suffered longer"". It's true that most people suffer from anorexia way longer than a year but that doesn't mean it's any less damaging and all you who suffered from anorexia should know.

I can't exactly pinpoint when it started. It was near the end of the school year last year when every reason that contributed to my disorder started coming together.

My so called ""friend"" from school started showing her true colours. The nice, loving, caring girl I thought I knew started becoming a mean, attention seeking person. She begun faking an eating disorder in hopes of getting more attention.

""I need to lose weight"" she would say ""anyone wanna eat my lunch; otherwise, I'm throwing it away""

Now, she wouldn't call me fat or ugly; in fact, she would compare herself to me, saying that I was thin, pretty and normal (and I was a normal healthy weight) but because of how much she was talking about her weight, I slowly started becoming self conscious about my weight. I started eating less(though back then, it was still within a normal portion) and exercise (still a healthy amount back then).

But then this happened:

My mum looked at me and said ""you look nice and slim now; unlike before when I used to bake so many things and you were chubbier"". My mum simply meant to only compliment me, saying I was pretty but hearing this made me think that she meant I was fat, which was really triggering and I became motivated to exercise more.

A few weeks before school ended that year, I asked my friend(a different one from the attention seeking girl) if she think I would eat less next time we met. I covered it up by saying I would have to do loads of cleaning during the holidays so I wouldn't have much time to eat. She didn't get suspicious about this or think about it much; instead, she simply said this: ""no way. You eat a lot"".

I remembered how I had vowed to look as good as the mannequin in that dress when I tried it on my own self, and that I swore I’d do what it takes to be able to zip it all of the way up, not just most of the way up. It would only be a matter of a couple more pounds. I’d done so well already. It shouldn’t be too hard.

“Just a few more pounds, though, and I will be able to wear it even with some room to spare! Wouldn’t that be great?” Was my instant thought. No sense of pride in accomplishing my original goal. No sense of satisfaction, of confidence in myself, just the ever-burning desire to be even BETTER. I’d accomplished my first goal- and so what? What did it matter when I could now reach another, even better one? I don’t feel beautiful now, like I tricked myself into believing I would when I first bought this dress. And I still won’t feel beautiful when it fits me a little more loosely.

Here’s what’s helped me and what has been helping me. 

I could not see myself eating. It was just a power that was beyond my personal humanly control, but today I made a big slice of lasagna and still could not see myself eating it. I often get repulsed by food. So I began to pray. Before, during and after I said this prayer and I’m almost done with this task. 

“Lord thank you for the food that I am about to consume for the nourishment of my mind, body and soul” 

I often feel a huge weight being lifted off of me when I pray and it’s something that I have been doing often and has most definitely been helping me. 


This is a simple prayer that we say before eating down south. I grew up hearing my grandmother say this prayer and over the years I’ve had a scant relationship with God, but no matter how far I stray God always accepts me back. I’m not religious so take that for what it’s worth. God hears all of us no matter your race, religion or past. 

I hope this helps whoever is reading this. This thing ain’t easy and it takes work. God doesn’t want us to work so hard alone when there’s such a powerful force there to help us only if we will call for help.

After a month and a half, I got great feedback about my work performance which made me realise my perception was incorrect. I’m actually good at what I do. Now it’s been a few months and I love the job. 

But I also can’t stop now. Things aren’t spiraling out of control, but I’ve lost weight, I’m underweight, and there’s no way in hell I’m letting myself gain it back or eat more again.

My dinner has always been the same, small amount of what I am allowed to eat due to health reasons. With that I usually lost a significant amount of weight during a week which I usually almost gained back during binge attacks on the weekend. So losing weight has been kind of slow lately. Maybe also because I am already underweight and losing weight gets harder with that.

Now I started to eat a breakfast too. It consists of many vegetables and a small bread with veggies on top. 

My problem is: I seem to gain weight now.
Is this normal? I don't think I am over the calories that my body needs and ever since I started eating a small breakfast I stopped with the binge episodes. (I am also still eating less than my best friend who is as tall as me but weighs twice as much as me. He eats more than me, doesn't work out and still loses weight.)

I’ve recently gotten a new job in place of my old one, and as a result I’m much more sedentary than I once was. I have 11 hour shifts where I pretty much sit and do nothing the whole time. I can feel myself gaining wait since I’m not burning the calories I used to at the other job.

I still live with me parents (can’t afford rent in my area) and I’m an only child. My dad has always made my lunch for me (as well as himself and my mom) before he leaves for work in the morning. 

Over the past few weeks, I’ve started asking him if he would put healthier snacks in my lunch such as celery, cucumbers, apples etc. in place of the unhealthier things like cookies and chips as well as having some healthier dinners (the pizza place knows our order by heart). I’ve also mentioned that I’d like to start going to Planet Fitness since it’s near my house, and would even pay for the $20 membership so my dad could come with me when I’d like to go.

Every time I’ve mentioned any of these things, my mom just gives me this look and I just know she’s looking me over to assess my weight, and then asks me why I want to make all these sudden changes to the way things have been for so long.

It has also been due to the fact that when I do eat during the day, I feel tired or heavy or unmotivated. I don’t eat lunch at work. When there are conferences, I usually leave the coworkers at the table and I go for a walk. I run every morning, usually 3 miles. My evenings usually consist of salad, chocolate, some protein.

This past week I decided to stop eating past 9. Which means I’m coming home from work at 4, eating a snack, dinner at 7, then nothing. 

All this is to say that today, I started to feel something I never have before.

So I did &amp; told her that I didn't want it &amp; as I took it off, she said ""I'll just give it to your cousin, she's fatter than you anyway"".

She said this even though she herself _*knows*_ that I am in recovery because of my weight.

I made the conscious decision to start eating again &amp; overall get better.

I don't think she knows who I am as a person (as I wear a facade) or that I, like everyone else, have feelings &amp; saying stuff like ""Now you eat like a vacuum cleaner"" is insensitive.

After she told me that comment, I literally asked her if she wanted me to go back to my old ways, to which she didn't reply.

I still have the bad habit of doing body checks. Like I'll touch certain body parts to feel the bone &amp; how the bones themselves pop out.

I'll eat when my parents do, but I tend to count the things that I ate that day with my hand &amp; if a lot of fingers are up as a result of how much I ate, I freak out.

I end up exercising for at least 30-40 minutes &amp; even if I don't burn off most of the calories that I ate, I'll still do body checks.

I know when I'm low in terms of my weight because if how certain bones stick out, plus I can't rely on a scale because it's in my mom's room, so I can't always check even if I wanted to.

Today I ate (not that much but something) &amp; I skipped dinner, saying that I was ""still full from lunch"".

My stomach is growling &amp; I hate it, but I don't really care anymore. My mom calls me fat through little comments anyway.

I know that if it gets worse again, that she won't deal with me. She never does. Even when I'm depressed she guilt trips me.

Hell, on the first week of recovery I wanted to skip dinner &amp; she guilt tripped me &amp; projected all of her anger on me in this long ass lecture.

I'm just really tired &amp; I guess I'm just using this as a form of self harm as I actually do feel fat despite being lower than the ideal weight that I should be at &amp; I'm too lazy to cover any self harm marks that I'd make on my body from my parents.

I've been eating around 1000-1200 calories a day for around four months and I don't think I will be stopping anytime soon. I see myself as overweight and have caught myself thinking about how I need to lose all that weight. In addition to eating too little, I exercise and purge, and because of those thought I'm having and tje way I act I've started to think that I may have an ED. I've always pushed these thoughts aside, because I thought (and still do think) that I am too fat and eat too much to be suffering. I wanted to tell someone that I think I may be suffering but I'm scared they will make me gain weight. But now I'm thinking that I could really use a doctor.
It feels like my body is giving up. I'm getting weaker every day, I can barely open the door to the cloakroom in my school, I have to push it with my whole body for it to budge, and I've seen others open it with no effort whatsoever. Last Thrursday, my mom had to pick me up early beacause I felt so bad I could barely stand or walk in a straight line. But the worst thing is that MY PERIOD IS FUCKING GONE.

I’m  13 and for as long as I can remember I have loved everything sweet and sugary. When we went for walks in parks you knew I would get an ice cream. When an ice cream van would park outside my primary school on hot days I was always in that queue. Every year of my life since being months old me and my parents and loads of my parents friends and kids have gone on holiday to this campsite and whenever we’ve gone me and my friends have eaten so many cake and sweets we were constantly going in there and stuffing our faces. I used to be on a netball team and an athletes team in my primary school but since starting high school my motivation for exercise stopped and I didn’t exercise at all. And I kept on eating loads of sugar entire packs of Oreos, tonnes of Jaffa cakes, doughnuts and cookies. I would also eat entire packs of fruit. So I gained weight. My parents never told me I was overweight or unnaturaly big for my age. But I felt it and I still do. So not long ago I cut sugar out of my diet completely. I now have 10-12g of oats with a bit of milk for breakfast. A small fruit pot or half a small pot of nachos. And small dinners for example a fried egg with small strips of toast. I never snack and I only drink water. My belly has gotten flatter but I still feel fat. I listen to subliminals that make face not fat and one that reduces my appetite. And I exercise a lot for example on Friday I listened to BTS for 16 minutes and the entire time I was doing sit ups with two 10 second breaks and my ribs and stomach still hurt.

2077,IamEmptyandBitter,1572146418,dno25a,"This is just a huge vent about everything

Some backstory. I’ve been overweight basically my whole life. I tried starving for the first time my freshman year of high school and lost +20lbs but then fell out of it and went back to eating. Since then I’ve continued to have a really unhealthy relationship with food, either binging or skipping meals. In August, I was very obese and disgusted with myself.

However, in August I started skipping breakfast and lunch and eating small dinners (had to eat with my family). Then in mid August I started college out of state and spiraled out of control because I was by myself and no one could make me eat. Now I eat maybe once a week and I’ve lost over 20% of my body weight. No longer obese, but still overweight. Essentially I want to lose another of what I just lost and then some.

I feel tired all the time, I have trouble sleeping, I no longer have the energy to go up two flights of stairs, etc. Also it’s like my emotions are just gone for some reason. Like I have emotions but I don’t cry or have emotional reactions to things, I think I’m just to mentally and physically exhausted from it all.

I isolate myself. I’ve made one friend here since I’ve been at college but 90% of my time is spent by myself, starving.

I’m worried about going back home for Thanksgiving break when my family sees me for the first time since losing all the weight. I have to somehow dodge birthday cake and thanksgiving meals. I’m not even sure how I want them to react. I don’t want them to find out that I’m starving myself. But at the same time what if they are supportive and congratulate me on it, completely oblivious to what I’ve been putting myself through?

Why do I do this? It’s so lonely yet I can’t stop.",I have no one to talk to about this so yeah,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dno25a/i_have_no_one_to_talk_to_about_this_so_yeah/,1572168018.0,2019-10-26 22:20:18

2086,ilikequirks,1572062403,dn8swb,"So I know the typical cause of this (from drinking water, lots of sodium intake, having your period), and usually I don't care about little differences, but this is really bothering me, and I'm trying to recover and have more 'sane' thoughts, but this unexplained weight gain is driving me literally insane and I'm falling apart (hyperventilating, panic attacks, anxiety, you name it).

&amp;#x200B;

So, recently I've been eating more. I am lucky to go to a nice school with their own eating disorder clinic for free and I have a nutritionist, medical team, and therapist at my disposal. I always count my calories and I have previously was eating wayyy too little last year (August 2018-April 2019), and then I started binging and throwing up (May 2019-August 2019) and I'm back in my restrictive phase.  H O W E V E R,  I have been eating fear foods as part of my recovery, but never at or above maintenance ( \~800-1000 calories despite being an active 5'7 female).

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, over the past three weeks, I have  gained about 10 pounds. I know the drill (making sure your calories aren't in drinks or are underestimating your calorie intake), and I am eating too little, but I am gaining so much. Just thinking about it makes me want to cry. I haven't had my period in over a week, I drink lots of water, I go to the bathroom before weighing, I factor in how much clothes weigh. I don't understand what's happening. I'm objectively at a healthy weight before and now, but I just needed to recover mentally, not with weight gain right now (I know in the future, I need to be able to get over my fear of putting on/taking off a few pounds without wanting to die or glorify it) and I. don't. understand. Is there like a term for this? Has this happened to anyone else? Am I growing a tumor? Oh and I'm not pregnant, I don't even have a boyfriend (welp). This honestly makes me not want to eat for the next week. Like now I have no will or desire to ingest any liquids or food and it's been like this for days and I still haven't lost weight, and instead have gained some. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also unrelated, but I went to my nutritionist and she weighed me, and I talk to her about not wanting to eat, and how I definitely don't eat enough, and yet when she weighed me, she started asking questions if I was on my period or had eaten anything right before aND I FEEL LIKE SUCH A FAILURE IN MY ED SHE MUST THINK I'M LYING ABOUT WHAT I EAT. But I promise and I swear and bet on my own life that I haven't eaten a lot and yet here I am. I feel like nothing is working in my life no matter how hard I try to be better.

When I finally did, in one of my rare moments of wanting to recover and be happy and live life with at least a somewhat fucking normal relationship to food, he was not at all surprised. In fact, he acted as if he’d suspected it since about the time we started dating (almost 2 years) with a response close to “ya think?”.
Oh sure, he’ll openly comment on how I have body dysmorphia when I’m looking in the mirror bordering on tears and gazing at my reflection. He’ll make comments about a woman’s weight and imply a bigger size = less loveable, and then he’ll wonder why I can’t stomach (figuratively speaking) him telling me I’m beautiful, and just believe it. 
He won’t talk about my Eating Disorder, and I don’t know why. He won’t put it out in the open, acknowledge it like it’s not breathing down my neck every. Fucking. Minute. Of every day. 
Tonight I told him I couldn’t do Thanksgiving with him this year, that I was sorry I couldn’t go, knowing it was his favorite holiday but to please just tell his parents I had a stomach bug and was unable to make it. The fattening food, the amount of it, and everyone close to me watching me, those who know and those who don’t, it would all just be too much. 
His response? “Ok.” *then a moment later* “I need to go to bed now.” And he walked to his room, closed the door. 
That was ten minutes ago. Not even a good night. 
I don’t blame him for how I am, but he’s been no help in getting better. He just sort of seems like he’s waiting for me to get better, and the whole thing is just some inconvenient “phase” for him that has left his girlfriend depressed and sexless.

2104,peeklepookle,1573107566,dstn8u,"1. Do not fear the weight gain. Even this is extremely hard for me to say because there are days where I think I look fat and unworthy
2. ALWAYS Remember why you are recovering— family, health and friendships are the most common reasons why people recover. 
3. Recovery is best done with other people that are very food positive. It is more likely that you will succeed if you eat with others that are NOT PICKY about 1. Types of food 2. Food portions, and eat “normal portions”
4. Do not be afraid of eating more. Your body was severely malnourished and needs to regain its previous status. 
5. Recovery doesn’t mean you immediately switch to eating fried and unhealthy foods, it also doesn’t mean binging on Uber healthy Low calorie foods. It means taking your time and pushing your boundaries slowly. Some days you can have fried foods, some days not. What matters is you LISTEN TO YOUR BRAIN and honour your hunger. You will encounter binge-like episodes, but that’s totally normal too. [do not purge during this period. You are not binging or losing control. You are regaining your health]
*Of course, there are exceptions to this rule if you are SEVERELY malnourished and need intensive rehabilitation 
6. Remember the extreme effects of Anorexia. Even if you are not Super skinny, have not lost your period or experience any other symptoms, THEY WILL COME EVENTUALLY. AND THEY WILL GET WORSE THE LONGER YOU LEAVE THIS PROBLEM UNTREATED
7. Do not fear failure: you cannot experience a 360 degree lifestyle change. slowly work your way into eating proper meals, then proper FDOE. 
8. Your body needs time to recover. You cannot expect to go from NOTHING to 5000 cals a day. Your stomach will not be physically able to handle it after staying in it’s shrunk state for so Long
9. Find worth in yourself. You are worth recovery and you don’t have to want be skinny anymore. You don’t have to be. 
10. Admit that you have a problem: chances are, if you’re browsing through anorexia forums all the time, you’ll be more likely to be triggered. Do yourself a favour and either BLOCK these forums, or avoid looking at their posts. You know what is best for yourself. Surround yourself with the correct energy if you are REALLY serious about recovery. &lt;I engaged in BJJ where weight training is really important. If you are pathetically light and weak you will get DEMOLISHED.&gt;
11. Bloating. An anorexic’s worst nightmare. You’ll be bloated for 1-2 months then the weight will redistribute to other areas. Personally, I was bloated for about 2-3 months before the blob mysteriously settled in other places. This will be the hardest time that you will have. 
Lastly, always push your boundaries. If you think that you are satiated enough, try taking 1,2, mouthfuls of food after that. You can do it. 

Recovery is an uphill battle and it’s never a final destination. For most, it is journey and a set of choices you have to make Everyday. Stop comparing yourself to others who skip meals here and there, they do make up for it somehow with late night snacks/other snacks/heavier meals. 
You are responsible for your own health. Persevere! It’s worth it.

My server and friend last night had a table of two girls, one of whom was absolutely TINY. If she didn’t have an ED, I’ll eat my hat. Seriously, I out loud gushed over this girl’s tiny legs and we both watched her leave. 

For context, my coworker is a bigger gal but everyone, including myself, thinks she’s hot because, well, she is! Curvy legend! But she isn’t happy with herself so she talks about her dieting tactics a lot.

I confided in her about my ED almost 2 years ago and she’s normally very supportive. But last night when I told her about a regular of ours that I heard purging in the bathroom stall next to me one night, another skinny legend, she said ohhh maybe an allergy or maybe an eating disorder?!? 

Yeah obviously a fucking eating disorder, come on. So I said “I know what’s going on, you know I know those behaviors all too well” and she said “don’t you dare, I’ll kill you if you start throwing up” and here’s the kicker...

“I said oh no, that’s not my method, lol, I hate throwing up and I’ve never really been bulimic” 

And she replied with “good because that’s way worse definitely don’t do that”

Fantastic, starving isn’t valid, I don’t “need to lose weight”, and I feel like my trust in my friend was betrayed. I did so many shots last night after that lol total fear food but I was upset.

2113,maxidad369,1573019446,dsc0jh,"Ok so here’s the deal. TLDR @ the end. 
I’ve decided; for about the 50th time, to commit to real recovery. I want to make it last this time. I want to ignore the feelings of failure that go alongside eating more, gaining weight and feeling emotions intensely again, because that’s always what slips me up. I have a good treatment team - an ED specialising dietician, weekly/fortnightly trauma therapy, an ED specialising psychiatrist and a GP who is always willing to help whatever way he can. Support wise, I think I’m set. I don’t feel ready. But I never have, and I likely never will. I recognise that. I recognise that what has allowed me to make ED related concessions in the past is allowing myself to act on impulses and urges that turn back into habits and compulsions. I acknowledge that motivation for recovery is never going to be consistent in intensity and that I’m going to have to keep pushing through regardless. 
But I’m terrified. I want to throw up even thinking about it. I’ve read countless articles and references regarding the Minnie Maud approach to recovery and, although I’m very conflicted, wary and unsure, I genuinely think it’s the best way to go.
But I’m 24. I’ve been counting calories since I was 12. Half my life. I’ve been in a constant flux of losing and then gaining and then losing weight since I was 13. I don’t know how to not control my intake. I don’t know how to trust my body. I don’t know how to accept weight gain in an outpatient setting that isn’t family based therapy. Where I am wholly accountable to myself and only myself. 
When confronted by the idea of gaining weight, none of the dreams I have for my life seem to matter as much because all I want in that moment is for the numbers to go in the other direction.
What do you guys think of Minnie Maud? How do you actually stop counting calories when it’s been your entire life for half your life? If you’re in recovery, how do you keep going despite waning motivation?
This is the first time I’m verbalising (writing, but still) my NEED to get better for GOOD this time and even now I want to backspace everything and pretend the thought hasn’t occurred to me. 

TLDR: I want to try Minnie Maud or some other kind of nutritional rehabilitation, I’ve had AN half my life now and even though I’ve researched I don’t know how to 1) start it, and 2) stick to it.

When I was in the thick of it back in high school I had a “maximum weight” that I COULD NOT allow myself to exceed. A few months ago I started going to the gym (where they have a scale... issue number 1). It’s been a long time since I’ve weighed that little, but by exercising more I realized I’m back below my old maximum. I feel weird about it and it’s been causing tons of obsessive thoughts again. I hate that I’m so excited about it and it’s making me want to bring my weight down even more.

I’ve lost all appetite I had, I hate eating even more now. I just keep thinking about how bad most of the stuff I eat is, it’s mostly snacks and junk food. I haven’t weighed myself in about a week because I’m so scared... if my weight went up I know I’ll be upset about it, and I don’t want to know if it went down because that’s a dangerously good feeling.

But y'all, I am fucking terrified. Last year my wife had a very similar pattern of relapse which ended in inpatient treatment and medical stabilization, but now that is not an option as far as I can tell. 

She has this awful voice inside her, a monsterz and it's becoming so vocal that sometimes when we talk I can see that her eating disorder is talking to me, not her. The coldness and hatred of herself is so loud and clear and it breaks my heart. I tell her every day in every way how wonderful and kind and good and worthy she is of love and of food. That she doesn't deserve to suffer. That she will still be a great student if she doesn't have an eating disorder, and that no one will judge her or think she was lying about her eating disorder once she is in recovery. (These are reminders she has asked me to vocalize in order to help her)

Y'all I feel like I do BATTLE every single day - not as much as she does, bless her, cuz that voice ain't in my head, but... I have no idea what to do. I'm a wreck. I knew when we started dating, hell I knew when I was even CONSIDERING dating her that there was a chance she could die... And I accepted that risk, and I still do.

I recovered from atypical anorexia a few months ago. It wasn’t really much of a recovery cause I was still in the mindset and didn’t have professional help.

My friend came over today and her dad was there. My dad made some comments on my weight and her dad was like “no she’s not thin, it’s just her build.” I was really taken back from this. I know I shouldn’t and he probably didn’t mean it like that. I think I’m fat, but hearing it from others just makes it more real.

I never really lost weight when I had my eating disorder but gained a lot when I recovered.  I went from 33 kg to 39 kg and I can’t really deal with the weight gain. I’ve also had trouble relapsing, when I do my body won’t let me, which is probably a good thing. But I take comments about my weight very seriously and that comment made me really think.

It started in 7th grade and I wanted to loose weight. I was 200 pounds and I did it to feel good about myself and over the summer after intense games of tag and clean eating, I managed by 8th grade weigh 138 and I was beyond happy cause that’s like impossible almost but it’s true. Everything was well especially cause everyone actually gave me attention and recognized and congratulated me. As the year went by I met or became friends with someone and he wore on me cause he tried to kill himself and was always so negative so I never slept cause I feared that his life would be taken. I eventually became obsessed with perfection for him, I felt like I needed to do everything prefect to save him, as time went by I actually met a girl and we had the worse relationship ever and the summer after 8th and during 9th she cheated on me. 9th grade was the year I definitely put weight back on but I was contempt cause hey I needed it which I wasn’t gonna lie and it was a good year cause I met a girl who I am still with named Annabelle(if I can post a pic of us, I will) last year in 10th everything went well and I thought I had it all until October in which me and my gf broke up cause I felt trapped. We made up but in the meanwhile a girl who I thought was our friend was trying to manipulate me to date her but I refused, the mistake I made was not telling my girlfriend cause she had always suspected her being fishy. She was right and December is when she found out and that absolutely tore her, the way she looked just destroyed my world and I soon became obsessed with how I looked and acted. 159 to 142 in two weeks. In Jan, I started track and I will post pics. I did the training and it was an amazing way to just get rid of those evil thoughts I had but even then I felt guilt, I felt so insecure. I thought that she would leave and it was ironic that our roles switched. Time goes by and yes things get better but over the summer I was scared of loosing progress so I ran more and ate less. I now sit at 130 pounds and I’m 6’1. My routines aren’t the best, I usually burn about 800 calories daily but my diet is apples and coffee and water. It got worse cause my girlfriend and I haven’t been having the best year, it’s hard with both of us being busy and we’ve been fighting and I hope this Monday that I can make it up, I’m going to hug her and tell her how lost I’d feel without her.

my fat ex-bff and I used to eat all the time, until the bi-ch left me. Started noticing my curves and it was okay i guess.

I wanted a tank top for a warm day, my mom told me that I shouldn’t wear what skinny people wear.

self esteem -100.

Found diets and decided to fast. No sodas, no unhealthy snacks, and definitely no sugar. Ate once a day, food is the only thing in my mind.

school starts again, I get mostly looks but some compliments.

Fat ex-bff decides she wants to hang out with me again after her new friend ditched her.
she wants to eat snacks but I tell her no.

more pounds down and she starts skinny shaming me, another fat friend starts too.

“at-least I can be happy and not melting away haha” 

“you fucking anorexia-child”

“I miss the old you who ate a whole bag of chips ”
so you miss the old fucking me? the one who basically ate her feelings and was only there to comfort your damn fat ass while you threw insults at me (which she still does)

you know i’m in fucking therapy but still decide to comment my every choice of meal.
might aswell chug down a bottle of water while you eat that vegan bigmac you tell me is “healthy.”

2164,beautifulchaos22,1572728429,dqqdpb,"Alright, so I've been relapsing pretty hard since the summer, and I've been losing pretty fast. But when I look at myself in the mirror (or any other reflective surface, let's be honest, I body check all day erryday), all I see is yuck. Just plain old yuck. I hate myself but others around me are concerned, and my psychiatrist is concerned. I'm waiting for treatment and I've been told that I'll be on a weight restoration plan during treatment (aaaaaahhhh). 

Anyways, I was out in my city the other day, and it was raining and I didn't have an umbrella (I used to live in a windy, rainy place, so I got used to just not using an umbrella, because it was useless), and I was waiting at a crosswalk, and a man with a big umbrella was beside me and held the umbrella over me (he was still under it too, it was quite a big umbrella). I said thank you, and took off when the street light changed, but honestly, I was surprised he did that. I would have thought nothing of it, as some people are just kind and want to help) but just earlier the same day, I was sitting on public transit, and got up to offer an elderly lady my seat, and she looked at me and was like ""no you sit down sweetie"". I told her it was okay, that she could sit, and thanked her, but damn. I got told to sit down by someone my grandma's age, yikes.

2187,x24throwaway,1573708262,dw4ntt,"Brief background: A few months ago I began relapsing. In terms of weight, I went from a BMI of 18.8 to 17.2 in 2 months, and I’ve been maintaining that BMI for about the last month. I think currently I would be at 17.0 but I haven’t weighed myself for a few days — I’m basing this on changes I can see. These numbers are obviously not bad. 

Now: Some people knew that I was relapsing but since I have been maintaining the same weight (by choice) I feel like they must be judging me, thinking I’m not even good at this and I don’t really have any problem and I was being melodramatic. I have been maintaining because that is a functional weight for me and I had both university study plus my job (at the uni) to perform at, but semester is over so I’m thinking this is the perfect time to continue the weight loss and train my brain to become functional at a lower point. 

Why am I doing this? Is it for a sense of achievement? I want to meet some goals. I want to be the skinniest person in the room. I want to punish my body. I want to be little. I want control. I want people to comment on my size. I’m obsessed with numbers. I want to be the one who is skinny and pretty and smart and liked, like I was as a teenager. 

I’m about to turn 25 and it’s like my mind is regressing when it comes to everything related to this fucking disease. I spent so much time in therapy and hospital as a teenager for this. I thought I would have moved completely past this by the time I was 20, at the latest. That magically, I’d have recovered completely. 

I’m also about to get a new tattoo. I love my tattoos but I wish they could be bigger, I wish I could be okay with my body being bigger so that i could get bigger tattoos. I see photos of one of the tattoo artists I have pieces by, she is gorgeous, and she is bigger than me. She looks amazing and I wish I could be her size and be okay with that.

I kind of relapsed even though i still eat normally but mentally my eating disorder is going strong. I only eat in the morning and then desperately try to stay under 700kcal. 

Anyway, i was getting ready for school and started picking my outfit for the day. I picked a skirt with leggings and a purple shirt. There isn't a day in which i don't look at my legs.. and every time i pass some kind of shop/ or anywhere i can see my reflection my eyes momentarily shoot to my legs. 

I also have body dysmorphia so thats great. The only way I can explain it - I see different versions of myself in different windows or every other day. I figured it out when in a period of two weeks I restricted a lot but would constantly see my legs fat then one day while waiting for the bus i saw my reflection and my legs looked like sticks and i lost it. I got so scared and panicked.

I've never really sought for help and I somehow manage to help myself eventually. As of right now I'm 56kg probably/163cm. 

I really liked my outfit but I started to think in my head things such as:
 "" If you get thinner it would look better."" 
"" Your face does not fit anything you wear"" 
"" You look awful"" 
"" You are ugly"" 
""Skinny legs make everything look better"" 
""If you lost weight maybe your ugly face would change"" 

.. and more nonsense.

2208,MySenpai13,1573564982,dv9wug,"I just wanted to share some ways my mum affected my ED, not in a positive way

(TW: fasting, restricting, anorexia, eating disorder, purging, implied suicidal, depression, weight loss, bmi, potentially verbally abusive comments from family(?) I shared this on tumblr already, but I might as well leave it here too) 

So, some backstory. I used to be a pretty chubby kid (like 2-5kg overweight, nothing extreme) from like 7 years old to 12. She constantly body shamed me, I can vividly remember her telling my grandmother whilst I was right there to hear it that 'this is not what girls are supposed to look like'. This caused me extreme body image issues from the young age of just 9. I can also vividly remember myself standing in front of a mirror, wishing my thighs were the size of my calves and that my waist was barely half the size of my shoulders. Not understanding the concept of weight loss, I didn't know what to do to make my mum proud of me, so I remained in self hatred for years. I learned that I have to cover up my fat legs, hide my fat stomach, and wear loose sleeves over my fat arms. I learned that I have to get changed in the corner of the PE changing room, hide my body or people would think less of me. My mum kept calculating my bmi, I remember her telling me how I need to lose 4kg. 'I want you to work on it now so you won't hate yourself later' but I hated myself then. I wouldn't have even thought of hating myself if you didn't tell me I should.

Fast forward to the age of 12/13. My first major depressive episode. I stopped eating because I literally couldn't get anything to pass through my throat, I threw everything up. I realised I was losing weight. I continued consciously. I lost 20kg in two months by eating barely one meal a week that I didn't puke up. That meal consisted of a small bowl of jelly because it was the only thing that didn't trigger me to puke. 10+ glasses of green tea a day, hiding in the bathroom to cry and calm myself. You laughing and commenting on how you didn't think I was enjoying the holiday wasn't helping either. I sat inside wrapped in a thick blanket doing crosswords in 30+ degrees celcius weather. I went down to a bmi of 14.6. You praised me. So I didn't stop starving.

A year later I went up to a bmi of 16. People in changing rooms were getting concerned, my friends tried to get me to eat. All I saw in the mirrors was fat, and that still remains.

My mum said 'you have to fucking eat or you'll get sick and you know I won't go around to doctors with you'. So you don't care? Right. I get it. First you tell me I'm gross and need to lose weight now you're telling me you won't go to a doctor with me in a tone that clearly shows you don't care. For fuck's sake. I just want your approval. I just want to make you proud.

Fast forward another year. Bmi 17, I still look scarily skinny but I don't notice it. All my life I'm being compared to my little sister, my own parents telling me to be more like her and that she's a better child than me. Now she's a spoiled ass brat, threatening to kill herself and call the police, pretending to vomit and forcing herself to hyperventilate and faint, all because she can't get some money and because I bought myself a new phone after my old one completely died. I reccomend to take her to a psychologist out of concern, I receive a telling off about how no perfect child of theirs can have a mental illness.

I started eating and gaining weight, I was at a bmi of 19 when my mum told me to eat less or I'd get fat again. I went back to restricting, she congratulated me on my smaller portions.

I did eventually get back to a bmi 24, now I'm back after my mum constantly made offhand comments about me being fat and why I can't be as skinny as my 9 year old sister. She accused me of wearing push up bras because my boobs can't be bigger than hers and told me I'm fat because I actually have a larger ass than her. We wore the same dress size, we're the same height, weighed the same. But she was oh so fit and I was oh so fat. Okay then.

I moved to my grandparents, and after some time apart we now have a slightly better relationship. I know she cares about me and she was a good mother in every aspect of parenting apart from the whole weight and mental illness thing. Now I'm back here restricting again. Sorry this vent turned out so long, but for all the parents out there who strive for your child's perfection, please, keep in mind your child is not your trophy, your child is someone you have unofficially agreed to love and raise by deciding to have them or take them in. They want to love you, but they need you to love them too. Respect goes both ways. Talk to your child, don't disregard their problems and please never criticise them on their looks or personality. Your child is not your property, they're a person with their own problems and feelings.

Posted here earlier this year, I have been healthier than before (but was never underweight) and now approaching things **by myself**.

I am also in my early twenties, so I feel a bit of resentment to myself for having this issue now. It doesn't help that this temporary psychologists says the **worst case scenarios without any plans or resolutions**. So yep - not much support. I've looked online for self-management and how to reduce anxieties with food, but it is difficult. I was wondering if anyone would have recommendations?

     I started seeing my boyfriend at the end of March, hes 22. I sort of knew him in highschool, not well, he was always very thin, always wore big sweaters. And he is seriously gorgeous, long, honey coloured hair, high cheekbones, full lips, beautiful eyes. Sweet and shy and kind. I quickly realized he is super insecure about himself, especially his body. He often asks if I think he's fat. He is FULLY CONVINCED he has a small dick but daaaamn absolutley not, not even close. I realized how thin he really is, if you tried to pinch him, you couldn't. He has almost no muscle. 
     At first I was stoked when we started hanging out because he never suggested us getting food, then I got worried because we would hang out all weekend and he wouldn't eat. Neither of us would eat, just occasionally, ""Are you hungry?"" ""No, are you?"" ""No."" Recently he came home from work at 7pm, said he had eaten already, didnt eat until he started puking up nothing the next afternoon. I stopped hiding my food issues so much and about a month ago we were drunk and I said, ""I think you have the same thing with food as I do"" and he said, ""yeah, I think I do"" and we didn't bring it up again. Lately he's been offering me food regularly and suggesting things for me to eat, which I'm sure you all know is stressful to have someone do to you. I'm having a hard time because my heart hurts for him, I want him to be healthy, I want to feed him, and at the same time I hate suggesting food because then I might have to eat too. It looks like he might be struggling with that as well, he seems nervous when he tries to give me something. 
I want to help him, I want to support him. I don't want to get better and I'm being a hypocrite.

For a couple of months until recently, I had been trying to restrict my calories to half of what they should be, and consequently I went from the upper end of the healthy BMI scale to the mid-lower end- at a pretty awful emotional price, because I started ""binge"" (eating like a regular person)- restricting. Recently, however, I've been experimenting with going vegan, and I've found that, on days when I eat purely vegan, the urge to check packets for calories disappears, and I can eat functionally. I feel guilty though, part of me feels like eating vegan is my brain's way of ""trading off"" one diordered habit for another.  Is this healthy?

so, i wish i knew how to start this off but i don’t. the beginning seems like a good place to start, so yeah. disclaimer: it’s 12:53am and i just spent too long looking at myself in the mirror after a shower. also i am very sarcastic in nature, and wouldn’t recommend reading if you’re not in for the long haul. 

i was a pretty decent kid from what my memories allow. pretty much always laughing or smiling, reading a book, playing dress up with my cat, or just simply laying on my bedroom floor and staring up at the popcorn ceiling, pointing out indescribable shapes to my imaginary friend. 

i went through some rough stuff as a kid too, don’t get me wrong, i had my fair share of “boyfriends”, “break ups” and whatever, but i also had a lot on my plate even back then. see, i was the result of an unwanted/unexpected teen pregnancy, but not your typical 16 and pregnant. my mother was 14, and my father, 13. fun eh?

sorry i use sarcasm and sardonic humor as a really bad coping method. anyways, i didn’t really know my bio dad a whole lot as a kid, only meeting him in three instances, one of which gave me a permanent burn scar on my foot and aggressive Acrophobia (fear of heights)

so anyways, my mother did as all moms do, her best. don’t get me wrong, i get my mom struggled a lot trying to juggle a kid and school and whatnot, but that lead into a whole other bout of issues pertaining me that i’ll crack into later on. 

anyways, get used to that word cause it’s a great and my favorite transition word, she found a guy with whom she later had (4) children with. not to go into tooo much detail cause i wanna remain vaguely anon on here, but he was an alcoholic, drug user, who used to frequently hit and abuse my mother or me at any opportunity seen fit. 

now, before she had gone back to this pos when i turned 8-9ish? maybe? per chance? who knows. my memories are kind of like scrambled eggs after you get done swirling ‘em. 

anyways from ages 6-8 or whatever, life was good. cut back to paragraph two. i had buried the first bout of trauma down so low that i never thought about it, until i had random flashes of vaguely discernible faces or places. 

i’m not making much sense am i? it’s alright. i don’t even know what i’m saying half the time. but anyways, cut forward to being an alright age to actually remember everything that i went through. the fights, the yelling, the smacks, the threats. all of it. 

turned me from a happy go lucky kid, to a shy, scared, and easily crying preteen, to an angry, self loathing, sadistic teenager. (psst, this is also the part of the story where my ed developed)

so my mother has always been on the petite side from doing sports as a kid, i, however, did not and am not. i am 5’2, and 150ish lbs. but when i was a teenager whoooo. top tier 👌🏼. i often got comments from my mother about my weight, my grades, my hobbies, my whatever. anything my mother could criticize, she would. 

this lead me into turning down a dark path of drinking, being out late and doing some 🧢🐭💩 (that’s supposed to be a hood, but don’t worry about it) i started to internalize a lot of things and believed the nasty things my mother was saying. 

maybe i was lazy, maybe i was fat, maybe my friends really didn’t like me, maybe i was a waste of space, maybe i did ruin her life, etc. this lead me to over obsessing on my appearance but also not caring at all. 

i would worry about my weight and not eat, but then eat so much just to spite her, honestly i did a lot of things to spite my mother for doing some of the things that she did to me, but will never take responsibility for. 

this kind of behavior lead me to developing an*rexia and bi*ge ea*ing disorder. i would hate who i was, stop eating, lose weight, get yelled at, eat until i got sick, and then hate myself all over again. it was a vicious cycle that i wish i could go back and stop myself from falling into. i fell to about 110ish pounds? and then would bounce back up to 130, back and forth as the cycle got worse and worse. 

i wish i could tell past me that drinking a whole bottle of jack to yourself in your room at midnight and crying about something that your mom said about you being your back to your stepdad in the garage below your room where she thought you wouldn’t hear wouldn’t matter once you moved out on your own, but honestly, if i could do that, past me wouldn’t of believed that i made it this far. 

i put up with so much criticism from my mother that i can’t even bare to have the lights on in the bathroom when i shower, even now as an adult, because all i can hear is her voice picking at how big my stomach is, how my thighs tough now when they didn’t used to. i can hear her brag about how small and dainty she is while telling me that i eat everything in the house and that’s why they can’t have snacks in the cabinet anymore. 

i know i’ve gotten better, i don’t binge eat anymore or skip meals, but sometimes i miss being how small i was when i had someone constantly chastising me for even existing. is it bad of me to miss that pressure on me to do better and be better? 

i look at myself in the mirror and just bring myself so down because i hate how my body looks, how i can’t wear certain clothes and feel comfortable or confident because i feel too big, how my breast are too big and hang down further than they used to, how my face is fatter now, how my hair is still too many different lengths from when i shaved it off at 3am in the downstairs bathroom of my parents house before i moved out. 

i can’t avoid my mother because i care about my younger siblings, but every time i see her i’m brought back to when i was a teen and how nothing i did was good enough or is still not enough for her.

i’m not really sure why i venting this all out online, but i think it helped to just air out my frustrations. i can’t explain to my boyfriend why i cry about a pair of pants not fitting like they used to because he just tells me that i look fine the way that i am. it just hard to want to move on from being how much of a  scared, angry, self and world hating teenager, and just be okay now as an adult. 

i know that my boyfriend means well with his comments and reassurances, but sometimes i just wish he could understand you know? but anyways this is wonderwall. 🎶

2262,kunst024,1573200214,dtcabc,"I'm fairly far in my anorexia recovery and have maintained a healthy weight for about five months now. I've been really proud of myself for cooking all my meals and trying to stay as positive about eating as possible. However, I was just put in a higher dosage of my ADHD medication and it's been suppressing my appetite a lot more than usual. The medication is something I can't change... I'm in college and my ADHD has severe emotional implication when I'm not medicated. 
Because I legitimately haven't felt hungry for the past couple of weeks, I can tell that I've lost weight. I haven't stepped on a scale to check (though I've really wanted to), but I can see my ribs and my hip bones. Just being able to feel my rib cage has been shockingly triggering for me.

- It’s like overall I know things are not going well for me and that I’m underweight and have problem behaviours, but as long as I can occasionally eat pizza and as long as I can add aoli to my half-sandwiches if I feel like it, I tell myself that means the problems are negligible.

I have been doing intermittent fasting (IF) for 65 days now, straight, no cheating. I recently discovered IF and researched the science behind this controlled way of nourishing your body and it does makes sense. 

I let my body do its thing. I do not over or under feed it. I do not binge and purge. I no longer count calories. I live on a low carb (mostly due to celiac) balanced diet/lifestyle. I eat between the hours of when I am supposed to. My body has adjusted miraculously. It’s now trained, a habitual process. I see progress in my body and mind. 

Control is a very big issue for many of us who suffer. I now control when I eat vs what I eat.  Fasting has forced me to view food in a different way. My obsessions are reduced and I’m actually feeling better overall. 

I am not promoting IF as a technique for pro-ED.

Don’t fucking tell me I can vent to you and when I actually need to vent, you dub me or you judge me or you talk to me like nothings wrong or like your problems are worse than mine so I can’t have any problems.

I fucking tell my boyfriend a couple weeks ago that I’m going to start seeing a therapist and he’s all supportive and shit and telling me that he’s there for me if I need to talk about anything. Well today I vent a little about my problem while kind of being happy that I’m trying to handle it in a healthy way and I get the most dismissive fucking response. I feel angry and sad and I’m crying because I feel like such a motherfucking idiot. Why the fuck did I actually believe him when he said that??? I don’t need him to be my fucking therapist but don’t say I can open up to you and then shut me down when I take up your offer!!

And my friend goes and does the same shit. I know she has plenty of her own troubles and I think she may have a binge eating disorder, but she’s said to me constantly that she’s always there for me if I need to vent and she’ll just listen if I need. Well twice now I’ve fucking tried to open up to her about some rough days that I just really needed to kinda vent and get a little bit of a “you got this” affirmation. Well I fucking try to open up and all she does is start talking about herself instead. And I always listen to her and let her vent to me but these couples fucking times I just needed someone to do that for me.

Nobody is obligated to be on the receiving end of someone else’s venting. I don’t feel entitled to having someone to vent to. I don’t expect anyone to be my therapist except for an actual therapist.

2289,season2episode3ga,1574240119,dyzepo,"Hi! So I thought I'd do a post on AN/EDNOS recovery since I noticed it's a hot topic and some things I wish I would have known when I started recovery! 


Background info//

I was diagnosed AN when I started recovery back in 2017(?) And have been EDNOS/recovered ever since! I'm currently eighteen turning 19 in December, my ED developed from my bipolar disorder and major depression but through working with my theripast, we have realized I am probably pre-disaposed to eating disorders and would have happened any way. 


~ Recovery isn't just a journey- it's another life


I mean this in the best AND worst way possible- people, mainly influencers say that recovery is a journey and I would like to say it's like living another life. It gets so awful sometimes and sometimes it's the best- discovering new foods/eating what I want when I can/being excited to go out new places… it's like being in a new relationship, except with food, and a toxic ex boyfriend who will sometimes say ""Aw you're having too much! You can't eat that! I don't like making that!"" And you'll just ""oh he'll go away… right?"" And he keeps belittling you! So sometimes you just have to say ""fuck OFF!"" and then the voice goes away for a bit. 

This happens over and over but eventually the voice gets smaller and smaller! And eventually you can't hear it even when you get discouraged. My point is, it's really hard and it takes a LONG time but it isn't impossible… it comes with relapses but once you start the journey again, it feels easier each time. 


~ Some days I hate myself


Even being recovered is hard, a regular person can struggle with self esteem too but for a recovered one it can be really hard- constantly holding on to my old images of me was the hardest but whenever I look back, I just have to think about how unhealthy and sad I was. How I was so dead inside and how I was so unhealthy even with my friendships. My friends love to go out with me now- it's so easy and we chat about foods we love or things we did this weekend. Not constantly focused on food and food. When I feel like I hate myself, I just hang out with a good friend until I feel better. Or lots of hugs helps too!


~ It's not me


I used to look back on photos and everything and think ""How could I do this to myself?"" And eventually I came to realize it wasn't me at that point, sure I looked like me. And I thought counting out everything and reading recipes and a food based personality was me but it wasn't. It was a disorder, someone else/something else that made me act that way. I was sick even when I didn't know it. It was like one day I kept sneezing, and everyone said to me ""maybe you should check out your sneeze? We're worried about you"" and I said ""I like my sneeze- I couldn't imagine a life without it"" and eventually I saw a doctor because I thought my sneeze maybe should be checked out and the doctor said my sneeze was killing me. I might deny my loving- always lasting sneeze might now kill me but eventually I realized it was a bigger problem than I thought and my sneeze wasn't just part of me, but a lasting illness!

2302,sadlyimstillalive,1574210699,dytx34,"I’ve noticed a lot of unhappy posts in this sub, so I decided to cheer some of y’all up by letting you know that recovery is possible! 

Long story short- I have been dealing with an ED since the age of twelve, and I am now 18. My original diagnosis was Anorexia Nervosa and my symptoms morphed into Anorexia Binge-Purge, which, needless to say, caused a FuCkToN of weight gain.

ANYHOW I began my freshman year of college this past fall and my way with coping with the stress and the transition was to be face to face the contents of my stomach every evening. It got bad enough that I called my parents crying and we formulated a plan on attack. So, for the past month and a half, my binge/purge tendencies have been gradually decreasing and with it I am finally beginning to loose the weight I gained from my abusive eating habits.  I am proud to say that today marks the fourth consecutive day that I have not thrown up, and thus is the longest I have gone in about a year and a half. 

Much love for everyone who is struggling, please hang in there. I foresee myself possibly beginning to restrict heavily especially once the purging is eradicated. 

Pro tip: don’t throw up. It’s awful. Having gone through both at different stages of my ED (and currently), Ana is bad but throwing up is 37382992 times worse- repeated abrasions to your esophagus can cause tearing and eventually your stomach acid will degenerate your teeth. It’s actually one of the worst things you could possibly do yourself.

I managed to pretty much get over all my disordered thoughts for almost a year. Until about a month ago when they all came flooding back and punched me in the face. I realised how much weight I’d gained and how my clothes looked different on me so today I decided to weigh myself .. and it actually hurt to see those numbers.

I’m 5’4 and just weighed in at 68.4kg (approx 150 lbs) 

I’m determined to go back to my old ways to lose all the weight I gained and more..  Less than a year ago I was around 55kg (121 lbs) though I wasn’t happy at that weight, I’d kill to be there now.

At one point in my life I was at 48kg (106 lbs) and I really really wanna see those numbers again! I can’t even look in the mirror anymore, it makes me so upset and frustrated just KNOWING what I currently weigh.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hi friends,

So I've been relapsing pretty fucking hard since the end of the summer, and I'm now at my lowest weight in a long time, and worse symptomatically than I was before I did Tx in the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

I've found something super weird about how people interact with me in recent weeks. I've been told by a lot of people that I look pretty sick (but I have body dysmorphia, so honestly, I can't see it, I just body check and find things I hate).

&amp;#x200B;

Now I live in a large urban centre, and it's always busy in the downtown core. When I'm out and about nowadays, people offer me seats, even at a coffee shop I ordered a...well.... it was a ""safe"" drink and the barista was kind of weird to me (not in a bad way necessarily). She was super gentle and giving me the ""oh honey"" kind of look, and made sure I could see her putting everything together for my drink. I really appreciated this though, it makes me less anxious when I can see how things are prepared if I can't do it myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it was raining a couple weeks ago, and I was standing at a busy intersection, without an umbrella, and a man was standing beside me with a big umbrella. He held the umbrella over me (he was still under it, it was massive). Honestly, I was kind of taken aback, because even though there are kind people everywhere, most of the time, people in my city can be either indifferent (just keep to themselves and aren't kind but aren't rude), or they're fucking asshats lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Also people stare at me all the time!! I catch people looking all the time, and they look away awkwardly. So weird. I've stopped looking around when on transit because I hate catching people staring.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anybody else have similar experiences? I don't know if I'm just hyper aware, or what, but I don't think this happened when I was closer to a normal BMI/normal BMI.

&amp;#x200B;

That is all. Have a lovely day, night, whatever! :)",DAE find that people treat you differently when you're underweight?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/dwhw79/dae_find_that_people_treat_you_differently_when/,1573795793.0,2019-11-14 17:29:53

They always buy highy processed, fatty, sugary, foods. If you saw them, it would not be hard to tell. Anyway growing up like that doesn't always leave you a lot of options so during middle school I started gaining weight. It was never to the point of obesity but I was pretty chubby. Of course, I didn't like to be like that but I was young and there were other things that could fullfil my lack of self esteem. Well as time progressed the things that used to fulfill me no longer did, and that's when my lack of self esteem became 10x more intensified. So of course, with the fear of judgement as my fuel, I started to exercise and eat healthy. And I have been ever since. Although, I've been eating healthy, I have not been eating a lot. A typical day for me is half a cup of oatmeal for breakfast, then chew gum during school until I get home for dinner which is whatever my family makes which is where I get the majority of my calories.

So I was reviewing my Renpho app, which is the app connected to my smart scale that tracks my weight and all my info like BMI, body fat %, body muscle %, etc and I noticed that I had lost 35 pounds total since I started tracking. 

I was thrilled about this milestone so I sent a screenshot to my mom who sees me 2+ times a week, along with a picture of myself with my cousin (we’ll call her Sara) from summer ‘18, when I was at my highest weight. I wrote all this out in the message. 

Then my mom, obviously having read nothing and only looking at the chart, responds: “good weight loss. Nice pic of you and Sara, where are you guys? Is she still with [her boyfriend]?”

So basically my mom who sees my multiple times a week thought that a picture, from 18 months and 35 pounds ago at my heaviest weight, was taken tonight. Naturally, I was really upset and tried to explain to my mom why, but she got super defensive and started screaming/playing the victim so I just dropped it. 

Later I showed my dad just to see his opinion and he said I looked “skinny” in the before picture which was obviously just him trying to diffuse the situation because I may look like a lot of things in that before picture, but “skinny” is not one of them. 

I asked my mom about it later and she said she was not interested in talking about it anymore and that I need to just get over it and stop being so sensitive. This bothered me even more because she’s constantly begging me to open up and talk to her about these things, but I often don’t want to because she acts this way. 

Honestly this is the shit that makes me anorexic and gives me body dysmorphia. When I look at the before pic I am disgusted. And she basically confirmed to me that that’s still what I look like to people even though I went from 205lbs to 170lbs at 5’9”. The only time I felt like I wasn’t fat was when I was under 140 in high school after an extreme months long caffeine pill-fueled fast. 

I know it’s probably not healthy to go back down to that weight but I can’t stand this feeling of having all the extra weight on my body and knowing that the first thing people think when they see me is “fat guy.” :(

2451,NoCreativeInput,1574439919,e039lh,"tldr; Your partner of a year tells you they are losing attraction to you because of how much you hate yourself  and make negative comments about yourself only makes you hate yourself more.

--My 1-year anniversary with my gf is tomorrow the 23. Just tonight from like 10-12pm we had a ""discussion"" 

My gf told me she has lost attraction to me because of how negative my body image is. She said that it hurts to see/hear me tear myself down all the time and I guess just shit on myself constantly ( we also live together) She says I probably don't notice how pervasive it is.

She said that she even wished she could have even been with me when I was thinner because maybe then I wouldn't have hated myself as much back then.

I have had an ED for 13 years and I have BDD. I gained over 100 pounds due to psychological meds years ago and havent been able to lose the weight.

I go to therapy 2 times a week (have been with my current therpaist for the past 3 years) and been in therpay working on my ED and body image for 13 years.

When I asked for a way to quanitfy how much attraction she has lost, 10 being the highest (as in where her attraction was when we first met) that now shes fallen to an 8.

I'm disgusted with myself. I see no way of fixing this. I've been in therapy for most of my life and truly hate my body. I AM dusgusting, I hate myself and I don't see that changing. She also said me not doing anything about it- like working out or something is what's unattractive too and I have felt so much PERSONAL guilt about that in the past and now knowing that is another reason she's attracted to me...

I recently just started a prescribed pill to help manage my weight but who knows what that will do.

I don't see how our relationship can continue. The way I see it: My body image is not going to change- yes I will continue to work my ass off in therapy but this has been my reality my whole life.I don't see how her now 8 can turn back to a 10. I challenged her and said whats the solution? Do I go to the park tomorrow and start running? Then will I be at a 9?

I just feel like I am going to be paranoid now that she will continue to lose attraction to me and she wont tell me (the only reason we had this talk tonight is because she talked about this with her therapist yesterday and I pulled it out of her--she wanted to tell me on monday after our annivesary tomorrow) and I will contantly be questioning whether shes lying to me.

And now I just feel gross. Like I don't deserve to eat, I feel sick to my stomach hours later.

She still loves me and doesnt view this as a ""relationship ruiner"" and thinks maybe she will just stay at an 8, or go back to a 10. For her its just frustrating and shes ""getting"" (as in not DONE and checked out) sick of the negative self talk.

So I want to clarify she isn’t making comments ABOUT my body ie: calling me fat or anything it’s the fact that I put myself down so much that it’s becoming too much

I want to break up now before this gets worse and she loses more attracion to me.

2469,luciangrigore,1575559932,e6ir0z,"Hello everyone,
Just went to my parents house for a couple of days, and around this place (and even time of the year) I do not care about my intake/fasting habits, etc. so a few days and meals after, I decided to measure myself. 
Note that at my own house I do not have a measuring tape, not even a scale; as these two elements are highly triggering me. 
Measuring myself, I discovered that I am a size 0 (women's), almost 00.
Felt the happiness for a bit and then an idea crossed my mind: that I should loose some weight just to make sure I look perfect.
I am 6' (182) and 121lb (55kg), and a guy, and I am confronting with weird eating habits since high school, and now I am 22. 

Do you have any wisdom that you would be so kind to share? Itight help others as well...

I am quite scared, I do not want to endanger my life. I thought loosing weight might make me feel more accepted, loved, but the only thing it offered me was distance from my friendships, family. 
I am scared of food, and going out, because I might loose control.  

Please do not engage in self-harming methods, let your body dictate you and, most importantly, do listen to it (your body).

I do not wish anybody the struggle I am going through.

(Summery : my boyfriend cheated on me bc of my labido being so low but we started to work on our relationship but my labido hasn’t gotten any better it’s to a point where when we do things I don’t really enjoy it and I dint know what to do because I love my boyfriend so much I don’t want him to cheat agin but I haven’t even started treatment yet and my ED is bigger than me right now and I’m not sure when it’ll come back) 

(For background info on me and my bf relationship)
So me and my boyfriend have been together for 3yr and some months and we have a long history of breaking up and getting back together and we don’t have a very good history of when we are together.
We’ve had a lot of downs and very little ups. We’ve worked though all the times he’s cheated and all the times I’ve talked to / where friends with people he wasn’t ok with and all that but we’ve worked though it all. 
This past year we actually started to better we didn’t do the whole break up and get back together thing we tried to work everything out. I gave up everyone in my life he didn’t want me around or to talk to I do everything I can to make him happy he doesn’t work bc if his anxiety and ive paid everything for him for the past year I love him so much I’d do anything and everything for him he makes me happier than I could have ever imagined 
(End of back ground info on the relationship)
I went though a phase in my early eating disorder where it kicked in really bad when we would break up and start to get better when we would get back together. But about 6 or 7 months ago my eating disorder kicked in really bad and because it kicked in really bad it caused problems in our relationship since I wasn’t eating as much I was more tiered and I wouldn’t go out to eat much and he didn’t know I had an eating disorder when it had kicked in so I got distant and that’s where all the problems started so he freaked out and we had to have a big sit down discussion about it and everything and I had to explain that’s why my libido was so low and things just went down from there. Since my labido was so low he wasn’t the happiest since I didn’t wanna do much and he talked me into getting help and going to inpatient treatment but I didn’t stay very long due to my anxiety and when I had got out I found out that he had cheated on me but I said to myself people make mistakes and we said we’d work on it and id get help but i had to wait a while to get into a treatment and we’ve been working on a lot where yes my labido is still very low but we talk more and figure out better solutions but my labido hasn’t gotten any better and I can tell my boyfriends getting annoied and it’s getting to a point where when the very and I mean VERY occasional time that we do have sex or something I don’t even really enjoy it like my body just doesn’t respond in a good way and I’m worried my bf will cheat agin or that I’ll be holding him back from someone who can give him something I can’t and I don’t know what to do do I be selfish or do I set him free I love him with everything in my body I love him so much I’ve givin up everything he’s asked me to and givin this relationship every single thing in me but I don’t know what to do if anyone’s ever gone though something like this and wants to spread some wisdom and advice it would be very very very much appreciated",So I’m not sure if this is my ED causing these thoughts and problems with my bf but and it’s tmi but I need some advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e6asmz/so_im_not_sure_if_this_is_my_ed_causing_these/,1575536284.0,2019-12-04 20:58:04

I'm older now and no one can actually force me to go and I am stubborn as hell so I know that I'm not about to give in to the people suggesting it, just on principle. I also wouldn't let myself go unless I was at least 5.5kg less than I was for my last admission, which was 6 years ago. I'm currently 3.5kg less. 

I don't miss that they would make me gain weight. The idea of ever gaining weight again ever again in my life terrifies me. I miss that I felt like I had permission to eat enough food though.

I’m in the mindset where if I don’t eat lunch during “lunch hours” then I can’t eat, even if I’m hungry. My logic behind it is that dinner hours will be soon, so it’ll be excessive to eat after lunch hours and then eat during dinner hours, but eating after dinner hours isn’t healthy. That’s part of why intermittent fasting was really bad for my progress.

It’s really hard to break from this mindset. I’m starving right now but my “lunch time” already passed so I’ve just been chugging coffee for energy. But that’s only making me sick and jittery now.

2490,wanderlustcub,1575418451,e5qhh1,"Hello everyone. 

I wanted to take a few moments to talk about my progress in Recovery. I want to do this because I wanted to show others who are contemplating, stressing, obsessing about Recovery some of the perspective being in the middle of it. 

 For background: I have had an Eating Disorder for most of my life. I had small episodes growing up, but when I was in my late 20's, I began a cycle of severe restriction and exercise followed by months of binging and eating, and it cycled like that until this year when I sought therapy and recovery. It has been 10 months since I started the Recovery journey. I see a therapist once a week, and I am also taking anti-anxiety medication. 

 It is not easy. Recovery is the process of un-fucking your head, and that takes time, and it takes perseverance, it takes grit, and it is messy. It is one of the hardest things I have embarked on... but it is absolutely worth it. 

The past two weeks have been the longest stretch of time since starting recovery where I haven't had a meltdown, a freakout, a setback, or examples of falling back on the ED behaviours. I have named my ED (Phi Phi), and I have gained insight on some of the why of my actions. I have also been learning the tactics and strategies to work through the ED thoughts as I get them. 

One of the biggest things for me in my recovery is that after I was out of the severe danger moment of malnutrition, is the focus on my self-esteem, my self-worth, and why I use eating as a way to punish myself for the things I feel I need punishing (mostly failure to be perfect). Also, we are starting to look into why my anxiety is presenting itself by restriction, mental self-harm, and worse. 

I have had tearful breakdowns, angry meltdowns, and I almost ""fired"" my therapist and quit ""recovery.""

Thats when I found out that you can't ""quit"" recovery. Failure is a part of progress, and there is no such thing as perfection in recovery. My therapist is an amazing woman who has the right levels of support, and ""kick me up the ass"" to cut through the ED bullshit that I sometimes spout. She has been instrumental in giving me the grace and space to tell me ""it is ok if you had a bad week."" and not to beat myself so much for it. 

The last two weeks have been really good. I am not obsessing about food, and I am being nourished, and I am comfortable with where I am. Further, while I am still a ways off on things like self-esteem, self-worth, and that negative voice in my head, I feel that I have a bigger emotional and mental cushion to address those larger issues because... well frankly... because I am not starving myself. 

Yes, I have gained weight. But I am now losing weight and doing it in a much healthier way. I went from famine... where I ate nothing. To feasting... where I ate all the decadent things I wanted to eat, followed by pure anger that I did that. Now, I am moderating my food intake in a healthy way, and my weight is slowly coming down. it is still too slow for my liking, but that is what I am working on with the therapist. I eat ""normal foods"" and I am maintaining a steady caloric intake while still exercising. 

So, does that mean I am done? Hell no. Recovery is a life long journey, and it is important to remind ourselves that it is the Journey, not the destination, that is important. I will have setbacks, but I will have many more victories, and I know that my mental outlook is part of why I will be a success. 

I know that for many here, the journey seems daunting and impossible, but I am here to tell you that each of us have the ability to beat this. When I thought of Recovery at the beginning, I could only see an impossible destination that I could never hope to achieve  - happiness. That is what the ED told me. But now, I see recovery as the process of addressing my insecurities, my anxieties, and my disordered eating in a way that makes me a better person to myself and the people around me. Happiness is not the destination, it is found during the journey. 

My husband and I have a cute shorthand on my ED thoughts. I will tell him if ""I am having an overcast day"" which means that the ED thoughts are loud, and they are covering the person I am underneath. On an overcast day, all I think about is the ED, the food, the weight, the numbers, the anxiety. Partly Cloudly is where I am managing the thoughts, but they are persistent. 

The last few days have been clear blue skies, (and the accompanying song also helps heaps).

2501,shelly_cttncndy,1575361165,e5e2a6,"So here is my story:
I always were to skinny. When I was born my mother had to feed me every 2 hours for me not to die. She managed to get me out of that so I grew up fairly normal (like 1,30m; 25kg).

It all started when I moved class in 9th grade. I became friends with those cringe girls all claiming about being so depressed, having really bad depression. I wanted to help them since I was a pretty positive little girl. So I started helping out. With time I learned how toxic they were. They wouldn't appreciate what I did for them and I would feel really bad about it.

I got problems in school due to my poor health (I have a verry low imunsystem which makes me ill like 80% of all times) and stayed up long just to study for finishing the class. So i started skipping meals. At that time i found out only one of these girls were in therapy for having depression. The other ones never even were at a hospital to find out! But i honestly didn't care. 

When I had more free time these days I tried to live my normal life. I learned pretty soon that i couldn't eat like I did before. I told myself its because of how stressed I am.

When my weight started to get down drasticaly I reached out for help. I sat in front of them, crying that I couldn't eat anymore and that I'm scared. They laughed, told me it's just because they were so ill, so I want to be ill too! They said i should stop pretending I couldn't eat and just eat my stuff instead of leaving it in the lunchbox.

It went downhill. I lost so much weight (1,65m; 30kg) in just a few months. There came a day where I was at a convetion, collapsed because of the fact I didn't drank or eat for a few day except for a few stuff i was forced to which i could barely held in. 

They moved me to a hospital, a friend of mine ( not involved with the group) came with me and made clear I should get help. So I did. It got better. I got into a hospital again for rehabilation a few months before and since then I'm kind of in a healty weight!

I'm currently trying to go back to how I was before everything went to shit by doing Keto and working out. However, my dad keeps making snide comments about my weight and it keeps pushing me into old habits that I thought I got over. I didn't eat for two days straight because I felt so ashamed. I ate today and I feel horrible for it, I easily had over my allowed amount of net carbs. I also exercise 3 days a week at the gym, and I've been exercising myself into calorie deficiency. It's like a tug of war between systems right now. Giving into the temptation of eating and the temptations of starving at the same time. 

So I've been considering purging. I hate puking but I'm getting deeper and deeper into this pit of despair. My stepmom just made cookies, I know in going to eat them, I won't be able to control myself. But I'm scared about what I will do after. My dad's voice keeps ringing in my head on repeat.

2516,SlippSlopp,1575279706,e4wt0t,"Well guys, I never thought this would happen. My anorexia journey started when I was 12, and lasted until my very last relapse at 16. I’m 20 now...I’ve had 4 good, normal, healthy years. I’ completely moved on from even identifying as someone who ever even had a eating disorder. 

But recently, my best friend who lives 700 miles away from me, fell into anorexia for the first time. Within a few months she’s evidently gotten very ill. Its been interesting hearing someone tell me the same excuses that I used to say myself.....it was like talking to myself from the past. But honest to god, hearing her vent about it and seeing her social media photos didn’t give me any thought of relapsing. Until she came to visit me last month, and I saw her in person. And saw her eating habits. Literally within 10 minutes of being at my apartment she almost fainted. 

This has completely fucked with me. On top of all this happening, I’ve been having money issues, and I’m stressed about rationing food to get to my next paycheck. Essentially....I feel myself starting to relapse. I’m eating like 1/4 of what I’m normally eat. I haven’t advanced so far as to have fear foods, or to limit myself to a certain amount of calories, but it’s like I’ve just lost the urge to eat. I find myself fantasizing about all my old tricks to ward off hunger. 

I feel so hopeless. How did this happen? How is this happening? I thought I had moved on from this phase of my life. Has anyone here relapsed after such a long time recovered?",I’ve been recovered for 4 years...and I’m relapsing,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e4wt0t/ive_been_recovered_for_4_yearsand_im_relapsing/,1575301306.0,2019-12-02 03:41:46
2517,bubblyqueer,1575270864,e4vgj9,"I’ve lived with this for 8 years. My therapist and dietitian both remind me weekly that I could die. I would reluctantly nod my head and just brush it off. My best friend has reminded me over and over that I only have one kidney and I need to be careful. I kept saying that I don’t care and I’d rather let anorexia kill me. I hate living. I hate my body. I hate that no matter how good my life appears to be, I can’t be happy. I don’t know how. I hate feeling this way. Being alive is exhausting and seems pointless. I’m 23 and I’ve been suicidal since I was 12 and had an eating disorder since I was 15. Recently diagnosed with anorexia. My mind tells me I even fail at that. In my twisted perception, I should only be eating xxx calories and exercising at least an hour daily and if I’m not meeting those impossible standards, I’m a failure. Even if I do, I could always do more. I can always eat less, exercise more, weigh less, etc. I work full time and do school full time so I run out of time and tell myself daily that I’m a failure, I eat too much, I have no self control. There’s been times in the last 8 years where I wasn’t actively restricting and I thought I had it under control. But I was only eating like twice a day and still thinking constantly food. I was still telling myself I was a failure for eating. Still hating my body and wishing I could rip my skin off. I hate living with this and feeling this way. I feel worthless and that I’ll never achieve anything. It’s so much easier to just give in to my disorder. I know I’ll die, but for the longest time, I didn’t care. I had a sort of wake up call. I was coloring with some of my kinder students. I realized from talking about skin color with crayons how discolored my hand is. My nails are blue, my knuckles are blue, and the rest of my hands are dry and red. They aren’t the peachy white that they should be. They’re cold. I get told all the time how cold my skin feels. I say I’ve always been that way but I haven’t. I always thought my nails looked blue but I’d tell myself it wasn’t as bad as I thought. But I took me seeing my hand next to a 5 year old to realize how sick I am. I went home and had a panic attack, terrified that I’m going to die. Because it’s true. None of this “oh I might die” bs. It’s either I get over this or I die in my 20s and never get to experience life beyond hating myself and thinking everyday that I should give up and I’m going to reach my breaking point. I have had bladder issues for the past 4ish years. I have always dismissed it but now I’m terrified. I hate thinking about all the damage I’ve done to my body by hating myself so much. I don’t want to die. I thought I did but I don’t. I don’t want to feel the way I feel and the only means I saw for that was death. They tell me that eating and fighting this will bring happiness and maybe they are right. Maybe I won’t be so miserable all of the time. I’m trying to fight this but I don’t know how. It’s hard to convince myself that eating will not destroy me or make me any less valuable. It’s hard to eat. I hate the anxiety. I want to live. I don’t know why it’s so hard. I don’t know why I can’t just listen to my therapist and my dietitian. But I’m trying. And I really hope I can come out on the other side. I’m sick of this. I’m sick of simply existing not believing anything positive people say about me. I’m sick of hating myself and getting anxiety anytime someone mentions any function that could possibly involve food.

Hi. My name is AnorexicFigureSkater and I’m 15 years old. I’ve been struggling with an Ed since eighth grade changing from anorexia to BED. After a month of practically binge eating, I have gone back to hating my body after all of the damage I have done to it. I’m 5ft and weighed 95lbs last month only to found out I gained 10 last week. I am now exactly 100lbs after now restricting my calories and have more body dysmorphia than I ever have had before. I am now trying to loose weight until I become underweight again (my lowest weight was 82lbs).
This may be for many reasons but one of them is because I just got a new boyfriend, hell my first real one. He said that when we see each other on Monday, after not seeing each other for a week, he’d pick me up. He also asked how much I weighed so he’d “be prepared.” I don’t want him to not be able to pick me up or judge me by my weight (after thanksgiving and the excessive binge eating lol).
Why can’t I just be a normal person and eat normal without caring about what I look like?

I've struggled with severe anorexia and bulimia since I was 14 years old (I'm 20 now) -- When I was 16 I was sent to a facility for 6 months, I convinced my parents to get me discharged AMA and then got sent back a week later for almost a year. I ""recovered"" while I was there and discharged, and things were okay for a while.

In the beginning I was doing well with it, but since 2016 it has is becoming harder and harder as the days go by, I've had such good control on my thoughts, but here recently I feel myself slowly losing control.

2529,Pyromania-Bookish,1575177159,e4b4x5,Over the past week I’ve been drinking a lot of water. It’s prolly considered too much but I found something that really helps get rid of the food that you eat. It’s a well known fact that drinking a certain amount of water helps get the nasty shit outta your system. I’ve found that it also helps get food outta your system as well. Drinking a lot of water after eating speeds up the digestion process by a lot. And I mean a lot. Drinking several bottles of water after you eat forces your stomach to accommodate for the amount of water that you have just drank. This means that whatever you ate gets sent through your system way faster. It causes some pressure in your stomach if you’d don’t do it often but you’ll know when you’ve gotten all the food out when there is no more discomfort in your midsection. And you don’t have to worry about water weight because the water goes straight through your stomach within twenty to thirty minutes. I did this after thanksgiving and it worked extremely well. The amount of water that you need to consume depends on how much you ate. The more you eat the more water is needed in order to get it through your digestive system. And afterwards there are no cravings or pains just comfort.,Ughh thanksgiving,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e4b4x5/ughh_thanksgiving/,1575198759.0,2019-11-30 23:12:39

Last night I was going through an intense depressive episode, and so I ate. A lot. I kept eating until my stomach hurt. I think I ate somewhere around 1,000-1,200 in excess calories, which shouldn't really concern me I guess because I can ""afford"" it, but I'm scared I'll gain it all in my waistline/stomach and that's the last thing I want to do. I ate mostly (greek) yogurt, peanut butter, some cereal and granola (with almond milk), and a bunch of potato chips with sour cream dip, so not really healthy. I did some research and apparently, unless you're eating all healthy food, this excess will become visceral fat and make me gain all stomach fat instead of distributing it evenly.

So now I'm panicking. I plan to eat no more than 1,000 calories for the next three days-- two of which I will be working out, probably around 45 mins or so of elevated heart rate-- with no junkfood whatsoever or anything moderately unhealthy for the next five.

Months ago, around September (maybe a bit earlier) I started feeling guilty after eating.

Slowly but surely I made that limit less calories and now I do between 400 and 500 a day. I've gone for about 2 months like that. Realistically I know I'm not fat, but I can't shake the feeling of shame when I feel my thighs jiggle even a bit.

2581,86FlipFlop86,1575965319,e8nu11,"TRIGGER WARNING: NUMBERS 

I’m 20 now, but when I was 13-16 I had a pretty bad stint of anorexia. Not bad enough to be hospitalized or anything, but I was 5’1 and bounced around between 93-88 pounds for a while. I was losing my hair, waking up in the middle of the night with my feet cramped up, blacking out, you know the drill. 

Well, I recovered overtime because my dad forced me to eat and my mind eventually healed as well. I had no relapses for 4 entire years. I even stopped considering myself to be someone with anorexia. I moved on with my life. 

I think two things have triggered my relapse. I hadn’t weighed myself for almost the whole 4 years, and about three months ago I was weight at the doctors and overheard the number, and it was lower than I had estimated. I think that little hit of dopamine was kinda detrimental, like when gamblers win and get hooked. It hooked me right back into the anorexic mindset, but I tried to ignore it. 

And then recently, I got news that my old friend from high school was hospitalized from anorexia. I didn’t think much of it, but then about a month later I was back home from college and we reconnected at a party and hung out for a few days. I didn’t realize it at the time but looking back, it triggered the fuck out of me. Just seeing her do the typical anorexic mannerisms around food and seeing how thin she was put me right back in that mindset. 

And now, for the past two or so weeks, I’ve totally fucking relapsed. I’m pretty upset with myself because like, come on, I thought I was over this. I thought I had finally grown up and moved on. But for the past two weeks I’ve only been eating like 400 calories a day. I’m not even counting calories, just basically eating one snack a day and being scared of anything else. I’ve become so scared of food that even if I smoke weed i can’t eat munchies. I feel like a total fucking failure. I really don’t know what to do. 

And so many of my friends have shared their eating disorder experiences with me over the past four years, and now I feel like I have no one to talk to cuz I’m scared of triggering someone the way my friend triggered me.",Relapsing after 4 years!,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/e8nu11/relapsing_after_4_years/,1575986919.0,2019-12-10 02:08:39

Fast forward to two years ago I said fuck it and started exercising regularly. I felt good. Even though I wasn't losing weight I wasn't gaining any which was a first for me at 16 years. I only stopped exercising after I got really sick. Fast forward a few more months I was in the ICU as it turned out I had type 1 diabetes. I had had a complication which meant that i just instantly shed a ton of weight. I used to be about 90 kilograms (for reference I'm 5'11, 6ish) after the matter I maxed the scale at 68. For a few months after I was just getting back into the flow of things. I still wasn't mentally happy maybe even worse off. My sister goes to UPenn and I had been aiming for Harvard. In the span of 6 months I went from being the best to knowing dog shit in my classes because due to my illness I had to skip so many

The only thing that made me happy was when people commented on how I had lost weight and I looked good. The Doctors said that for the first year they would suggest against exercise as I frequently experience hypoglycemia. The thing is injectable insulin also causes a bit of weight gain. So as time went on I started to gain weight again. It wasn't anything dramatic just a kilogram. But I felt that it was I integral that I remain thin.

That was 6 months ago. Since then everyday I have been eating &lt;1200 calories a day. Even when I do eat I feel extremely guilty. To the point I start having suicidal thoughts

Currently taking: iron pills every once in a while, no medical condition, my mom is just paranoid about my vegetarian diet.

Previous diagnoses: went to a therapist for a while for suicidal thoughts, low self esteem, and depression. Also think I might have dysmorphia/dysphoria. 

I’ve always been obsessed with losing weight, and go to long measures to do it. A few months ago I decided to fast for two days for weight loss, and I also have a pretty big hate of my own body and face. 

Recently, I’ve been doing lots of exercise and have been counting and severely restricting calories. I’m also ashamed to eat in public and try to burn off every calorie I eat. I also have the urge to be underweight (current BMI is 16.5, want to get down to 14). I also think I’m pretty overweight, which is probably true, but everyone else is saying I’m too skinny.

I know this isn’t very reliable, but I also did one of those anorexia quizzes, and answered yes to every question apart from eating food in secret (quiz diagnosis was anorexia)

Anorexia is more common in women than in men though, so I’m not entirely sure.

Recently, I found myself (yet again) avoiding social interactions at all costs. I told most of the people that wanted to spend time with me that I was very busy, studying for finals, but that's just a lie. 

I'm scared to hang out with people because I don't want to wear anything else besides the gigantic old gray cotton shirt that I wear every day. I don't wanna wear clothes that display my body, and I don't want to caught my reflection looking disgusting on any surface. 

I don't wanna go to dates in fancy coffee places and just ask for a small espresso while my date eats just whatever they want without the gut wrenching guilt that I feel every time I eat something that has ""too many calories"" 

People is starting to grow tired of me avoiding them, and I can't gather the courage to say that I'm succumbing a big ED relapse 'cause I gained a bit of weight in the last mont, that feels like such a bullshit excuse to cut out of my life so many people.

She was asking if she should get her friends Christmas gifts and I suggested she make something like cookies for her friends that weren’t her “besties”. She said something like “Ana* doesn’t like sweets” and I said she doesn’t like sweets? And she said “well she doesn’t eat them she’s always dieting” so I asked her what she meant and she said her friend (also 11) was constantly telling her she was “dieting” and wouldn’t eat anything during lunch. I asked her if she ever offered her something and she said she purposefully only packed a banana for lunch and that her mom thinks she packs more. This made me really worried, I’ve never met this girl and this was just one convo with my sister but it sounded like bad news. I told her to encourage her to eat and told my sister a little about how some girls her age will sometimes try to not eat and it can seriously hurt their health (she’s a little naive and immature so I tried to simplify it and kind of give her some extreme examples so she knew the severity). And that that doesn’t sound good for her, and she was saying that in health class they were learning that so that’s at least good. First, is it appropriate to suggest to my little sister to take some sort of action like speak to her about it or get more info, and second what can I even do? Also
My sister isn’t the most confident and she’s emerging into puberty with a little more weight than the average girl her age. Can seeing another close peer start down this path “inspire” young girls?

My brother has never been underweight or acted in eating disorder behaviour from what anybody has seen, but he constantly makes jokes about him being on diets or being bulimic etc. For example, mom will ask him if he wants any leftover dinner after he's eaten, and he'll say: ""no thank you, I'm an anorexic now mom"" as if it's funny, and everybody laughs. He does it all the time, and he's aware of my past situation (although not to the extent, he's not aware of me taking pills for weight loss etc. Just that I was underweight and happy about it). My whole family made comments about my weight at the time, and some family members were aware it was anorexia, and it's also most likely that he was told. He continues to make these jokes and comments about his weight and calories in food etc. He's a joker, and it's become part of his 'routine' that everybody knows him for. Tonight he put on the story of karen carpenter who died of anorexia for us to watch, and against my better judgement, I decided to watch it. I'm now in the headspace again, and I decided to try and fight it and got a pizza out the freezer to eat. I offered my brother some, and he sang ""why do birds suddenly appear"", a Karen Carpenter song, and said he wasnt going to have any because he's ""going to lose half a stone"". My disordered thoughts took over and I put the pizza back in the freezer even though I was hungry. This is not a subject I can address to family, but I cannot take his 'jokes' anymore. He is not anorexic. He is feeding into my eating disorder and did all through my bad period, I'm having an especially difficult time atm and it's been triggering my unhealthy thoughts anyway. I have said things in the past about skipping meals and stuff to him, something he does not do, and he has replied ""yeah girl, get them collar bones"" and stuff like that. At the time, I didnt realise how bad that was and it would encourage me. I cannot take this anymore, and hes been making these jokes for years, it's his 'thing', he's not going to stop. I don't know what to do.

2629,strawberry_leaves,1575680230,e77h8i,I think I may have anorexia. Years ago I was very worried about becoming obese even tho I was very thin. I was also ocd I think constantly washing my hands and only eating “clean” foods I was only like 11 years old. I would look in the mirror and think I was huge and I had an irrational fear of becoming huge. I mean this sickening horrified feeling that I had no control. I also must have been delusional but this snowballed into extremely restrictive eating for a few years. Anyway somehow I recovered from this and haven’t had any issues with it or ocd since until this past year and I’m 28 now. I accidentally lost a lot of weight and am underweight. At first I was worried about my health but after seeing family and everyone’s comments on my weight loss I’m feeling very triggered. And I can feel the obsessive thoughts creeping back in that I haven’t had in so long. Also I’m feeling a bit delusional because I feel in my body that I am thick and have gained weight and then I got on a scale and I had actually lost weight.

Well, back I August I broke up with my boyfriend and it sent me in a complete downwards spiral. I lost about 35 pounds in 2-3 months. 

Anyway, my parents, family, and friends are all concerned for my health and I guess I am a little too. I want to get better, but I don't know exactly how to at this point.

Currently I have an amazing opportunity to go inpatient at a research facility, and bc I would be participating in the research, my treatment would be completely free. Awesome Right? Not quite.

The fact that she wants me to gain #1 freaks me out, and #2 really pisses me off.

2639,Tight_Radish,1575613433,e6uuqs,"I've never been able to open up to a romantic partner about my history with an eating disorder before. When I was younger, I'd always tell the guys I was seeing that I ate earlier, or just wasn't hungry-- something along the lines of that. It always came with an awkward dynamic since every guy I've ever dated has been the large, athletic type who can eat 3x his weight in food in a single sitting, yet I constantly refused to eat around them, or would lie to them about whether or not I was eating.  


In the last couple of years, I found myself in a relatively safe stage-- I do not restrict what I eat, I have a healthy relationship with exercise, and I can finally eat in public and around other people, including the guys I date. My only slip ups have been when I felt as if I was losing control in certain aspects of my life, when it would creep up on me without my knowledge, i.e. losing 18lbs in 3 weeks because I felt that my ex could not prioritize me in any way.  


I've been seeing this guy for a few months now and we have wonderful open, non-judgmental conversations about everything. When he was prying to understand why my relationship with my mother was so rocky, I blurted out that she was the root of my eating disorder. He took it well, as if he had experience with it; he did well to avoid any statements that could've been triggering. Before opening up, I never felt self-conscious or unworthy with him. Early on, I remember him saying something about how my ribs poke out, which led to a conversation about me wanting to work on more muscle definition on my stomach, followed by him saying something along the lines of how he's more attracted to some curviness. It didn't put the thought in my head that he sees me as ""curvy,"" if anything it meant that I was smaller than his normal type. We spend a lot of days + nights together, three meals a day, and I never had an issue with that before.  


It's like as soon as the ""I weighed 90lbs in my freshman year of high school,"" (30 pounds less than I do now) came out of my mouth, I wanted to be 90lbs again. I haven't fallen back into active restriction or excessive exercising again yet, but it's following a similar pattern. First, I want to look at every thin person I see. I want to connect with other people with eating disorders. I start weighing myself three times a day. Then I start feeling guilty about what I've eaten, and I lose my appetite for days at a time. I don't sleep.  


The comment from my mother that started it all was, ""when I was your age, I weighed \[x amount\] less than you. And I was taller and tanner. Much better looking.""   
Today, after grabbing lunch with my friend (my first meal in two days, still with little appetite), she looked at me and told me I was starting to look really small, much thinner than when she met me two years ago. I relished that compliment. I went home, purged the 1/3 of my lunch I ate, weighed myself, and set an alarm for the gym in the morning. I took before pictures, after comparing myself to pictures of smaller girls online.   


I can feel myself starting to go down the slippery slope again, and I don't want to, but I also do. I've come so far in seven years and I've gotten comfortable with my body and comfortable with eating, but now I can't seem to focus on the progress I've made, and can only think of the progress I *can make* if I listen to my brain.   


I like to think I'm someone with a lot of self-control and a strong sense of self-awareness, but for the first time in years I'm now losing control over this one small part of me because I felt comfortable enough to open up to someone. I don't know what to do with myself. On one hand, I can try to resist those urges but risk doubling down in the future if/when I inevitably cave. On the other, I feel like if I indulge the old tendencies for a bit, perhaps I can gain control over it again.

2646,Kitty91998,1575574428,e6m8tu,"Just something I wanted to share-
I think I decided that I want to TRY to recover. This isn’t my first battle with anorexia, as I was first diagnosed when I was 12. I have also been hospitalized for bulimia when I was 14. 
I relapsed again 5 months ago, and it’s now at the point that my whole life is falling apart. 
Two days ago, in the same day:
-My therapist told me she wants me to go into residential and that I’m going to die. 
-my boyfriend told me he that he can’t do this anymore. He can’t watch me kill myself. That he is not even worried anymore, he’s scared every single time he sees me. 
Unfortunately, my family doesn’t see this to be as serious as an issue as they do, so they haven’t been a factor in my decision to attempt recover. 
But-my boyfriend-he has loved me like no one else ever has. He has tried to help in every way. We have already worked through so many difficult things together. But this has been the breaking point for him. To see the fear in his eyes-welling up with tears-
It killed me. I couldn’t do it. 
I have never thought it was possible for someone to love me as much as he loves me. 
I tried to sabotage this relationship by telling myself he would love me more if I was skinny, because it’s difficult for me to believe that anyone truly loves and cares about me. 
I asked him what he liked about me when we first met, and the list was long, one that included traits like intelligence, radiance, self-reliance, diligence, compassion...
I have lost all of these traits that everyone loved about me because of this damn eating disorder. I am a shell of myself. Hearing him vocalize all of that really helped put things into perspective-it helped me realize how much of myself I have truly lost. 
He held me for a very long time, and I started crying-
And he said, “I just want my (my name) back”
It was in that moment that I decided I can’t do this anymore. As much as I want to-but I’m combating the thoughts one by one.
I ate yesterday, and I was SO proud of myself. Then I woke up this morning and I said that I was going to fast for 7 days. 
I really, really, want to. Because a huge part of me is in love with this horrid eating disorder too. But one day at a time. I’m going to try and eat something small and not go and exercise at the gym for 3 hours. I picked up some yarn and needles at the craft store and I started knitting again. I’m going to try, because I can’t lose everyone that loves me before I end up dying. I’m going to end up dying alone if this continues. And I am lucky enough to actually have people who care. 
I think I’m even going to make a super impulsive decision and get an eating disorder recovery symbol tattoo. Perhaps if it’s inked on my body I will feel more of an obligation to get better. 
I’m going to try, at the very least. I’ve recovered before. I can do it again somehow. 
You can all do it too. 
We are all so much more than this. We deserve more than dying. I know that is very difficult to believe-
But we ARE all capable. 
We ALL deserve to be loved. The people that truly love is will NOT care about our appearance. That’s a pretty shallow way to judge people-so why should we continue to judge ourselves like that? 
If others don’t deserve that, we don’t either. 
If you guys would like, and are willing, maybe you can all list some traits about yourselves in the comments that you valued about yourself before your eating disorder. Or even things that you still like about yourself now (excluding anything to do with weight)

(5’4 108lbs) 
So over the last two weeks my ED behaviors have escalated. I went from eating once a day, to once every two days (not every other day- every TWO days) 
In the past I’d be happy after eating a single meal because I could finally justify eating! Now I want to vomit (and often do if I’m at home). 

I feel so awful. I hadn’t eaten since Sunday (currently Wednesday), and just broke my fast with about 500-600 calories of rice, curry, and bread. 

I was wondering if anyone had any resources that could help me deconstruct this mindset and behavior on my own? Any google search I do just gives me the same 10 lines about what anorexia is. 
So any paper or blog that mentions the levels of anorexic behavior, starvation, etc would be really helpful.

2741,Justin2342,1576241247,ea3kdp,"I wasn't diagnosed because I was told I wasn't bad enough to have anorexia or an eating disorder in general (plus for not losing weight). So it's gotten me to wonder: what's it mean to be anorexic? I've starved myself, restricted food, counted calories, checked the scale, think I'm fat, have thoughts like an anorexic, and so forth. How bad do you have to be until you are considered anorexic or even for starters, having an eating disorder?   


I was also wondering if eating happens when you're anorexic. I've seen ED memes where people say they're planning on restricting food but then end up eating (how they hate themselves for eating). It's never binging, but like you eat something (small, perhaps, but still ate). Can you eat snacks or even a meal and still be anorexic? Is it the thought process, behaviors, or both that make you anorexic? Can they be separated (ex: thought process but not committing the behaviors)?   


Thank you in advance for your replies. I've been questioning this for a long time ever since people say I must have an eating disorder with the way I am functioning (whether it be the thought process or behaviors) but then my therapist said I wasn't bad enough and due to not losing weight, I can't have an eating disorder. I relate to many anorexics and have made edits about it to vent or express how I feel.

2743,rotten_maevv,1576215869,e9zwzs,"I thought I'd share the experience I had the other day bc it scared the shit out of me and I want people to be aware. My baby was in the hospital bc of the stomach bug (he was born with his intestines outside and had multiple tummy surgeries after birth. He was admitted to make sure it wasn't anything more than the stomach bug with some tests). When I'm stressed my anorexia kicks in 100% and I can't eat anything. So of course this situation has me worried and I stop eating. After 2 days of no food, with weeks of eating &lt;500 calories beforehand, I woke up for my childs blood draw at 7am. After they were done and he stopped crying a nurse told me she would change his outfit bc there was some blood on it. At this point I started to feel dizzy. I sat on the bed with my head between my legs and suddenly felt like I was going to throw up. I grabbed my water cup and walked to the bathroom where I'm not sure if I collapsed or laid myself down. I was on the floor and couldn't see, hear, or feel anything except my shoulder. I could still think and was wondering why my shoulder was shaking and slamming into the ground. After some time (I'm still not sure how long) I sat up and told the nurse that was with my son that I blacked out. She sent an attending on the floor to our room and some ER nurses came with a stretcher. After doing vitals and explaining what happened, the attending told me it sounded like my blood pressure dropped so low, my body made me have a seizure to save me. They wanted to do a CT scan and an ekg but I denied medical treatment. I know they would've hospitalized me after seeing my weight/bmi and after testing my blood. I've never had seizures before and didn't know this could even happen. It really scared me, especially since juice wrld died the morning before, after he had a seizure. 
TLDR; after eating very little for a few weeks and then not at all for 2 days, my blood pressure dropped so low causing my body to have a seizure to save me.

2748,lowkeyysad_af,1576188436,e9ugqm,"So, during more recent years, my mental health has plummeted... I don't want to bore you, but the only way to explain it is by a little backstory:

So I'm a middle child of 5, and I always had low self esteem, with high expectations, which I always tried to surpass, never looking at what I have achieved, but rather, what I could've done better.. granted, this was manipulated by people but that's not the point.

My eldest sister, since a young age, has always hit or threatened us to do as she pleased. My parents don't know about this because we are too scared to tell them.

As we grew older, I became closer to one of my sisters, because she helped me whenever I felt scared. But my eldest sister always tried to turn us against each other, lying about what the other one has said and making up BS, in the end, I would ask my sister if she actually said that, and she would tell me that she didn't, and we would make up .

Now, most recently, she always invalidates whatever I am doing, telling me that ""some people have it worse"" ""if you have an eating disorder, then what do I have?"" ""You know about calories, why don't you help me lose weight?"" ""I used to self harm, but I cut much deeper than you""(which is a lie) 

Today, she pressured me into tutoring a student, and my perfectionist self told me that I can't do it because it wouldn't be my best, as it was crammed in the middle of others, she swore at me and told me that I'm embarrassing her and that I'm unprofessional and a failure, and that I'm not good enough.

I'm too scared to see her now.

I really struggled with Rex, the ED voice in my head, today. He kept me in check constantly, telling me I wasn't allowed to enjoy Christmas. He also told me that stepping an inch outside of my routine was going to mean I would lose a mile (and all control). At one point his bully tactics completely overwhelmed me so much that I lost it, breaking down emotionally in front of my family. Thankfully they were supportive. But the shame and guilt this has left me with tonight is nauseous.

This (what I know is) irrational thinking completely conflicts with the inner child in me that really wants me to have a Christmas like he remembers, where nothing was off-limits or second guessed, and where any childlike behaviours were ok. Where he could be himself.

So if you had a rough day today, just know you weren't alone. Your experiences and thoughts were unique to you, but you had brothers and sisters around the world who know how you felt. They felt it too. And they are thinking about you now. I'm one of the them.

Can anyone relate?

I did not eat normally as a child, even though I was not a picky eater. My mom used to tell me that she couldn't even get me to breast feed as an infant. That she could get me to if she drank a glass of wine first or I would accept one specific type of formula. My aunt told me that when I moved to solid food and she was taking care of me for the summer she couldn't get me to eat anything until one of the Elders in my community told her I was a different kind of baby and I struggled with food, that she was giving me too many different things on my plate at once and that was causing me distress. As a baby. So she started feeding me smaller amounts at a time and only 1 type of food on my plate at a time and she finally got me to eat. When I was in early elementary school I remember giving distributing all my snacks to all my friends at snack time, and feeling noticably angry that I had to take a break from my school work and l felt uncomfortable that everyone was eating around me. I remember never finishing my school lunch even though I got free lunch at an inner city public school so needless to say, the portions were like the bare minimum with little variety. Still in early elementary school I would bake pies in the summertime from berries I grew myself in my garden. I would spend hours and make them extravagant. I would only ever take a small bit of it to make sure it turned out ok because I wanted my family to enjoy it. I would watch cooking shows in my basement by myself with the lights off all day and not eating anything, I wouldn't even think about eating even though I was watching shows about food. I think I was more interested in the chemistry of cooking, the chemical reactions involved when you combine different elements and add heat to them and what it does to their structure. Food was an abstract concept to me that didn't relate to eating in my mind. I also want to mention that I grew up in a low income, and  as the oldest I would be responsible for feeding my siblings, and usually several other kids from the neighborhood who would come over after school while our parents were still working their long shifts as we couldn't afford daycare or babysitters and would have no food in the cupboards. I mean there was always ""something"" but it was usually like a single box of Mac or like saltine crackers with peanut butter, and that was split between like 6 of us. I would also compulsively exercise, waking up early before my parents get up to walk laps around the house, doing toe ups while I brushed my teeth, every moment was I was alone or behind closed doors was an opportunity to exercise. I don't remember when that started even, I was in gymnastics from age 3 so I was also doing long hours of that throughout the years.

At the end of elementary school, when I was 11, my depression got much much worse. That was the first time I starved myself with a purpose. I'm almost 28 now and have never had a moment where I felt ""recovered"".

2777,wanderlustcub,1577129449,eep9vn," Over the next couple of days, many of us will be faced with one of the toughest holidays of the year: Christmas. For a lot of people, even the word brings anxiety and thoughts and promises of restriction. Family will be seeing us and for some, the effects of restricting over the year may come out. There are a lot of stresses with the holidays and over the last week, we have seen some posts reflecting that high anxiety. 

What I want to say is something simple: Be kind to yourself. 

I know that seems weird to say, but a common theme I have seen on the sub (and within myself) is the constant self-blame, self-loathing, self-hatred tied to feelings of being unable to eat, unable to lose weight… being unable to eat… for whatever reason. Many posts start or end with “I hate myself.” I know I have said that many times to myself. 

It is ok to be kind to yourself. 

RuPaul famously says “If you can’t love yourself, how in the hell can you love somebody else?” I have always found that quote hard to stomach because my feelings of empathy and love extend outward, not inward… but there is truth in the statement. While I am not asking for the Christmas Miracle of everyone on the board suddenly gaining love for themselves… I simply ask that you are kind to yourself. 

What does that mean? 

It will be different for everyone. For me, it means that I don’t punish myself if something is not perfect. It means allowing yourself to have something and have that moment with your family. It is to not allow the ED to dictate your happiness. 

And if those are too big, just a step. A moment where you let yourself be loved by someone. To allow someone to wish you a Merry Christmas, and you accept it, because… you know they mean it. It means allowing yourself to know that someone is thinking of them. Even if it is from here. 

Be kind to yourself and give yourself grace. Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah, and Happy Holidays to you.

I’m not looking for sympathy or someone to give me the cliche “don’t give up” “it gets better” “you are enough”, etc. I’ve heard it all before and it doesn’t work. I could read those 10 million times and it wouldn’t make me feel any different. Life is shit. I actually don’t have that bad of a life. But I am incapable of being happy. No matter what I do, I’m depressed. I’ve lived with depression and anxiety for 11 years. Nothing works and I’ll never be happy. I’ve lived with this fucking monster in my head for 8 years. It’s never going to stop. I eat and I feel anxiety. I can’t just have good days. I eat and then I freak out and purge and then restrict the next day. It’s basically a cycle of restrict, eat (not binging) because I can’t take the hunger, panic and purge, restrict, try to eat normal because I’m sick of feeling this way, panic and purge, repeat. When I don’t eat I feel terrible, when I eat I feel worse. At least when I restrict and follow the rules I made for myself, the voice is a little quieter. When I eat I can’t focus on anything. All I can think about is the fact that I ate and the guilt. All I can’t think is I wish I were dead. At least when I don’t eat I can think about other things because I don’t worry about what I ate. Maybe I’ll die. I don’t care. I can’t live with this monster in my head forever. I can’t just eat like a normal person and live with this anxiety forever. They say I’ll eventually be happy but I won’t. They say eating will get easier but it won’t. I’ve tried and it just doesn’t happen for me. I’m destined to live with anorexia for the rest of my life. I’ll die from it. Because I can’t fucking fight this anymore. I went to a new doctor this week. I don’t own a scale because I’m broke but I measure myself often. I weighed myself at the kids I babysit house the day before my appointment. I was 95 pounds. On the verge of underweight. Then at my appointment, I was 101 pounds. A healthy weight supposedly. I was wearing my shoes and my coat but there’s no way that’s going to add 6 fucking pounds. I gained weight. Even though the day before I ate so much food and te day of my appointment I had eaten nothing. I gained weight because I’m a lazy fucking moron with no self control. I can’t handle it. I hate gaining weight. I don’t care if I’m underweight. I can’t do this. I’d rather be underweight. I’d rather be thin enough so I can feel my bones. And even see them. Every pound I gain makes me hate myself even more. I don’t hate fat people. I’m actually quite jealous of some of them. The one thing I do want is a nice ass. I have the flattest ass on earth and I hate it. But I still can’t eat because when I do, I gain weight in all the places I don’t want. I don’t hate fat people and I don’t think they are lazy, ugly, stupid, etc. But it’s different for me. I don’t know why but it is and there’s no use fighting it anymore. We had bloodwork done at my appointment and the only concern she had was my potassium and it was still normal. In my fucked up brain, that means I’m not trying hard enough. I don’t know why I want to be sick and I wish I didn’t. But I’m never going to get to a place where I want to be healthy. I don’t even think it’s possible for me to be healthy anyway. At my next therapy appointment, I’m just going to say I can’t do this anymore and I’m giving up so I’m not going to come anymore and waste her time. My therapist is wonderful and she’s helped a lot of people overcome eating disorders. But I never listen to her anyway. I’m not going to continue going and waste her time. She needs to focus on people who aren’t fucking failures and actual listen to her advice and have an actual chance of making progress. I’ve made myself a list of rules and strategies to avoid eating. I’m actually going to do it this time.  I’m going to follow the rules my ed has given me. I’m going to lose weight and maybe I’ll eventually like myself for once. This recovery thing doesn’t work so I give up. I can’t wait until I die so I don’t have to feel this anymore. I’d kill myself but I don’t have the nerve. Plus if I fail, my life will be even worse.

Alright so I’m not sure what I’m looking for here-validation? Outside thoughts? Maybe I just need to vent?

Basically I eat every two days or so (drinking coffee and water to sustain myself otherwise). And when I do eat, it’s one meal. Usually less than 700 calories if I can help it. But I’ve gotten to a point where try to vomit up basically every meal I manage? Today I ate 5 small crackers and instantly ran to the bathroom to purge. And then it was the same for dinner (half a chicken wrap) only a few hours later.  

I don’t exercise much, but I’ve gotten into the habit of walking to further bus stops after work, and getting off the bus early to walk home even though it’s freezing out. Some of my coworkers have noticed I don’t eat, so I actually started putting out snacks on my desk to give the illusion I am. In reality they just sit there. 

I’m just now reaching underweight territory, with my BMI at 18.5. I don’t have time to talk to doctors or therapists because I have a really invasive full-time job. And the people in my family would only yell at me if I brought up the struggle.

My father has a problem with desserts. Like he compulsively eats them in large quantities... one time he ate 3/4 of a 16” cookie cake, and today I guess he ate somewhere between 8 and 10 doughnuts. But he will never admit he ate them, we all get yelled at for it. When I woke up (slept in because night shift) and saw there were only bits of 2 left I decided it was time to shower. I’m now naked in my bathroom listening through the door because I just *can’t* go be part of it. It’s always the same. He’s yelling at my brothers for eating so many doughnuts... he has literally never once admitted that he was the one who ate the thing. So he’s going off about how many calories are in each doughnut (with specific numbers I choose not to include) and how much sugar there is, and how sugar will not only rot your teeth until you look like a homeless person and need dentures but also cause diabetes. Diabetes is it’s own rant that is mostly about neuropathy and amputation. But he never forgets to leave out how disgusting we’ll look with dimples above our elbows and calluses on our stomachs from our fat rolls rubbing together when we move. He’s now suggested that they skip dinner to make up for it because they have to be healthy for hockey. They’re 13 and 9! I don’t think he’ll actually make them skip dinner because he never has before with this, but he will make them feel guilty for eating it. And I’m so glad this isn’t directed at me because that would be so much worse, but this is so triggering to even hear through the door. The worst part is that I’m healthy enough that I would have probably had half of a doughnut and now I couldn’t even if there were any left because I just feel so sick to my stomach. 

As far as nature vs nurture goes, I’m going to have to vote nurture on this.

Since the beginning of this year, my cousin (13F) has been acting.. Off about her weight. I'm only 5/6 months older than her, but have a few mental disorders myself so I understand how hard it is to be fighting through it.

Backstory here:
Her mother (my aunt) isn't the most understanding person. I'd say she's on the line of being verbally abusive at times, and my father and her have had multiple arguments and the such, leading to our families having a bit of a grudge. We used to see each other a ton when we were younger, we still do but not as much. We go to the same school also.
She likely wouldn't care if I brought this up to her, so I don't even think anyone would take me seriously.

I thought maybe I could bring it up to my parents but they were pretty much making fun of the whole disorder, which I told them was unacceptable as its very real and affects people in horrific ways, but they didn't really get it.

Back to now:
She's skipping lunch, and sometimes breakfast. She's stopped eating fast food and is obsessed with eating healthily. She has had a pretty dramatic weight drop and she was skinny before hand. I'm getting increasingly more worried, she's obviously not doing okay but we don't usually have serious conversations. We have had a few, but in general she's hard to get through, and is quite closed off.

So, I have a few questions. I am more than willing to personally help her through this, I'll do anything, and I will be consistently there for her. I know she'll have slips and I know it's not going to be easy, but I am more than willing. I also won't try and push her to recover, I know it's about being ready in your own right or it'll be hard, but I also want to make sure she's as safe as possible. 
How can I best help?
Is there any food I can get that she would eat more willingly?
How do you guys like to be talked to about the subject, do you find you get triggered easily or anything like that?
How do I start that conversation?


And, yes, i am trying my best to get an adult involved, but I don't want her to get worse by involving the wrong one.

Trigger warning-- there's measurements, proportions, and numbers on the scale ahead. 

I just need to rant real quick. I've had a really rough time and I started a diet to lose weight and love myself-- but with recent events in my life it turned more into self hatred and just being comforted by the lowering numbers on the scale. I now feel the pain of hunger as a kind of reminder that nobody really cares, but they might if I feel it long enough. 

I have a larger frame. I am tall (5'11) I have big boobs (32DDD) and an average butt, wide hips that have that annoying violin dip. My thighs don't touch. I started on November 8 at 155 and reached my goal weight of 135 a week ago, and have been slowly going down since. 

And I still have a gut. 

I am absolutely devastated, and I need comfort before I start trying to lose more and label a new goal weight. I'm sorry if I'm not in the right place for this. I just am going through a lot and want some support for this in a place where I won't be judged. I really dont want to promote bonespo or anything but I literally reached the weight where they said I would be my healthiest and my stomach still pokes out. I can't believe this. It is one of my biggest insecurities and it won't go away unless I am underweight. 

At least if I'm underweight my boyfriend might get concerned, but I don't want all the medical problems of being underweight. I am so sad and I can't eat or sleep right now. I just work myself to death on nothing productive and drink black coffee to get through the day.  I have relapsed pretty bad. I used to be anorexic shortly after I was malnourished, because I didn't like the way the new weight rested on my body when I started eating. 

I used to be starved without my consent, and I now do it by choice. I used to be neglected by my mother without my consent, and now I choose to stay with him. 

I hate myself so much, and almost want to just waste away until I'm tiny and I die.

2857,ScreamAndScream,1577836167,eiaval,"Hey y'all, happy 2020. I'm still in shock and crying from getting dumped yesterday. 

My boyfriend is 24 and finishing his bachelors this summer and is going to apply for jobs in computer science afterwards. I met him because he works at my community college and it was love at first sight. We had a 6 hour first date and didn't stop talking for ages. I went away for the summer and he watched my pet while I was away, and when I came back I started sleeping over at his house more and more. 

He was very insistent that he didn't want me to move in and that mon-wed and the weekends together was great, but he needed more space. 

I was always honest with him about my recovery. I slipped a few times with not eating and told him how much he helped. I was always very grateful when he did the dishes and cooked for me, just as much as he was grateful when I would cook for him. 

I got a bit too housewifey, even though I work and go to school, and I think it scared him off. He's always been the sort of person where he defines success based on having a good career, I've always wanted a good home. 

When breaking up with me, he said he couldn't stand knowing that if he forgets to pack me lunch or bring me a snack that I just don't eat. It made him so sad to know that I only eat in front of others that it weighed on him. He said it felt like walking on eggshells and that he couldn't open up when he knew how bad I was some days. He said that the good times were good but he simply stopped loving me and didn't see us together in the future.

Sigh.

I miss him, I love him, and I'm doing insane person math to try and figure out how long it will take for him to miss me. If anyone else is insane, I'd really appreciate psychoanalyzing his fear of commitment getting in the way of his career with you. Fuck.

Now my mom is on my case and saying I need to make sure she’s eating this week while my parents are at work and my sister and I are on winter break from school.

2885,kindahungry-,1577619579,eh51iz,"I had to complain about mine and maybe complaining about yours might help you too. The rest of this post will be discussing mothers and poorly informed people when it comes to eds. Please don't read on if you think this might trigger you. Also it's very long and written on phone. My biggest trigger is my mum and I feel so bad about it. She's not very informed with eating disorders or how to handle them. For context I have suffered with body image and, looking back now, an unhealthy relationship with food since I can remember. I've always been on the higher side of a normal bmi if not considered overweight so when I started restricting heavily last year my mum congratulated me on losing so much in a month. At the end of one month of restricting I told my mum about the problem and that was my first mistake. I had built myself up for it so much, planned to do it in the car so I couldn't escape and hoped that having someone on my side would help. Her first reaction - ""did it hurt?"" Okay not so bad, coulda been more supportive but hey at least it isn't insensitive or anything like th- ""I thought you were smarter than that."" Ouch. Okay that one kinda hurt. Then next came what was present throught my whole ""recovery."" (It was a shit excuse for recovery just one appointment with some ass who did nothing than said I needed to gain weight again then saw the horror in my eyes, pointed it out and proceeded to not push for any actual help with it.) She had recently been through stomach band surgery and she asked ""is it because of me?"" This annoyed me so much because yes mum part of my ed is because of you but no not because of that. Because you feed me shit everyday when I was younger and I grew to hate myself. Then at like the age of 7 I kept that fact from you because you always leaned on me for emotional support since I can remeber and ever since the days you started to use me as your therapist I guess I haven't been able to open up to you. I know you where depressed, I know you were struggling too and I love helping you but jesus when your 8 year old daughter asks you ""is it normal to cry when you look in the mirror?"" You don't respond with ""depends on the circumstances."" And ignore it. You ask, y the fuck is my 8 yr old crying in the fucking mirror at herself hating herself? This is really long and there's more I could go over but to keep this actually readable I shall finish with some gems that have come in the past year of binging and emotional eating, till my relapse into reatriction now. 1 - you were wasting my food? That I slaved over for you? 2 - I thought I had taught you better and, my personal favorite, 3 - rants about how hard this is for her and guilt triping me into somehow supporting her ontop of planting her body insecurities on top of mine, telling all her friends without my permission. commenting on how much im eating and everything in between. Though you are sweet mum and I love you very much I wish I hadn't gone to you with this. Maybe I wouldn't have relapsed.

If I’m going to be judged and everything scrutinised so closely then why would I want to keep eating?

When I saw her yesterday, I was shocked, she has lost about 20 pounds, maybe more.
I hadn't seen her in two months so it might not seem like a dramatic weight loss, but I've noticed that she never eats in front of people anymore. She always says that she's not hungry or that she doesn't understand how people can eat. 
I'm afraid she might become anorexic and I really want to help her since I don't want her to hurt herself.

2919,okworst,1577416735,eg5j2g,"TW: weight loss mention

I've struggled on and off with AN for 8 years, and as I can't eat in front of most people it becomes apparent and brought up early in friendships. After knowing each other 2+ years, I moved in with a friend who suffered another eating disorder. We had sort of bonded over understanding each other, and she often came to me for support in bad patches of her eating disorder. My size fluctuated often over the 3+ years to follow of living with her, as recovery is. But I was generally okay the 5 years of knowing her.

I began to struggle with my food intake and lost a lot of weight. In the midst of this, she asks me to come on a road trip. 

After being there 2 days with 3 people I had only known months, I couldn't find myself comfortable to eat without it warranting a panic attack. When we got back to our hotel one night she asked me why I'm not eating, I said I can't, she tells me that's not true etc and that I have to go home because I'm triggering her by having lost weight and being unable to eat. We argued for hours, because much like she can't turn off her triggers, I can't turn on any cures.

That argument was the hill that our friendship died on, and I can't help but still feel hurt. I would have never expected someone who understands to tell me that it's having a disorder or being their friend the moment I relapse, after being there and listening to their explaining their symptoms and relapses to me for years. 

I guess I'm wondering if there are any boundaries I should be setting in place to avoid things like this? If so, how do you set those without hurting people? Has anyone experienced anything similar, is there anything constructive I could've done?

I am obese. I don’t “look the part”, I guess; but I am.  I’m starting a weight loss journey but I’ve quickly realized that it’s mostly fueled by my disordered thoughts.  I used to binge eat and attempted purging but always failed. I was severely depressed and suicidal. I’m an attempt survivor. I went to 3 inpatient psychiatric hospital stays as well as 8 weeks out patient. I managed to gain 20 or so pounds within 3 months and reached my heaviest weight of 191. I couldn’t handle it anymore and I couldn’t keep being a pig so my brain was like oh let’s hate ourselves and start starving. So I stopped eating lunch at school and avoided dinner at all costs. I even skipped breakfast but it wasn’t the move lol. Winter break started so I told my family I’m starting a weight loss journey and my dad immediately told my mom to stop forcing me to eat dinner. In fact my dad is inspired by my control. He thinks it’s awesome that I eat ~1000 cals a day max. He thinks it’s awesome that I walk at least 10,000 steps a day and burn at least 2560. I’m an inspiration. But I hate my self. I can’t eat food without seeing calories, cholesterol, trans fat, etc. I can’t eat a thousand calories without burning at least double. If my weight goes up on the scale I feel like the world is gonna end. I hate it. I wish I could express this to them but I’m doing well. I’m eating healthy. I’m working out. I’m losing weight. I currently have a BMI of 31.75. I’m killing my self if I stay fat. But I’m saving my life by losing it. It sucks. I’m just gonna be another success story.

2924,Kitty91998,1577384534,efyvad,"TW-calorie counts 

I try to tell everyone that I will gain weight if I eat more than 500 calories, and they refuse to believe me. It’s true. My metabolism is so damaged that if there are days that I eat 600-700, I will gain at least 3 pounds. Christmas was really difficult. I spent the day with my boyfriends family yesterday and had a wonderful time, but I made a careless mistake. I weighed myself in my boyfriends bathroom, and the scale said I gained like 7 pounds. (It was manual so it was hard to get an exact number) Prior to Christmas I was eating a lot more than usual for approx 4 days-500 calories a day. And I gained 7 pounds?! I got out of breakfast yesterday by using the old “I already ate” excuse, which my boyfriend wasn’t going to try to deny in front of everyone, but he knew. He was like “you already ate”? In a somewhat sarcastic manner, like he knew I was lying. I then only ate a few strawberries, grapes and half my plate of salad at Christmas dinner and his whole family was looking at me like I am a maniac. Everyone kept trying to offer me food. I then slipped up and drank a glass of wine and I have been beating myself up over it ever since. I avoid alcohol because of the high calorie count. If I do drink, I have like one shot or two and I am pretty much drunk since I don’t ever have anything in my stomach. 

After weighing myself I just felt so worthless all day yesterday. I felt disgusting, like I didn’t deserve to be in company of wonderful people who care about me. When we took the family picture in front of the tree I just wanted to run and hide. I kept telling my boyfriend to stand further in front of me and he wouldn’t. He is very tiny, and I’m not. I look bigger than him, especially by standing in front of him for the picture. All I could keep thinking is that I am going to fast until New Years, because by next Christmas I NEED to be so much thinner for that picture. But deep down I know that there won’t be another Christmas with him and his family if I keep this up...I have lost myself. I lost the one thing he loved most about me, which was my intelligence. I can’t even think straight now half of the time. I can’t write coherent sentences. We played this complex board game later on and I couldn’t keep up because I’m so malnourished...my brain is dying. I lied and said I was tired and faked falling asleep in the middle of the game because I was embarrassed. It made me feel like absolute shit, even more so because we were playing with his stepdad who is a professor, and I want to make a good impression on him. His stepdad kept saying that he needs to play this game with his two other kids because they are “smart enough” and would have a lot of fun with it. The voice inside my head kept taunting me the whole game for not being “smart enough” anymore. In the midst of the game I began having suicidal thoughts. (I am safe-no active plan. I just feel worthless) I’m losing myself. I’m losing my boyfriend. I think he’s having an emotional affair with a coworker-someone that can intellectually stimulate him in a way that I just can’t anymore. 

I know I don’t eat a lot but I feel like I eat way too much. I feel like I have eaten like a pig the past few days at an avg. of 500 calories a day. I hate this. I hate what I have become. 
I’m in the midst of a 107 hour fast because I feel guilty about 3 days of 500 calories and a glass of wine. It would be 7 days or longer if I wasn’t going to a friends house on the 30th who I know will force-feed me.

I'm just realizing in these days how much bad my ed could be. I didnt even realize I was losing control until my parents sat down with me and talked to me. My mother is a doctor and she noticed stuff, that I lost weight, that I vomited, that I'm reluctant to eat.

I'm confused. Half of me knows there's something off, the other half likes my body the way it is. I'm aware of the fact that vomiting is not ok, but I do feel better eating less. I accepted to get help because honestly I never have energy to do anything and I'm always in a bad mood. 

Also,in the past months I noticed so many weird things like insomnia, anxiety, nervousness over any small little thing, me wanting to be a hermit and not wanting to be with anyone, and over exercising, and I feel that these are not ok behaviour. 

Has anyone felt like that? As a med student I'm aware of the fact I fucked up my hormones and these are the reasons for feeling like this, apart from fasting. I do want to feel ok but I'm so scared to be overweight. I was overweight years ago, and I love looking skinny. But I want to be also healthy.

I am not diagnosed with anorexia, and I never go around saying that I have it. I do however relate to almost everything in this reddit, and I just put anorexia in the title because I can’t put this whole disclaimer in the title. I hope you understand.

Anyhow, I have been feeling inspired to take more control of my life, alongside the food. I plan to continue extensive starvation, and strive to be able to reject food. It has come to my attention though, that anorexia is closely related to depression, anxiety and stuff like that. 

I have no issue with that, but I am just wondering if I am able to control both my life AND the calorie-terrified voice in my head. I’m happy living this way so far.

While I want to create a living for myself, and want to begin getting back into achieving high grades, I’m also motivated to starve and stay underweight.

Can an actual anorexic person have motivation for anything other than food, like I do?

Does this mean I shouldn’t consider myself to have a disordered view of food and carry on since I’m content like this?

3037,Bastianc1,1579166954,eph36i,"I'm going to sum up a woman's life and a 4 year relationship in a few paragraphs so bear with me here. There's a lot to tell so this will be long. 

We met at a party. Both heavy drug users, our relationship started with a pact to help each other quit. There were relapses along the way but as of this year we are 2 years sober.

She had a tough childhood. An absent father and a Mother with severe Schizophrenia resulted in her being sent to one foster care after another from very young until she was 18. As a Ward of the State, she was given money from the Government, free therapy, and some  other generous yet ultimately useless perks until she was 21 - then her benefits stopped and she was, once again, alone. Unable to afford all of the services herself, she was forced to stop seeing her therapist-the one person who was actually helping her-and move into a disgusting apartment just to afford the cost of living while working a minimum wage job***

She was severely bullied her whole life and has hundred of cuts all over her body, some of which the scars are so deep I'm surprised she didn't cut her leg or arm clean off. She has been clinically diagnosed with BPD. Her symptoms include but are not limited to severe depression, anxiety, self harm and dissociating . All of this plus at least one suicide attempt brought on or worsened by the powerful stimulants she was using caused her to be hospitalized on and off for 3 years, with her longest in-patient stay being 4 months. This all happened before she was 18***

Somewhere during that time she was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa. I had no idea as her symptoms were not present for the first year of our relationship. We went out for dinner weekly, drank lots of beer, cooked greasy fat filled food. Then, all of the sudden, shes restricting to 400 to 600 calories a day and had lost 67lbs (from 176 to 109) in 6 months by changing nothing but her calorie intake and using laxatives. 


She's finished DBT and has done in patient treatment at an eating disorder clinic but was discharged in week 19 of 20. This was a massive trigger for her. She relapsed immediately. She is now on the waiting list to get back in and we are requesting residency right away to help interrupt her symptoms but, because she was a healthy weight at her initial assessment she was diagnosed with Bulimia sub type binge purge. This only made matters worse as she felt she was no longer skinny enough for a diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa.

Before I continue I want to say that I do not pity her. She's the most courageous person I've ever met. If I had been through half the stuff she has I guarantee I wouldn't have made it past 18.

Fast forward to today. She eats no more than 800 calories every day, sometimes as low as 400. She went from 109 to 145 in treatment and is now back down to 114 as of today. She will only eat 4 or 5 different foods (5 cal jello, 15 cal yogurt etc), binge purging once or twice a day and using diuretics and laxatives weekly (daily??)

I feel useless. I've been to a few seminars and seen a free counselor who specializes in peer support for people with ED and she told me  ""all you can do is be there for her and show her you care, and support her while she fights her battle. Make sure she never forgets you're in her corner""

Very cute. I did that for months and now I am watching her slowly whither away. There must be something else I can do. How can I help her manage her symptoms?? Can I help ease her off of the laxatives? (She takes 10 at a time)


Looking for any and all advice. Feels good to type it out and get it off my chest.

she tumbles from my bed,
all legs and eyes,
silent footsteps on
tiled graves, weights sewn into the bottoms of her feet

she whispers in the steam around the mirror, 
finds me in my sleep and pries my lips apart,
fills me with these things that I can’t remember how to get rid of,
no matter how empty I am 

her siren songs wake me from shadows.
she sleeps in the divots across my ribs,
she makes her home in the valley between my hips

is it her iced hands or mine that crawl up and down the ladder of my spine? caresses the yielding curve of my tailbone? 

I can no longer tell her grasp from my own

so who is it keeping me hostage?

this small whisper in the steam around the mirror,
her mantras a safety net branded across my skin, 
comfort screwed and clamped into my bones,

not my will,

I’ve seriously tried probably 10 times over the last 15 or so years now and have been hospitalized a few times and went to 2  treatment places and it seemed to help but now I’m just a woman in her late 20s who doesn’t know if her period will ever be regular that thinks she looks the same at 80 pounds as she does at 130 pounds. Seeing old pictures from when I was 95 pounds makes me feel sick it was in August and I’ve been so depressed and lazy eating late sleeping late or barely sleeping and drinking too much. 

This isn’t what recovery looks like, I feel like I’m just filling the void with food and alcohol because I have no reason to give a shit about how I look. After all, anorexia was never 100% about that anyway. I feel like I’ve got the motivation to stop giving a shit about how fat I feel but for some reason cannot accept that I’m at a healthy weight but need to take my actual REAL health (not just some BS weight bracket) into account in order to feel better. 

I literally have no support and living alone in this garbage infested apartment makes me want to cry and I can’t sleep I haven’t eaten since I looked at those pictures because I was so thin and didn’t even realize it. It’s too late to eat now and I wish I could call out of work but I can’t. I wish I could find a therapist but my schedule and insurance and lack of money makes this impossible.

about a week ago, i found out i’m pregnant. honestly, i’m overjoyed. my menstrual cycle has been out of whack for a long time due to my ED and taking plan b a couple times. my coworker with endometriosis was concerned because i would tell her about it and she thought i had endo as well and with that comes infertility. 

all i’ve ever wanted to be was a mother. and i was going to wait until i was about 25, but after one of my other mental disorders got worse, i got reckless. and now i’m pregnant with a child to a guy that’s not even my boyfriend anymore, has a kid to be born any day now, no car or license...needless to say, it was a bad choice. but regardless, i intend on keeping it and raising it as best as i can. 

i’m really early in, only three and a half weeks, and i already eat and sleep a lot more, as well as breast growth (as i expected). but now that i see i’m gaining, all i want to do is starve, throw up and exercise. i really don’t want to lose the child because it’ll destroy me. but the weight gain is going to drive me insane. 

my question is if there’s any mothers on this sub that have gone through something similar and how to deal with it. i’ve bought some healthy foods to eat but i’m attracted to ramen noodles and dill pickle chips for who knows what reason. any advice will help greatly :)",i’m pregnant and i don’t think i can deal with the weight gain.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/eovkpv/im_pregnant_and_i_dont_think_i_can_deal_with_the/,1579075280.0,2020-01-14 20:01:20

3064,Pickypalace,1579031282,eoqbud,"hi guys,

I do not have anorexia, but I have been having some weird problems with eating for the past few months. A LOT happened to me that had made me fall into a very low depression and I lost almost 10 kg due to loss of appetite. However, I have a compulsive skin picking disorder, and I find that if I can’t “perfect” my skin i have to perfect something else to feel good about when I just feel ashamed in my own skin. I’m not sure if this is what I’m also doing on top of a rocky appetite, as in I’ll feel accomplished if I had less than I should daily or ill filter my meals with rituals like must contain less meats, more fish, more veg, only grain carbs, less milk, no sugar, etc. I don’t see myself as fat at all, but I’ve noticed I’ll feel way more guilty than I usually should if I don’t eat less or constricted. It would bother me if i did gain weight. I’ve never in my life been concerned with weight before.

I’m not sure if this sounds like a problem especially considering I already struggle with a similar self destructive / perfecting disorder, or how anorexia starts (I assume it’s first with perceiving yourself to be overweight and then you start eating less?).

Anyways, high school sweet heart and ended up at diff colleges and lost touch. Looked her up and she’s married now with kids.

I’m just coming to terms with this now, because I recently broke up with my gf that didn’t have ED.. because I just couldn’t find her as attractive or just that relatable.. didn’t tell her all this. I just know I can never date anyone that doesn’t have ED. 

What somewhat scares me is that every time I have dated someone with ED.. I’ve basically taken on their eating habits. Eventually when I don’t seen them for a few days I’ll go back to eating normally. I’ve never gone into a dangerous body weight.

I have gone through several notebooks and a calendar just for planning exactly what I eat and how many calories and how much weight I expect to lose. If anyone looked at them I would die from shame.

In no way do I want to diminish that or downplay what she’s going through. 

I remember when my eating disorder started at 16. I forced myself into it. I remember I thought it was a way to see how far I can push my limits. It was like a contest with myself. I remember how good it felt to lose weight &amp; I remember how fucking awful it felt to be so damn hungry. 

I try to remember how I felt when dealing with her... I don’t want her to become as sick as me. I try to warn her but she thinks it’s some fucking joke. 

I fear that when I eat around her she thinks I’m “healthy”

I want to recover, although it’s not going well, but I feel as though my desire to recover makes her think I’m not sick. I fear that when I’m bloated she thinks I’m a fake. I fear that even though I’m very underweight she doesn’t see that. 

Why am I so fucking concerned about what she thinks? Why is my ex posting things dogging super skinny girls knowing that I’m literally deteriorating from this? Why do I feel like a giant fucking joke who can’t even eat five bites of food without hating myself? 

&amp; why the fuck is my best friend thinking anorexia is some type of fucking fun. I try to tell her “dude, this is NOT what u want” but she doesn’t listen. She continues to talk about how she wants to fast. 

I don’t even fucking fast, I just don’t fucking eat at all... god, I wish I could just fucking fast &amp; then resume eating. 

Sorry this is all over the place &amp; im a train wreck.

In my ballet class there is a girl (about 24 years) who is very very thin. When she does jumps she almost looks like a stick figure to me. Most of the times she comes to practise she is already in her outfit but in december we had a performance and she changed in front of me. I was able to count her ribs and her vertebra (sorry, english is not my first language). I know most ballerinas are quite thin but she does not look healthy. Without makeup she looks very sick. 
We get along very well in class but besides that we don't have a lot to do with each other.
She lives alone and her parents live in another country but her sister lives here too and goes to the same ballet school as we do.

Should I express my concern or ask the sister if her sibling is doing okay? Or would you recommend to stay out of it?

3156,im_fucking_ded,1579672918,es7tgi,"So, for almost a year I’ve been super good at recovering. I gained quite a bit of weight and it actually felt pretty good. 

 Lately, I’ve been kind of getting lost in mind spirals about weight loss and I keep remembering how good it felt to lose weight. I’ve downloaded and deleted the apps I used when my eating disorder was at it worst probably 3 times this month. 

 Earlier tonight, I bought some gum and chewed it. I usually only ever chew gum if I’m fasting. I don’t even know what made me buy it. I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately though. I go to a gas station to get a drink almost every single day and I always see the gum at the check out and I think about buying some but then I never do.  

 I just recently (like, 10 minutes ago) re-downloaded my fasting app, calorie counter app, and step counter app and started a fast. I don’t really want to get trapped in this cycle again, especially because no one thinks my eating disorder is a problem. It’s also hard for me to talk about because anorexia is a “girl thing” so it’s kind of embarrassing to be a dude with it. 

 I just really don’t want to get stuck in this cycle again, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to stop it.

3157,bubblyqueer,1579661354,es5nve,"I know I shouldn’t but I do. 

Every week, my dietitian alas about racing heart and chest pain. She reminds me of how serious anorexia is and how it can hurt my heart. Last week, I purged for well over an hour. My heart was racing and I was in the shower and had to turn the water to cold. I’m *always* cold so that is saying something. Nearly 50 degrees last couple days. Today I was wearing a sweater and still freezing. Not even underweight atm (it fluctuates between underweight and low end of healthy which of course makes me feel like shit). Anyway, I felt dizzy and thought I might pass out. My dietitian was pretty concerned and said that I could have died at that moment. 

So today when I woke up with my back in pain and then chest pain that came on suddenly and stayed throughout the day, I was worried but scared to go to urgent care because I was afraid it was my heart and they would admit me (I can’t afford to be admitted and take leave. Refer to my post history for a full explanation of this). I’m in a recovery group chat and they convinced me to go. My normal hospital has this ridiculous new system where you can save your spot online for urgent care. So I check and their urgent care has nothing today. So I go to urgent care through another hospital. They do all the normal stuff. My blood pressure is fine. My lungs sound fine and my heart sounds fine. They do an EKG and she said it looks textbook normal. She said it could be anxiety or the beginning of a cold. 

I know I shouldn’t but I feel stupid. I did tell them I have an eating disorder when I got there but they still didn’t seem concerned. I feel like I wasted my time. It makes me feel like I’m completely fine and this isn’t really an issue. Even though I’m always cold, my fingers are blue, and I often feel like I’m going to fall. I do lose my footing a lot just standing. I know I’m sick but somehow this makes me feel like I’m completely fine. I also had my blood and urine checked about a month ago and everything was normal. I feel very much like this is a reason to keep going and “proves” that I shouldn’t eat and don’t deserve food. 

I almost laughed when the doctor asked if I have anything I do to destress. Almost said something to the extent of “I told you guys I have an eating disorder when I came in. You can probably figure out that my coping skills are not healthy” 

I was telling people at work I might not make it in tomorrow. I work at a school as a tutor so I have to do a lot of communication with teachers and I wanted them to be aware if I wasn’t there. Now I feel like everyone is going to be hyper aware of me and be worried about everything I do. People already express concern when they see me not eating and offer me food all the time. I’m afraid people are going to put 2 and 2 together. I don’t want *anyone* to know I have an eating disorder. No one at the school knows and I want to keep it that way. I’d rather just say I have medical issues.

3159,unbridledirony,1579656609,es4oda,"Hi, this is my first post here bc I just stumbled upon this thread.  I wasn’t sure if this needs a TW but I figured better safe than sorry.
I’ve always disliked my body and felt like I weighed too much since puberty. I was never more than like ten pounds overweight, but I hated my weight anyway. It wasn’t super important to me, though. I was young enough that my metabolism let me eat pretty much whatever I wanted in high school because I also worked out a lot. 
Last summer when I graduated high school a lot of traumatic things happened right after the other and made me very depressed. I also had my wisdom teeth taken out and for some reason, I had an awful recovery. I was in such pain that I couldn’t eat, and I couldn’t take my pain meds on an empty stomach, so the pain intensified until I threw up whatever I ate. I was so nauseous and depressed all the time and barely ate for a few weeks, which also worsened my recovery because I was physically weak. I lost a lot of weight to the point that it was unhealthy. I was at the low end of normal for my height/build, but I looked very sick and my family was super concerned and kept commenting on how thin I looked.
And I loved it.
I kept most of the weight off after I recovered from my surgery until I got to college. I ate a lot of comfort food at college and junk food because it was quick and easy, and I gained the weight back. I became anxious about eating around others. About a month ago I was back to the recommended weight but that’s too much. 
For the past few weeks I’ve been constantly thinking about this. I’ve been restricting calories to less than half of my recommended intake. All I eat is a bowl of cereal in the morning and a protein bar later in the day to keep me full, and the rest of the day I just drink water and chew gum to keep from eating food. I’m uncomfortable eating in front of others. I’m always planning what I’m going to eat the next day and how I can further cut calories by not drinking milk, switching to low-sugar/low-fat stuff, skipping breakfast, etc. I’m obsessed with my calorie intake. I have an unhealthy sense of pride in keeping up this diet and I know if I had a bag of chips for example I’d feel disgusted with myself. I fixate on the mirror and lose hours staring at every curve/fat area of my body until I dissociate. I exercise late into the night. Not an hour goes by that this stuff doesn’t cross my mind. I wish I could get my wisdom teeth out again and lose a ton of weight.
I have no idea how much I weigh right now because I couldn’t afford a scale and I can’t go to the health center and ask to check my weight without looking weird and suspicious. My pants are slightly loose so I’ve lost a bit but I can’t tell how much. My self-image is probably too distorted to tell what I actually look like anyway.
I’ve been dealing with a relapse of mental illness as well. I have depression, anxiety, and OCD, which usually get worse in winter no matter what. I know I’m at high risk for developing an eating disorder because of my mental illness, my history of c*tting, and my mom had an eating disorder as a teen (I think she had bulimia but she may have just had anorexia).
What’s going on? Am I anorexic? I’m not skinny or underweight. I don’t know if I’m just exaggerating my issues or if I’m actually sick. I don’t know if I should tell my friend or someone.

I'm 5'11 and 119 pounds.
My previous doctor never mentioned anything about any kind of eating disorder. He just told me to eat more and didn't make a big deal out of my weight loss. I went to this doctor because I was worried about hair loss and feeling tired and dizzy all the time. I'm aware my weight may have something to do with that but I thought it might be something else as well because I'm not that underweight and it started getting worse recently.

I admit I have issues with my body image, however I never intentionally starved myself to become underweight and I don't even want to be skinny, it just happened.

About a year ago I was obese, I started a diet and got very obsessed with it and ended up underweight. I have been underweight for several months now and I would like to gain muscle but it's hard to eat more.

I am very careful and controlled with what I eat and I calorie count, however I do NOT starve myself. I eat a healthy vegan diet, just enough to maintain my weight. I have no desire to become thinner, but I am very afraid of gaining the weight back, which is why I became underweight and why I haven't made any genuine effort to start gaining again. 

The one thing that the doctor really latched on to was the fact that i take appetite suppressants, I only take them because I took them throughout my weight loss, and I know binging often follows restriction and I don't want to binge and gain all the weight back.

I’m so fed up with the “you’re too skinny”, “you’re all bones”, “you’re going through something most teenage girls go through”. Like shut the fuck up.

Not eating makes me happy. And it has nothing to do with outer influence. I brought this on myself and only I can fix it!!! So if I don’t want to fix it, which I don’t, let me be!!

A few years go by and I grew a few inches, so I don’t look that fat by I am still unsatisfied, I am still chubby, I envy so much my skinny friends. So I want to loose weight, my first goal is 53 kilos, I am currently at 56, I been on a diet for almost 12 weeks. 
Even tough my BMI is at the normal range I still feel obese sometimes, and I am been really obsessive with the food I eat. I count every calorie, I calculate how much calories I burn with every exercise I do, basically I have a chart of my total calories on my body and I add the calories I eat and then I rest the calories I burn, I like to have everything under control. 
Lately the thought of throwing up Carme through my mind, I know is a really bad thing, but I feel that I could help me to stop being so anxious about the calories I eat, but I still don’t because I know that it can affect my birth control, so yeah.

3196,alisonsw,1579405856,eqrdvi,"This isn't just about anorexia, but I don't know if i wanna post this in r/depression.

Right now, it's 9:24 pm. I'm sitting in bed surrounded by low calorie ice cream, Diet Coke, and my laptop.

My best friend just told me that she tried to kill herself a few days ago, but I've been ignoring her because I'm too caught up in my own shit to even think that other people have problems too. She left me on read a couple of times, so I decided that she didn't care about me and I shouldn't spend a second even thinking of her. She got her phone taken away after the incident, so that's why she hasn't texted me back.

I'm wearing a big sweatshirt and sweatpants even though my room is 77° because I can't stand the sight of my own body. I can't admit to my own therapist that my eating habits are disordered. I advertise my obviously unhealthy and obsessive eating habits to my friends and family as caring for my body, but in what world is eating 600 calories a day or counting each cheerio that I eat good for my body?

I'm so selfish. In general. How could I not check in on my best friend who I should have known was struggling? All I've talked or thought about for the past 2 weeks has been my sister, who as it turns out is fine, she says that she's very happy. But even after that, I don't trust what she says and I continue to worry for her when I'm neglecting other areas of my life that need help. 
 
These past few days I've been trying to live without MyFitnessPal and every other calorie counter, but after 2 days I hate myself and I can see the weight that I've put on. I deleted Tumblr because it's triggering. Why do I still feel like this?

My therapist told me today that I have nothing to worry about. ""Today, you're wearing the most form fitting thing I've ever seen you wear and I can't understand what you're so upset over. To me, you look perfectly healthy and quite slender."" That's what upsets me. Everyone who I complain to about my body says that I'm worrying over nothing. I'm healthy. It doesn't matter what the scale says, I look healthy. It just feels like instead of trying to help me, she just tells me that I'm thin. OK. Thank you. So what do I do about this monster that I see in the mirror? 

I don't know what to do about any of this. This past week I've been ignoring my best friend, but why? That's so toxic and stupid of me. What healthy person would do that? I'm just so so tired and I feel out of control. Keeping track of what I eat has always been a major coping mechanism for me. I feel like I'm really not ready to give it up. It has been two days. Two days. I can't go without tracking my calories for two days. I'm gonna close this pretty soon but how do I offer my friend my support when I can't talk to her? I don't know what to say to her either. I told her that I love her and that I'm sorry that she feels like this. What else?

3200,Kitty91998,1579390716,eqoeop,"I started this journey in the obese BMI range. I am now a healthy weight for my height, so those who don’t know that I’m actually quite unwell keep congratulating me (as if they can’t tell with the huge dark circles under my eyes that look like I got sucker punched). I have lost 70 pounds since the middle of October. All I hear from everyone is “you look so good”! And it only feeds my eating disorder more. All I can think about is the fact that if I would have started this journey in the healthy BMI range, I would actually look sick right now. I would look the way I want to look. My boyfriend said “if you lose any more weight I won’t have anything left to hold”. I still want to lose at least 40 more pounds. I don’t know where this ends. I don’t believe I’ve lost 70 pounds. The number seems shocking, but most days I still see the same person in the mirror that I saw when I was 70 pounds more. This is the lowest weight that I have been in years, since I was suffering with Ana when I was 12 and was underweight. 

I have now entered uncharted territory because this whole time my excuse was “I need to lose weight for my health”. But now I don’t have a feasible excuse. I look “normal” and “healthy”, which I just don’t see. The guy that my roommate is seeing was just talking about his “thick thighs” referring to how it’s difficult to find jeans and looked at me and said “trust me, it’s a struggle” (roommate has *objectively* bigger legs) as if I didn’t get it. This was very hard for me to comprehend. I was obese for the past year or two. I’ve always been the “thick” one. And I still feel like I am. I still feel like I look overweight. 

 I’m at the point where I can (seriously this tome) try to attempt recovery knowing that I am at a “normal” weight, or I can just get sicker, knowing that I am the closest I have been to my goal in years. I don’t think I can stop. I am too afraid of going back, and I’m so close now. This is acting more as a motivator to become sicker than to get better, and I know it shouldn’t.

For my twenty-fifth birthday, I gave myself a forty eight hour fast. A few days later I did a thirty hour fast. I have eaten for the last fourteen hours because I was exercising and felt like I was going to vomit and pass out and my chest hurt and I was struggling with breathing. Now I'm doing another forty eight hour fast. After I broke my thirty hour fast with a ""safe"" meal, I started panicking about all of the calories, and the fat I'd gain, and then thinking about dying. 

I need to save money but today I am going to get a full body composition scan to find out my weight on highly accurate scales, my body fat %, my muscle mass, my ratios, abdo fat, visceral adipose tissue score, bone density, etc. so that I can obsess and scrutinise and hate myself. 

My weight is the lowest it's been in five years and this year I fully intend to reach my ugw, the one I've wanted to reach for a decade. I thought that would be enough except after looking at myself in the mirror today I had the thought, ""losing another Xkg probably won't be enough to get rid of this fat"" and so I'm going to have to go lower now.

I'm about to drop one of them because I can't process enough information or make it through my assignments when I'm fasting and so obsessed with numbers and food.

Have never believed in myself, everyone else does tho n it’s sad how I just keep starving myself, use laxatives every now n then to empty my bowel to stay thin cause I’ve fucked up my digestion so food gets all stuck in there. Can’t go to school cause bad shit happened there as well back in the days. Not even sure what I’d pursue as a career, most likely couldn’t focus to studying due to my past.

I eat for awhile maybe even a week, then stsrt hating my body, take laxatives, starve, cigsrettes, caffeine which I try to limit as it fucks up my sleep n makes my anxiety worse. Tho I do like to numb myself by not eating, helps w anxiety.

I look back some old shirtless pics of me n not even sure am I fat or fine them. Clearly I was fine in most of them, like after I grew up n started eating healthier. Until years go by n u can see how I’m losing muscle n my stomach begins to collect all the food n water weight not able to let it.

After I finished talking, she told me... That it was nice to hear how determined I was to change for the better. But she also felt like I was being too hard on myself. Then one thing led to another, and she finally called me out. She told me: ""I've noticed you haven't been eating. You've been talking about your plans to take care of yourself but... We've been working over time everyday the past few weeks and I've only ever seen you eat once in a day.""

That kinda caught me off guard. Because looking back, she was right. I haven't been eating. 

I've been choosing not to.

And just like that, I remembered all the times I've been unconsciously telling myself ""I wonder if I can get through the day without eating"" and ""I've forgotten how good it felt to feel hungry.""

And I can't ??? I can't even pinpoint where it all started. I just started losing my appetite. I just started opting to smoke instead of eating. I just started limiting my food intake, and feeling disgusted when I ate too much. I've been buying packs of gum instead of crackers to get me through the day.

When all this was happening, I never thought ""Oh I think I might be relapsing""

So. Idk. I don't really know where I'm going with this. I guess I was just really surprised. 

And now, I also feel bad because I sound like a hypocrite. Because tbh, with the way things are going... I still don't want to eat. How can I expect myself to get better if I refuse to let go this part of my life?

Also... I've been noticing my body getting smaller. My collarbones are starting to show again. My thighs are getting thinner... And I hate that that this is the only thing that's exciting me at the moment.

I hope that statement didn’t break the rules, I am just trying to express what condition I’m in so I can provide a better understanding of my situation. I also know that no one here are medical professionals-I just want to know *your* experience. I’ve started to experience more symptoms and I’m getting worried. Two weeks ago I made a drastic transition-I fell into acceptance. I didn’t think I was sick. I took a selfie without makeup on today and I said to myself, “god, I look like I’m fucking dying”. And it hit me today. I’m unwell. Really unwell. I’ve been grappling with my mortality all day. I don’t think I want to die-but I don’t know where this ends. Since I’ve already lost so much weight, it’s possible something really bad can happen once I hit underweight. My therapist keeps telling me if I lose the weight I want to still lose that I’m going to die. She also told me that there was a woman who lost around the same amount of weight as me in a similar time frame and she died from heart failure, even though she was still overweight when she died. 
I also smoke copious amounts of nicotine and I’m afraid it’s increasing my risk of heart complications. 
I’m trying to decide if I should just go in for a checkup at urgent care-I went two months ago because I was really sick (as I found out, a result of the anorexia) and my levels were already really abnormal at that time.

I have a very good relationship with my boss and a number of colleagues. 

Because I work at a university, we get a few months break. The last time I saw everyone, my BMI was 17.6. It is now 16.0, and there is one more month until I see them again so it’s going to be at least 15.5. I don’t think I look much different, but other people in my life disagree with this. 

Today my psychologist asked me what’s going to happen when these health professionals I work with inevitably ask me “what’s going on?”, “are you okay?”, when they notice my weight loss, see me and that I look unwell (apparently). She expects my boss to pull me aside if I keep losing weight during semester. Not to mention — what if my performance declines because I can’t think? 

It got me thinking, what am I going to do? Obviously lie and say I’m fine but what if I get to a BMI where it is obvious that I have an eating disorder?

My friend has an eating disorder. She has always told me about how she was insecure about her weight, so when she started bringing less and less food to school, I knew that something was wrong. 

She is a very busy person, she is a semi-professional sports person, so she doesn't have a lot of free time. When I bring up seeking treatment, she freaks out and starts telling me that her sport is way more important than her health, and that her and her parents are trying to recover without professional help. I dont know if this is the truth.

I dont want to trigger her, or force her to recover, but it has gotten really bad, and im afraid that something really bad might happen if she doesn't get professional help.

Fair enough. But I have both and I know it! I'm terrified of eating new foods or foods of a certain texture or foods that will trigger my intolerances but I am also terrified of not losing weight! 
So naturally it fluctuates; cornflakes are a comfort food for me but I feel like it's gonna add to the fat on me, and carrots are a food I know won't make me feel fatter but they make me very anxious because for some reason I don't trust carrots. I dunno why, just my autistic ass decided on what food is devilspawn and what food isn't and I just abide. 
Being that they put me in outpatient eating disorser treatment, my family is constantly monitoring my eating and it means I have to work towards starvation in secret. I also hate to contribute to global food waste so I eat what I'm given, but nothing else. When I am feeling really harrowed by how much I've eaten and how much I miss the emptiness, I over-exercise. I get to school and I try to talk to my mates about having been diagnosed with an ed but I feel like a fool and a self-obsessed hypercondriac because I'm at expected weight.
I have a couple of friends who are really skinny but it's just because of their metabolism. I(or the anorexia) envies being so small. I also have really low self-esteem and I can't bear to have like a medium size body. Like I don't deserve it somehow so I have to shrink myself away. I try to act completely normal like everyone else around my skinny friends but I'm actually overboiling with emotions most of the time. My mind is preoccupied with how much I want to be smaller so I kinda mention the topic of their weight too much, just without realising.

The last ED wave was this summer; I was heavily restricting. After not having eaten anything for a week I was eventually hospitalized for what they chose to call a ""suicide attempt"" because men aren't supposed to be anorexic. They didn't help me at all and I was paired with a doctor who broke doctor-patient confidentiality. It was overall not a salubrious experience.

I decided to take matters into my own hands as I understood that I wouldn't get any help from my healthcare providers. I recovered, but recently I've fallen back, and now I'm back at square one. I'm restricting to the extreme and I want to become healthy again- I just don't know how. I've told my psychologist, and she will be informing my psychiatrist and counselor, but I'm afraid it won't help; it never has, so far.

I feel so alone in this, especially since I'm a guy. I try to seek out similar stories and such online since that's supposed to help with the loneliness, but I dont really feel ""seen"".

3304,aliasofanalias,1579996515,etyuw2,"Last night this guy Ive been seeing for about 2 and a half weeks and I had sex for the second time—we had been drinking and he wasn’t wearing a condom. The whole thing was really stupid. Ok both our parts. He didn’t know I wasn’t on birth control that is totally on me. I should have said something. I guess I’m just used to being in a relationship and in relationships they always ask, they always know I’m not because I don’t feel good on it and I hate it and they use a condom. He never asked and I sort of assumed he’d pull out because (and I haven’t had sex with too many guys but the ones I’ve had sexual with who ARENT boyfriends always immediately put on a condom and ask if I’m bc and sometime even *with* a condom pull out) and my past boyfriends if they don’t use a condom ALWAYS pull out. And it’s been fine. 

But last night this guy just kind of abruptly stopped. I thought he was tired and just couldn’t go on. He didn’t make any of the usual noises, or motions of anything that he was about to orgasm. When he abruptly stopped I said “are you ok? I can try another way to make you get there” and he said “I just did” I was in total TOTAL shock because he absolutely didn’t seem like he did, I had no idea and then realized wow WTF you just did that with no condom, no warning, no pulling out , nothing. And he seemed totally unbothered by it. So I got really upset and worried and silent for about 5 mins then said “well I’m worried because I’m not on birth control and you weren’t wearing a condom” he didn’t seem phased in the slightest, was totally relaxed and said “that’s ok, you can get the plan b pill tomorrow. Or I’ll get it for you” 


Yeah, well, he doesn’t understand that i don’t take birth control so I haven’t had extra or different hormones in me in FOREVER. Especially a high amount. The one and only time I took the plan B pill it was like 12 years ago because my boyfriends condom broke. It made me break out with pimples really badly, that’s one thing. It also made me super nauseous, super crampy and made me bleed a lot for about a week. What I don’t remember is if it made me gain any kind of weight anywhere because I wasn’t anorexic 12 years ago and didn’t think about stuff like that. 

But now I obsess over it obviously. So has anyone who is actively anorexic and deeply concerned about their weight taken the Plan B? And how did you react? I think knowing or hearing from people with the same concerns might lessen my anxiety. Because I’m scared it will make me super hungry, make my boobs bigger, cause a ton of water retention, possibly slow down my metabolism, make me break out with acne and make my periods irregular when right now they’re SUPER regular and I hate to have to mess with that.",Has anyone who is active in their anorexia had to take the Plan B pill?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/etyuw2/has_anyone_who_is_active_in_their_anorexia_had_to/,1580018115.0,2020-01-25 17:55:15
3305,PlusheenCake,1579987862,etwypd," 

It started when I was 14. I had always been conscious of the way I looked but this, this was different. I started small, just eating a little bit less and working out more. I knew all about eating disorders. we had studied them in school. I never thought I would be that girl, the girl with the eating disorder. it all seemed so far away, so unrealistic.


The small steps I took grew bigger. I started restricting, hiding food, and spent all my time fixated, concentrated, on my weight, my next meal, how much exercise I needed to do. I grew thinner, and I developed bruises on my back from all the sit ups I was doing in a desperate, vain attempt to try and lose the weight that I hated so much. It got to the point where I would stand in front of the mirror, naked, and look at all my flaws. From my eyes, there was nothing good about myself. I only felt good, only felt ok about myself, when I was hungry.


Eating brought shame and guilt, and visits to the bathroom where I could cry from my self-loathing, and consider all my options. I became obsessive over the amount of food I ate, and the number of calories I burnt.


The voices inside my head whispered to me incessantly, telling me that it wasn't enough, no matter what I did.


I became concentrated on losing more and more weight, and it was never enough. I was underweight, faint and dizzy, fatigued, but I could not see these symptoms.


When I finally noticed that something was wrong, I was running, and suddenly, I could barely stand. I fell to the floor and did not move for maybe ten minutes, gathering my strength. I walked the rest of the way home and since then, have begun to get help for my condition, more commonly known as anorexia. Relapses are a still a regular occurrence for me.


But, this is my fight, and I won't give up. I know that there are many others out there, who fight their own demons on a regular basis, and it is no different for me. Know that you are f***ing strong for getting this far, and please don't give up hope.

I was officially diagnosed with anorexia nerviosa over the summer and I have been struggling with recovery since then. I’m a 5’11 male and hit 150 lbs. this summer before my parents told me how  frail I looked. Growing up I was always on the heavier side, and after I found out my dad was cheating on my mom on my 16th birthday (best gift ever) I really turned to food as a coping mechanism. I hit almost 230 pounds at my max, and my self confidence was shot. When I got to college, I decided enough was enough and really started focusing on my fitness and maintaining a healthy diet. However, what started out as a healthy change in lifestyle quickly turned into an obsession. Working out, counting calories, and constantly restricting, I literally started withering away and I was/am scared shitless. I’m a collegiate athlete and I BURN through calories, but I’m still scared to eat. Self-confidence has never been my strong suit, and my body dysmorphia severely skews my self perception. I just want to have a healthy relationship with food again and I want to be able to look in a mirror and be happy with the person in front of me. The only person I feel I can talk to is my older sister, who also struggled with an ED, so being at school can feel really isolated, even with all my great friends around.

I’ve always had a terrible relationship with food due to my upbringing. I starve myself when I’m sad etc and basically use food as a method of emotional control. I sometimes have food binging episodes too as a method of emotional control (starvation or binging depends on the type of stress). I’ve always been terribly skinny and the people I was surrounded gave me a hard time for it.


I have terrible self image, and one of the things I learnt to embrace is being very skinny. Men seem to love how skinny I am. I grew to equate being skinny to looking good.


Last week I looked in the mirror after having just eaten and looked bloated. Couldn’t see my ribs, and my stomach wasn’t as flat as usual. I decided to skip dinner then quickly realized how wrong what I’m doing was and ate something. Yesterday a man told me I’ve been gaining weight (he was complimenting me) but ever since I’ve been disgusted with my weight. It’s been almost 24 hours since I’ve last eaten and I don’t plan to eat anytime soon. I need to take pain killers because I have a strained neck but I can’t take them without eating first and I just cannot bring myself to do it.

I honestly don’t really know much about AN, but for the majority of my life I’ve been skinny as a rail. It didn’t really bother up through middle school, but then puberty smacked me over the head with a brick and decided that I would grow from about 5’4, to 6 feet flat in 6 months during 7th grade. And pretty much all through high school I hovered at a weight that was somehow considered by my doctors to be ok,  sophomore year I started to develop self image issues that I didn’t even realize I had until very recently when I did a lot of self reflection. If I’m being completely honest, I’m not even sure if what was going on with me really qualifies to be on here, because I would eat and eat, but could never gain weight no matter how hard I tried. When I talked with my parents about, they would say the exact same things every time, “it’ll come you just have to wait until you are older.” Like I would magically put on 50 lbs when I hit my twenties. But somewhere along the line I think I just gave up. I would start thinking that it’s not even worth trying to eat full, regular meals if nothing would come of it. I became seriously depressed and isolated my senior year of high school, which seeped into my first year of college. I hit rock bottom there. I became so fearful of the people I knew, and people I could possibly get to know; that they would look down on me because I was the skinniest guy in the room. 

I remember the exact moment that broke me. It started as one of the best nights I’d had in a long time. Met a girl the weekend before, somehow found the courage to ask if she wanted to get a drink at a bar downtown with some of our mutual friends. We all piled into an Uber and, since there wasn’t enough room for all of us she sat in my lap, and the first thing she said was, “I don’t want to crush you, your legs are so skinny.” I could barely look at her the rest of the night.

My first strategy that actually worked for a while was just asking her once in a while ""what did ya have for lunch?"" or ""did ya have three good meals?"" 

This seemed to work, and she hit a record weight, the only problem being she weighed herself, which I know isn't a helpful solution I think.
 
Ever since she weighed herself she dropped again because she developed bulimic habits. She black out after she eats and isn't able to remember or control her purging. She also has anxiety attacks if she doesn't purge. I know this isn't the Bulimia sub, but you guy are really helpful and responsive.

I suggested starting a voice memo before she eats to keep track of the times she purged, and to start recognizing the signs, and also to try and have her meals with other people around. This is new to me, Bulimia, it's a whole new realm that I'm not familiar with so I'm really feeling around for some solutions.

My main questions: are there any flaws in our strategies here, anything I can do more to help with her? Anything thats more problematic than helpful?

I just want to see her healthy and happy and willing to fight this with her every step by any means necessary, so if you have any suggestions I would be so so so grateful.

I knew I'd been eating less but hadnt really been paying attention. If I had to guess I'd have thought I only lost maybe 5lbs but I hooked with someone last night and finally got a look at my body. 
My ex gets mad at me a lot. Shes always asking how I just forget to eat. How can I go days without eating or craving food. It's not a body image issue but years of therapy have me now understanding it is indeed an eating disorder.
Apparently people without eating disorders dont just forget about food.
I love to run, but I have to be very careful about my workout routine because I can, and have easily dropped into the 80lbs range.
It's got me wondering, I didnt have unlimited access to food as a child. Could my home life in adolescence have affected my eating habits as an adult?
I have always been skinny. I was in no was denied food. But my mom was a health nut. We didnt usually get breakfasts. All vegetarian and low carb lunches and our dinners were also very health concious aswell. We were not allowed to snack at home and we didnt have unlimited access to the fridge or pantry. However we were provided with enough healthy meals, that, during mealtimes we could eat as many servings as we wanted. 
In high school after all my siblings had died or left and I was old enough to hold a job I was expected to provide my own food with the rule that it's be healthy. If I bought mac and cheese boxes or something I'd have to hide it in my room or it'd get tossed. I wanted to spend my money on other things so food got put on the back burner. I would steal food from Duncan doughnuts or Panera bread dumpsters and hide it under my bed. I maybe ate one or 2 bagels a day my senior year of high school.
I had a meal allotment to the cafeteria in college but my parents stopped it after one semester because I used it maybe every other day. I was almost denied access to the military because my minimum weight requirement was 112 and I couldn't get above 100. My recruiter bought me a 30pack of beer a week and tubs of weight gainer. My ex would tell me the extra weight looked good on me. Coincidently earlier that summer I had guy tell me that he liked me but wished I'd gain some weight because he ""didnt want to fuck a skeleton.""

Today we chatted again and after a time talking she told me, she wasn't well at all. After eating lunch with some friends she was angry about her self afterwards, that she was eating at all.

She told me she doesn't want to even try continuing with eating or getting back to a normal eating behavior.
Weeks, even days back she was much more motivated to eat and get better and healthier, but it all went away so quickly...


She doesn't have a therapist, because her parents won't allow her to have one. She doesn't want to go to a clinic, even though this plan would work from the parental side, but it is understandibly scary for her to attend to one.

Her parents aren't very helpful, because they only force her to eat rather then helping her more effectively.

Basically, my best friend suffers from an ED (mainly AN but has other traits as well). It's really difficult to see her going through it and I want to do anything in my power to help her. The problem is, I don't know what to do.

The main problem is that we don't live in the same country. In terms of helping its mostly through texting and skypecalls. I've read up plenty on the disorder itself and recovery processes. I know there isn't any actual solution, but to the recoverees amongst (I'm very proud of you all, you've done amazingly ❤️), what are some things people have done to help you that had a positive effect on you?

3407,bubtigharv,1580454236,ewkjt8,I’m 25 now and my anorexia started when I was 17. My dad put me on a diet that first made me anorexic he would control what I ate and could only eat what he told me till I got obsessed and he encouraged it I was never enough for him in anyway he was mentally and physically abusive my whole life. I was also always with him I was a competitive tennis player for 15 years. I feel like I wasted so much of my life because of anorexia and PTSD and other mental health. I was very underweight last winter but got back to a healthy weight because of how close I was with my mom and hated seeing her cry (we were like best friends) as well as having to already put off so many semesters of school. Since then I still haven’t been able to do another semester my mom doesn’t understand any of my mental illnesses and after going to some therapy it made me realize how much I blame my mom from not protecting me and my brother from my dad or even making things worse as well as she doesn’t support my anorexia or mental heath like she should she tries but at this point our relationship has just gotten bad. I moved out in the summer and cut my dad out of my life. My mom has been helping me financially. Since the summer my relationship has just been getting worse and worse with her. I told her more then once and even texted her exactly how I feel and felt about what she’s done or does but she doesn’t get it. I used to have so many friends too especially from college but my anorexia and everything else has scared them away so I I’m at the point where I have no support system other then my therapists which haven’t helped (need to find new ones) I just feel like I have nothing to live for anymore I missed so many semesters of school don’t have my mom anymore to talk to which I would tell her everything and no friends. I’ve dealt with so much and keep going on but nothing gets better. I don’t even see myself having a future at this point when in least in the beginning of my my last relapse I did I still had dreams and goals. Don’t care about those or anything anymore at this point Idk what to do my depression is so bad and I just break down and have no one to turn to I feel alone and to be honest I don’t care if my anorexia kills me this time I’ve struggled with everything not just anorexia I can never catch a break for to long not even on the right meds right now just found another new psychiatrist after about 100.

This led me to gain 15 pounds. I hated myself for that.
I then tried to lose the weight naturally this year after coming home to the countryside, working out a bit and lowering my calories and that worked. I lost at most 10 pounds but didn't keep it off. My stress went up like crazy because of school and relationships and the gained back 5 of those pounds.
Awhile ago I tested to see if I could make myself throw up, and now I've perfected the technique. It feels totally normal now. These past few days I've been purging 1-3 times a day. BUT my mom has noticed which is a pain (countryside is really quiet), she even asked me about it (I ofc lied) so now I need another option. I know whenever I eat I want to binge because I haven't felt hungry the same way for the past year and a half (no idea why) and I just can't tell when I'm full unless I'm stuffed.
So, I'm going to see if I have the willpower to restrict because I love the feeling of being empty but my mind sometimes just forces me to pick up the nearest bag of chips and once I start, I don't stop until my belly feels bigger. It doesn't help that I'm stuck at home all the time, boredom = eating.

I was however maintaining that weight and did for a year after. Then I met my boyfriend. And I was and still am happy. It's true what they say, you gain weight when you get in a relationship. At first I didn't think anything of the slight weight I've gained. I figured it would come off in time. Then dental issues hit and finances became rough. So I had to leave the gym. I had anxiety about it because I feared the weight returning. Fast forward to today. A year and a half later. And 60 pounds gained. I feel awful. I feel embarrassed to be seen in public. I feel all people see when they look at me is the weight I've gained all over. I've tried exercising, but I kept getting sick when I did. I try to eat healthy and avoid the bad foods, but I'll admit on weekends I binge more than I should. There is a bjj gym I've visited and liked. I haven't been eating much, but nothing has been happening. I think what would work is haulting eating for the time being, and working out as best I can.

ive heard a lot of overweight-obese people diagnose themselves with anorexia because they compensate for binges or restrict to the degree a dieter would tend to do for their health out of guilt instead of care for their own well being. this is very disordered and their weight has no impact on whether or not they have a problem or deserve help for it, i completely think they should seek treatment because all forms of disordered eating are destructive and will take so so much joy from your life. 

i honestly should not care whether someone is claiming to have something they dont fit the criteria for and refuse to see a doctor about because it doesnt actually affect me in any way, but it makes me feel so disgusting. it feels like a bit of a slap in the face when people act like simply eating less and going under your tdee for a couple days will start killing you. idk why i really get so hung up on this because i know its not healthy to have any kind of disordered behavior but it just makes me feel icky that anorexia is thrown around so lightly like it wont given enough time take over your entire life and consume your personality and *actually* kill you and people are just saying oh my anorexia isnt even making me lose weight.",improper self diagnosis?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f2l4fx/improper_self_diagnosis/,1581501561.0,2020-02-11 21:59:21

3453,sunshinehealing,1581396964,f23eyk,"sometimes i feel like im making it all up in my head, like i want attention from it. and then sometimes i see the 104lbs on the scale and think “that’s too much.” and i look in the mirror at this one spot on my body that looks so fucking fat all the time- this one part that sticks out more than the rest on my stomach right below my belly button thats why i dont let anyone touch my stomach because i dont want them to feel it and that i just want to cut it off and have that perfect hourglass shape when i only eat an apple a day. i know im not fat. i know that 104 is not enough, but i think ive trained myself these past few months to feel horrible after eating a huge meal that i wont eat the next 3 meals after it. big dinner? (big as in half a bowl of pasta that gives me cramps because im not used to eating that much) im only eating a banana the next day. some days i wake up and i LOVE how my body looks, so i dont put anything into it that will change that glorified, thin image of myself. i used to get so much praise for it “you’re so skinny omg im jealous!” “how are you so skinny its unfair” “skinny minnyyy!!” and that makes me feel really good cuz i know its what people, and myself, like to see. i miss my butt and my strong legs and the ability to exercise without fainting, but every time i binge, it backfires and i feel even worse than before because i know that if i eat it wont go to my butt or my legs to make me stronger, its just going to that one spot that my eyes seem to focus on every damn time and i hate it. i hate that spot because it makes me not want to eat and i hate that when i dont eat, i love how i look.

my mom and dad started to notice (after telling my mom a few months ago) when i would make food and have this amazing plate in front of me that took an hour to cook but then it just sits there and i distract myself so the hunger goes away and then i wont have to think about food. “from the side it looks like theres nothing even there” “you’re skin and bones little love! we gotta fatten you up!”I FUCKING HATE THAT!!!!!!!!!! dont say “good girl” mockingly when i finish my plate of food because it makes it seem like im a fucking dog. and the words “fatten you up” make me want to never touch food ever again i HATE IT.

i dont think any of my friends really know the full extent of whats going on because i talk about food and eat enough around them that why would they think somethings wrong? they dont see me at home when im laying in bed so fucking hungry, but i go downstairs to get a glass of milk because thats a good substitute for dinner right? they dont see when i fainted in the pub after not eating all day and now have a scar on my face that reminds me every day of it they dont see me when i go to the fridge because im hungry but then think about what that will do to my body so i distract myself, give up, and close it.

but i cant change it.

i dont know how to without feeling the middle section between fat and thin that makes me look and feel so gross. for all my life ive sucked in my stomach, when it started from me just wanting to look skinny, to my muscle memory of never fulling letting my stomach out

i know its said that people with anorexia wear baggy clothes so people dont see whats underneath, which in some cases is true because i rlly only wear sweatpants and sweatshirts. but its the skin tight tank tops underneath that make me feel really confident. when i wear skinny clothes i get compliments and that fuels my need to stop eating and to maintaining looking skinny because if i ever gain weight people will notice and i dont want anyone to think im fat. ive been the skinny, athletic girl all my life so i ate everything but when athletics were taken out of the picture, i had to do something to maintaining the skinny, so food became less of a priority. im too lazy to run so i use my lazy attribute to not eat.

i think my misophonia is also a wayfor me to avoid eating. i dont like the sound of others eating so i dont eat with them i dont like the sound of my own chewing so i dont eat myself. being skinny is better than having a panic attack because of mouth noises right? even the fucking sight of someone eating makes me want to leave the room and i always feel like im being a bitch that “just doesnt like the sound of chewing” BUT I CANT FUCKINGSTAND IT I CANT BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS MY LOVED ONES WITHOUT WANTING TO DIE FROM FRUSTRATION AND IRRITATION BECAUSE OF THIS FUCKING DISORDER THAT I DIDNT ASK FOR.

The worst part about being a substance user and an anorexic is that you dont want to eat due to the fear of becoming overweight but you also dont want to eat because of all the sh!t you put into your body suppressing your appetite.

I just hate everything right now but I dont want to stop nicotine or weed, and I can do without the rest but at the same time why stop all that when I look so good this skinny?

Then it became me just being super busy and neglecting to eat, not fully on purpose but also I was okay with it. Over the summer of 2019 I didn’t eat a ton, skipping meals or eating very little when I did. A friend noticed and started checking in with me to make sure I was eating three good meals a day. We did this for two months, before I felt capable to continue on my own. However, I’m a college student, and soon afterwards since no one was around to check, I began neglecting to eat again. This time it was a combo of somewhat on purpose and me just being too anxious to eat. Late last fall I started a medication for anxiety that gave me my appetite back. But, these last two months because of that, I’ve started purposefully restricting my food intake.

I’m not rapidly losing weight, although I am a bit underweight.

3478,Pretty-Odd-Katia,1581281890,f1ezj6,"
I had a binge eating disorder. It was horrible and sickly. I hated myself. I hated my fat. I couldn't control myself. I decided for change. 
So I started seeing early signs of Ana about a year ago but things got extremely serious towards summer and I'd dropped 14kg. It felt so addicting to see the scales get lower everyday, feel the water fill you on an empty stomach- and what was previously an innocent plan to lose weight and get into shape morphed into a full blown eating disorder.
I have an anxiety disorder (where I always feel completely uncontrolled of myself) and choosing not to eat gave me that control in which I became addicted to.
After summer and at my lowest weight, my family and friends grew concerned and I decided I'd just try and maintain it. It worked for a while. I began excercising, eating more, getting into a good shape, received compliments, and for the first time in a long time I actually liked my body (even though I was a underwight). Then Christmas came.
It was like I completely lost control again. I binge ate thousands and thousands of calories. I developed bulimia. I purged everyday, multiple times. I hated it. I tried to get back on track of a reasonable calorie intake, plus exercise. Didn't last long.
Around half way through January, I binged again, and again, and again, until it became an everyday thing. And then I'd purge, but I hated purging so much so I stopped. But I couldn't stop the binging. I gained 4kg in under two weeks which is not at all healthy. I feel like I've entirely lost control again and want to make it stop. Im terrified of getting back into my binge eating disorder and (and I know it's bad to say) I'd rather be anorexic.
I'm so lost and sad and scared. I can't talk to a professional because I'm still a teenager living with my parents, and I can't talk to my parents either because they are the most hateful, selfish and critical people ever.

3494,pink_tm,1581207417,f10dqh,"General TW for ED stuff 


I've had an eating disorder going on 3 years now. It was very bad last year. 
I got better over the summer, then returning to uni everything went downhill. My weights been up and down, I was in a binge restrict cycle. 
Long story short, the past few weeks, I've found myself going to the gym here and there. Mostly after a binge, or when I was feeling anxious. My use of laxatives, which was never a thing, has increased ( although i dont think it's really bad, just after binges), twice in the past week ( but I dont really intend on using them frequently!) And I've purged a few times over the last couple of weeks ( again, not that bad, infrequent). 
However, I've gone to the gym every day this week. I've found myself stressed out planning when to go, fitting it in between my classes. We had a snow day yesterday, gym was closed and I freaked out. I went today, for my usual time (just 45 min) came home, and have been obsessing about going back to the gym tomorrow. I even had to do some home workout stuff to relieve this weird anxiety over ""not doing enough"". I binged yesterday (got drunk for the first time in ages), and I'm just terrified right now. Because I'm nowhere near how bad I was last year. But this absolute panic over exercise is scaring me a little bit. Today I went to get pre workout, cause I'm tired all the time. My session was really good, but then I found out that my pre workout has some mineral whatever that supposedly causes water retention and I PANICKED. 
I dont knos what this post was for, except that I'm afraid. But it also isnt that bad, because I'm not bad as I was? So everything is fine? But it's really, really not and it's only been two weeks and I honestly have no idea how to stop this exercise. I feel the need to increase, at least on weekends, because ""I have the time for it, so i should be at the gym"" 
I'm going home for 3 days this upcoming weekend, and I'm literally already panicking over the idea of not being able to go to the gym for 3 days. 
Coupled with heavy restriction, but that's a given, it's like this is my new focus. I just dont know what to do. M dietican obviously told me to cut this shit out, but I cant. And I'm only realizing it now.i thought I was choosing to go to the gym. It's only when it was closed yesterday that I realized I'm not the one controlling this. 
And I'm terrified of gaining weight by muscle or whatever. I'm just so afraid that I'm slowing everything down but I'm still compelled to go to the gym. It's insane.

Long story short, me and my boyfriend are together for 2,5 years, and before that we were best friends (well, we still are). When we were about 6 months in the relationship we both had some nasty shit going on in our lives and broke up (I was the one who left, but he seemed kinda relieved), and he met a girl during this time. She is pretty, modelesque and tall, has a nice personality, too, so I don’t blame him for developing some sort of a crush on her. 3 weeks later we both realized we fucked up and started working on our relationship again. Then this girl developed anorexia, and it was a pretty severe case (she had a BMI of 13 and had to go inpatient). Now, I know she got better, but not sure about full recovery, since he doesn’t talk to her anymore. I sometimes creep on her social media, and she still looks very thin. 

I’ve struggled disordered eating for 6 years now, but with a BMI of 17 (5’3”, 96 lbs)I feel like a FUCKING GIANT compared to her. It doesn’t help that I’m, like, 6 inches lower than her, either. Even though my boyfriend absolutely loves my body and says I’m the skinniest and most beautiful girl, it sounds like the most stupid fucking joke just because of how untrue it is.

3520,Kitty91998,1581047040,f04p6p,"The last thing I wanted was for it to get to this point. I am so disappointed in myself and how much I have allowed anorexia to take from me. I know that I need to do this, for me. I need to do this before anorexia takes the last thing it can from me-my life. 

Although, I essentially made this decision after anorexia took my beloved boyfriend from me the other day. He feels helpless, because he has tried to do everything he can to help with no success. He said he did not truly want to break up because he loves the connection we have, but breaks don’t work-and he needs time away from me and this, as his inability o help has began to affect his self-esteem. 

I am heartbroken and ashamed that I affected someone I love so dearly this immensely. He has cared so much. He was going to make a decision (whether or not he is breaking up with me) and talk to me later this week, but I think I made it for him. I told him that I am doing what is best for the both of us (checking myself into treatment) for he needs time to himself, and I need to get better. That if it is meant to be, we will reconnect when I get out. That I hope this isn’t goodbye, and I love him. 

He responded, “I love you too and I hope this isn’t goodbye either” 

I wrote him a letter, and decided that I wanted to wait a little to send it, as I think he just needs time right now even though his response seemed positive. I was originally supposed to go tomorrow, but due to insurance complications it may not be until the end of next week. I am scared, but I also know I am not legally obligated and the length of my stay is up to me, which makes me feel a lot more comfortable. Although the doctor did tell me today that since my eating disorder is so severe, if I don’t respond to treatment in the first 30 days that they would have to transfer me to a hospital. 

Anyway. I was reading the letter to myself while I was simultaneously playing “carry you” by nova amor in the background. I randomly decided to record my letter with the song in the background, and was actually rather pleased with how it came out. Of course, the sound quality is crappy. If you actually read this far, I wanted to ask for some advice. I am going to send him the letter while in treatment, but should I also write the link to the recording? Is it too cheesy? Too much? Don’t be too harsh, as I’m a bit fragile right now :) I’m just a little self conscious that it’ll be too much with everything going on and would appreciate some opinions. Although, it comes from the most genuine place-and I am thinking about sending it to him in hopes that the sincerity will be conveyed.

3530,Onewholemess,1582178918,f6oqyv,"TL;DR: went to see more professionals and getting different answers and conflicting whether I have an actual issue or not. 


I went to see my doctor yesterday. At first I felt so fucking stupid. She knew why I came in, that I was having restrictive eating behaviors and having a lot of trouble with it. So, she started asking about other aspects of anorexia to see if I had those as well. “Did you lose your period? Are you over exercising? Have you tried to purge?” To name a few. To most of her questions I answered no. I felt like a fucking joke. If I don’t have more behaviors such as those, how can I even classify this as an issue? Why was I wasting her time with my bullshit? And then, after the questions, she started to talk. She gave me a 20 minute lecture on how I was going to fuck up my body and natural state and health for the rest of my life if I continued on this track. She told me that she wanted me to start eating triple the amount I am now, and that she didn’t want me to lose anymore weight. All of this took me by surprise, as I’m not underweight. Quite the contrary, I JUST got down into a “healthy weight” BMI. She also wants me to meet with a psychiatrist, and a dietitian. I’ve only been bad for about two months now, I don’t understand. I’m not suffering from many physical side effects of losing too much weight because I haven’t yet. The only thing I’m doing is eating very little every day. I don’t understand. I feel like I have no issue at all, that I’m full of shit, but also like this is a real issue. I’m being compliant with all my doctor says to do, so that’s something I guess. She should get back to me with my blood results. If there’s nothing wrong with my blood I feel like I’ll be crushed. If there are no physical damages, then there’s no issue.

3541,ativanskank,1582126196,f6c98b,"first of all, i am living proof that men can suffer from eating disorders. 

i have always struggled with my weight. when i was in elementary/middle school i was overweight. in the beginning of high school i started to lose weight pretty naturally and healthily and it got me down to a pretty normal weight for someone of my height. 

my ed didn’t really start until i met my ex though. he was a lot skinnier than me and it made me really self conscious. so i started restricting. and then i went down the shore with him for mdw last year and i met his cousin, who at the time had just started treatment for her anorexia. she was severely underweight. and as fucked up as it sounds, seeing her inspired me in a way. it was like, “i could be that thin”. and so i just stopped eating. i ate occasionally, but it was always small portions and usually a liquid of some sort. i got severely underweight towards the end of the relationship. and then i went to an outpatient program (for other reasons) and the doctor took me off my adhd medication. 

after that i started gaining a lot of my weight back. and i think i was just too depressed and too hungry from all the time spent not eating that i couldn’t stop myself from eating. 

but within the last couple months i saw my weight starting to get a lot higher than i wanted it to be and started restricting again. and recently i’ve been eating less and less. 

it’s so hard for me (and i assume others as well) because unlike certain psychiatric disorders like depression, you’re not always sure if you want to “recover” from your eating disorder. i don’t know if i should seek treatment for it or let it happen. because deep down i want to be thin, and i know seeking treatment would prevent that. 

i’m just so conflicted and i don’t know what to do.",my ~story~,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f6c98b/my_story/,1582147796.0,2020-02-19 09:29:56

3549,Kitty91998,1582071149,f61pae,"I view much of this illness as an addiction. What sucks is unlike some other addictions (let’s say...porn addiction) and *alike* drug addiction, people can tell when you’ve been restricting within a matter of days, just as people who have been using again. They can tell even without you losing weight-the sunken face. The bags under your eyes. The slow movements. The slurred and quiet speech. The paleness. You can try and use all the makeup you want to cover up those dark circles...doesn’t work. Never worked for me. Well I can’t afford expensive makeup, lol. I can go only 24-48 without eating and I already look and seem dead again. All it takes is a few days of consistently eating and you can always see the color coming back to my face. 

I think you probably have to be recovered for a long time in order for the effects to not be so prominent within a matter of days. It’s not like you can say, “I haven’t watched porn in a few days” and have people believe you because there is no evidence that they’re lying (unless you have access to their technology). 

You just can’t lie to people. I mean, you can, but if they know you well it’s difficult. They’ll probably know.

It started almost a year ago, maybe more than i year not really sure but i remember my dad commenting about my belly and stuff, I wasn't really fat but i didn't exercise at that time so belly fat happened, i didn't really care at that time but as the comments kept going through my ears i became more aware of my appearance, so i stopped snacking and ate less carbohydrates than i used to, but as the time went by i started hating my body, i started restricting my calorie intake, and i would feel so much safer if i passed a day without eating, and when food gets involved in anything i would start panicking and feel so uncomfortable, got to the point where i obsess over food 24/7, i literally think about it every single minute of the day, counting calories and all that, i didn't really have a certain number of calories tho, i would just try to eat as close to nothing as i can, i started lying about having eaten, i get scared when I'm in a situation where i have to eat in public, or eat in general really, a piece of cake would count as a binge for me and i would start bawling my eyes out right after i finish it, i would over exercise just to feel safe, i would walk as fast as i can to burn more, almost every kind of food is dangerous for me now, only water, coffee, gum and oranges are safe for me and when i eat something else i feel depressed the rest of the day, although i haven't lost a lot of weight, i still look pretty normal and a litte healthy, but my eating behaviors are very questionable, i mean, i don't think it's normal to panic whenever i have to eat, if i am suffering from an undiagnosed eating disorder *which I'm trying to believe isn't true* i hope i find recovery as fast as possible, and i hope everyone who's struggling to get the needed help soon

3582,kaliedoscoping,1581896667,f4zhn7,"Let me preface this by saying I’ve been somewhere around 5 lbs overweight my whole life; I’ve never had anything but a normal relationship with food up until a year ago (I don’t even like sweets, have never binged — I just miss eating meals!). My last relationship was 2.5 years long, and I (F20) was his (M24) first girlfriend ever. We met online and I don’t think he realizes to this day the extent of body image issues the things he said to me gave me. He would tell me things like he thought I was pretty, but would be so much hotter if I’d just tone my stomach; our roommate (who looks a lot like me but was always smaller than I was) was hotter; 1.5 years in he told me at the start of the relationship he’d never been attracted to me and I had to “grow on him” in terms of looks. He was a bit overweight always and always struggled with fad diets; he would do keto and starve himself for a week only to binge on a whole bag of chocolates randomly, etc and living together it really rubbed off on me. I developed pretty severe anorexia last year and am now somewhere between moderately and severely underweight. We broke up in December and I moved back in with my parents to try to save up money. 

The thing is, I’ve been insecure my whole life, but having a partner or best friend tell me I was hot always made me feel okay and confident. I feel like if I had someone to reassure me I wouldn’t be struggling so hard, if I woke up tomorrow and had a bf or bff who genuinely thought I was hot at whatever weight (within reason) I feel like I could just snap out of this, snap out of the calorie counting, fasting, obsessive exercise, I could just stop all of it and be “normal.” But I don’t have anyone. My abusive relationship took away everyone from me and I’m struggling so hard to meet and date because I’m 1) living with my parents but also 2) just so insecure right now. My online friends are so supportive but sometimes a gal just needs some sexual/romantic reassurance! It’s so freaking hard to try to recover on my own. I almost feel like I need to stay tiny until I meet someone and show them I *can* be tiny and hot before I feel comfortable enough to “let myself go.” I got invisaligns recently and they’re making it so much harder too.

So I brought my crockpot into my bathroom (I have my own bathroom in my room that I pay extra for) and it’s a literal disgusting MESS right now. Please don’t judge. I mean, you can. I don’t care about strangers judging though. Like it’s bad...eggshells on the floor and in the sink, small pieces of broccoli in the sink...have I washed my hands in the past week? No. I’ve been severely depressed. It’s been the worst past two weeks of my life. Anyway. So my roommate has her boyfriend and her friend from work over...it’s 4am in the morning and they JUST went to sleep recently and stopped being so loud and obnoxious. I’m still up. I see my door start to open. Her friend comes in and I immediately sprint up and I’m like “my bathroom is a literal mess right now...like it’s not usable”. He just nods his head and proceeds to use my bathroom. Now he’s probably going to tell my roommates and I’m going to absolutely die from shame and embarrassment. I never want to eat again now. There was literally another bathroom in the hall. If someone was using it, you could have waited.

3659,NoCreativeInput,1582664475,f9h4ir,"Jan 24, 1:15pm

I just weighed myself and weigh **0.7. Two days ago I was **1.7

I looked at my weight loss tracking app.
I saw that my weight loss has been .29% per week since December 3 2019. 3 pound weight loss in almost 3 months.

I stepped back from the scale and said aloud to myself  as I was picking up quarters ($3.50 to be exact) to go to do laundry in my near empty apartment where my girlfriend sleeps soundly in the next room.  

I said aloud:
“ I am more than that. I am intelligent. I know words. I am compassionate, I am beautiful because I have freckles on my beautiful brown skin.”  

 I started to tear up when unconsciously I said words in which I don’t believe “ I am more than that number on that scale. I am worthy of love. Of receiving it. Of Giving it.” A voice that spoke words as if they didn’t come from me lovingly cascaded out of my mouth because I don’t believe them. But this was a gentle reminder, or rather affirmation from deep within. A truth I push away where instead the lie that I am “fat” beats me over the head daily and rips me apart, tearing my self-esteem and any possibility of self-love away and out of my grip.

So. I am more.

I am more than the names that I was called thought elementary school and the nickname they gave me about my body. The name that the popular girls at the sleepovers branded me with at the parties I used to get invited to. I am more than the hurt that still haunts me from the boy that told me he’s “seen uglier” when I was 11 at a party in a hot tub when it was time to play “who would you date” I am more than the trauma that began when the boy who told me to “sit down Rilen, nobody wants to see your fat” when my pre-pubesent, lanky, tall 5’5, size 6 body rose from my desk and I outstretched my arms above my head to simply stretch and my favorite magenta shirt rolled up, betraying me by exposing my then, non-existent “muffin top. I am more than the permanent message that from that moment forward that my hips were bad, gross, disgusting and the eventual stretch marks that showed up in adulthood were wrong and something to humiliated about. I am more than that debilitating fear that forces me to wear leotards when I perform out of sheer terror that my shirt might fly up and my “fat stomach” and “hips” will fall out mid performance, leading me to be self-conscious and unable to stay in the moment during a scene because that voice will scream at me how disgusting I am and how embarrassed I should be. 

I am more than the deleterious nickname my mom gave my breasts in high school that mocked  the color of my skin and the shape of my body. Goddamnit, I am MORE than any mean word and slur that anyone believed they had the agency or permission to pass judgment about my childhood body and my body now in my adult years.

I deserve nothing but respect and admiration for my body. For its shape, its color, the ripples on my thighs, the scars on my skin that I self- inflicted because I needed to feel something in moments of distress. The freckles that litter my face that seem to multiply every year, my 3 tattoos on my body inked in by a stinging needle with each holding deep meaning and representing a piece of my identity. 

My mind deserves to be respected for its intellect and capabilities. My gifts to express myself through word, song and acting deserve acknowledgment, not my untoned arms and stomach. My mind needs to accept that I am everything I need to be in this moment. Would I like to lose weight to feel more confident in my body? Yes. Does that mean that because of  weight loss I need to do in order to be healthier that was unfairly added to my body as a side effect of psychiatric meds to help with other aspects of my mental health that debilitate me equal me being gross, a failure and lazy because it hasn’t happened yet?  Does that fear that freezes me from making changes cross my mind that even if I lose weight I will still hate myself as much as I do now? Undoubtedly. But when all is said and done, I am enough. I am all that I need to be. A number on a piece of glass with batteries and a number on a size of pants or shirt has absolutely no merit or any standing in who I am as a human.

3697,samirawifey,1582435096,f853tw,"I started going to therapy once a week after a big relapse and I’m just getting so frustrated with it.

1) My therapist is always asking me what I need or what I think would be helpful to talk about- I DON’T KNOW. If I knew what would help me I wouldn’t be here! If I knew how to recover from this I wouldn’t be hemorrhaging money on treatment! Like I understand that it’s good practice to ask but if I haven’t given a useful answer to this question once in five sessions maybe it’s time to stop asking. I told her as much today in our session.

2) My therapist tried to tell me about “riding the wave” today and I absolutely lost it. I understand how anxiety works. I cope pretty well these days with school and work stress. I know how to breathe and distract myself and make a game plan. I cannot ride the wave on my eating disorder. It is not a moment of panic after eating that will pass- I have to live in my body all the time and just being aware of myself makes me feel like shit. I fundamentally believe that my body is fat and ugly and that for some reason that matters and I have not been able to get rid of that belief in years of previous therapy. My eating disorder is a reaction to the fear that I am ugly and unlovable and that is constant and present. There is no ride the wave. I am drowning in those feelings. The only time I am not hyper aware of my own body is when I’m at work busy with other people, and I come home exhausted. The tracking, the weigh ins- if I don’t do them, the fear becomes so intense that I eat almost nothing and would pull a literal narcissus permanently body-checking myself in any reflective surface.

My therapist asked me how I knew I was ugly since I had expressed strong body dysmorphia. I honestly hadn’t thought about it in depth before but then I realized how I knew- people interact with me like an ugly girl, and they always have. Boys do not like me. Pretty girls do not befriend me. Creepy guys behave normally around me. There’s more but I’m sure y’all know what I’m talking about- people treat conventionally attractive women a certain way, for better or for worse, and I have not been treated that way. And it’s stupid! I don’t think other people should base their self worth on attractiveness. I don’t even want attention from men- I’m gay! And I don’t even really want attention from random women- I’m happily taken! But for some reason being appraised as pretty is desperately important to me, and the fact that I’m not remains deeply painful.

So I don’t know what to do. I do feel like I understand my disorder a little better since starting therapy, but I do not feel like that information is giving me the power to change any of my behaviors. My therapist keeps trying to separate the ED from me, and I get that, but also anorexia is ego-syntonic. It all feels like me. It all is me. It’s my brain and my body and it wants to be thin more than it wants to recover.",Therapy vent post,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f853tw/therapy_vent_post/,1582456696.0,2020-02-22 23:18:16

I don’t know if I should be open about my own personal history with patients, though I know many psychiatrists are.

3712,asthecrowruns,1582384171,f7tpme,"I’m new to this subreddit, so I apologise if this isn’t appropriate or I say something wrong, but I just need some clarification on something. 

I’m overweight, and although last year I lost a decent amount, I still have a bit more to lose to get into a healthy weight range. I lost my weight pretty healthily the first time - I didn’t fall into bad habits. I gained a small amount at Christmas, and needing to lose the rest, I recently decided to go back to my dieting. 

This second time though, I’m starting to struggle with guilt and obsession over my calories. Not just counting like I used to, but restricting beyond the point of healthy. I feel pretty guilty about it because I know it’s wrong, yet part of my doesn’t want to stop. My last weight loss was healthy but slow, so the impatient part of me wants to restrict more to loose it quicker, and doesn’t find it a problem because I’m still overweight (so dropping a large amount wouldn’t be overly detrimental). 

Aside from the restriction, my appearance and weight is all that’s on my mind and I can’t stop feeling proud of feeling hungry (because then I can eat). The weight is already coming off too - I have no incentive to stop because I’m eating pretty low but still a lot compared to many ED sufferers I’ve seen, so I don’t even know if it’s a problem

Is this really problematic, and if so, how can I stop this spiralling out of control?

(I don’t have any medical access for another four months either, so I can’t speak to a professional.

3716,likeaschoolgirl,1582344498,f7nbc5,"I’ve been in recovery for 9 years, and my relapses have been far and few between. I’ve been pretty good at handling triggers, but I was with my roommate and her friends earlier and one friend started talking about wanting to lose weight and saying some triggering shit. “It’s not body image... I’m working out and I just am not seeing the results I want... I need a calorie deficit in order to lose weight... I wouldn’t be underweight...”

I argued with her for a few minutes. I could tell she was flustered and defensive and my roommate was defending her saying “I understand it’s a fitness goal” while I was saying, you don’t need to lose weight, there’s no need to, you shouldn’t have to, you’re healthy and exercise plenty, if you’re not losing weight then your body doesn’t want you to, etc. 

Then she goes, “I don’t think it’s bad to count calories... I mean, calories matter a lot and they’re important to pay attention to.”

That’s when I lost my shit. I literally stood up and went back to my room and had to take deep breaths just to calm myself down because I was legitimately on the brink of panic for a second, and not gonna lie, I shed some tears. More frustration than anything, I think. I know it’s not true, and she’s an idiotic 20 year old girl. It angered me almost that she made a statement like that. I still have a visceral reaction to it. I don’t want or plan to relapse at all, and it didn’t even upset my body image, yet it just... triggered something in me. You know?

I didn’t think that this far along in recovery I would still experience these reactions. I didn’t think I would get triggered like that. I guess recovery is a lifelong journey. I’m much better and less sensitive than I used to be, but someone literally claiming that “calories matter” especially in the context of wanting to lose weight for literally no good reason - she couldn’t offer a single answer when I asked what the benefit of losing weight would be - was just too much for me to handle.

I feeeeeeellllll awfuuuullll!!!! 

Like I’m no longer a good anorexic and I’m also not able to work or be a productive member of society and I feel like a shitbag. 

I swear I gained like 8 lbs in less than 2 weeks. I’m eating so much on the weight gain meal plan and I feel like a failure because I didn’t get to my goal weight before I started IP and now I’ve almost got to my low end whereas other patients have taken weeks and weeks and weeks to get there (like some are doing week 13/14 of treatment and are just getting to their low end).

I feel lost am disgusted in my body. I feel like I have nothing to control now. I do want treatment, even though it might sound different, but I’m just struggling with the physical changes.

I’m hoping the rapid weight gain (like so fast) is partly poop weight because my GI system is messed, and hopefully part water weight because even though I haven’t had a period in over a year, I still get the cramps and sore breasts and just this dark brown spotting/discharge, and I’m thinking my body is still trying to retain some water even without an actual period.

My cousin (17F) is like my younger sister. I have 2 siblings and she has none so I’ve taken the older sister type of role in her life, and she tells me everything. I was the first person she came out to and that means a lot to me. I love her with all my heart and I don’t know how to help her.

A couple months ago she was diagnosed with anorexia, but I knew atleast a month or 2 before something was wrong. She barely ate, which wasn’t like her as we’re both big eaters. She was loosing a lot of weight, often looked sick, and was tweeting on her ‘spam’ twitter about how she was fainting all the time. I reached out to her and she had told me she was struggling, so I went with my aunt and her to see a doctor. 

She was getting better, until recently. I’m not sure what happened, she got into all the universities she loved, got a girlfriend, got a job, but just crashed. She’s eating less and less, constantly comparing herself to others, and fainting so much that she has bruises. She said she doesn’t even see a point in recovering anymore. Nothing I seem to do or say can help, and it really fucking breaks my heart seeing it.

3750,sacredpeanutwolf,1583389745,fdr6ml,"*trigger warning* for a long time I’ve speculated that my sister is anorexic. She’s 14 and has a BMI of 18 (border line underweight). Her habits and her body just scream at me “anorexic”.  I have said this to my mother, who dismisses it. Today after what looked like a day with out eating, I decided to try something new. I logged into her Snapchat. Among all of her private stories, was one named “rants”. She has not allowed anyone to view it. But since I’m on her account... I open up the story and it says quote
 “you’re fat! You eat too much. Sometimes I just wish you’d give up. Don’t eat anymore. You’ll be happier. Hungrier. But happier” 

I know she was talking about herself from previous context clues. Then she goes on to say in the next slide

 “I’m disgusted in you. Why couldn’t you just not eat. Why’d you have to make all these bad decisions all the time. You wanna be skinny but you’re doing the opposite. You’re just fat. A fat person who can’t control herself, I’m sick to my stomach.” 

That’s all she says. But I am shaking right now. I know where this all stems from. And I know that if I uncover this, our relationship will be ruined. And if she finds out that I did this, which she might, our relationship will be ruined. I am going to keep logging in to her Snapchat to keep checking up on her. But I don’t know what to do, I’m lost, and scared. Do I tell someone? do I talk to her, if so how?

3762,colettevasss,1583271956,fd24a9,"Hello peoplee.
Firstly, I'm going to give a brief background of my story.
I'm a 16yo female and have been suffering from anorexia for the past 3 years. I was hospitalized in August and stayed impatient for 2 months. 
I have been seeing a therapist and I'm supposed to be following a meal plan ever since. However, I don't always stick to my plan, I miss most of my snacks and sometimes I skip breakfast. To be more specific, I've been eating about 1200-1300 cals for the past few months, which has resulted in some weight loss. Even though I fake my weight at my physician appointment, my parents have noticed. They made it clear that if I lose even more they are going to get me to the hospital again. This happened 2 weeks ago, and I have managed to increase my calorie intake to about 1400 cals. (I have been inspired to try the minnie maud recovery method but I'm to scared to do this lol).
I can't talk to my therapist about it. She doesn't know I've been restricting, she thinks I follow the meal plan and is proud of me. However, she has told me I need to gain to get my period back. I consider myself (and I think she does as well) to be a mild case of anorexia, as I was underweight but not that much.(?)

I'm hungry and thinking about food most of the times. I eat large amounts of veggies and stuff but the volume doesn't seem to satisfy me. Today I kind of ""binged"" on 1700, which happened for the first time and now I feel guilty.
I want this to stop, I want to be able to just enjoy food. I know this affects my parents as well, which makes me feel even more guilty.

When I feel stressed out, I restrict to alleviate the feeling of being out of control, much like an addict might drink or take drugs. I guess what I'm saying is that restriction feels (to me) like an unhealthy coping mechanism rather than a symptom of an illness like depression (loss of interest in activities you usually enjoy, for example).

When I lay on my side, I can feel my stomach expand, and my hip fat touching the fat on my sides. That freaks me out. It makes me feel disgusting, and so damn fat. 
When I lay on my back, I get anxious due to having sleep paralysis in the past. But, if my heads not in the right position, I feel like my double chin is choking me. 
When I lay in the position where I’m halfway in between being on my side and being on my belly (you know, the one where one leg is straight and the other is bent?), I can feel the fat rolls on my back. 

No matter how I lay, I can’t sleep because I feel so disgusting. What’s worse, is when my fiancé cuddles with me. His hand goes over my stomach, and I just want to sob. It’s to the point where I’m not sleeping, and because I’m not sleeping I’m upset. So, I’m upset, so I think “why is being skinny even worth it”, cry, and binge. It’s a neverending cycle and I want to end it. I want to stop being this chubby mess but nothing works. I wanna look how I looked two years ago. But because of all the sports I did two years ago, my knees are all kinds of fucked up. So running, or lunges, or squats are all incredibly painful. 
I just feel like I’m never going to be beautiful. I get married in 8 months, and I don’t want people to look at me and see what I see.

Im not fatphobic, I swear, I respect, love and accept fat people, but its different when it's me we're talking about. Im sorry im using the word fat as an insult, I really hate myself for it, specially since I call myself ""body positive"". I know Im hypocrite.

""You look sick"" ""You look anorexic"" ""Have you been eating?""

I am anorexic, I started eating a bit more and people started praising me. 

""You look so healthy""

Who in their right mind gets offended for that? Everyone started mentioning how I look so healthy and how I dont look tired anymore. It makes me hate myself. I know it's stupid but I miss looking ""sick"" or like I havent eaten for days.

now they say im getting fat DUDE CHILL IM FORTY KILOGRAMS WTF. I know im still underweight, but I feel so fucking fat, I hate my thighs the most. But now it was harder to restrict, so I just restricted a little and went back to bulimia beacause IM A FUCKING IDIOT. I hadn't purged in like a month and now im doing it nearly everyday.

Last year I felt this sudden urge to be very skinny. (I’ve always been very thin my whole life, but it wasn’t enough). I skipped a few meals starting out. I was dropping a few pounds a week. It didn’t seem that serious to me at first. One meal turned into two, and two meals turned into three. I would go days without eating a proper meal. I was tiding myself over with cereal bars to make myself think I was eating. In a matter of 2 months I had dropped 30 pounds. I remember my mother seeing me shirtless and almost having a heart attack in the kitchen. She measured my waist with a measuring tape and was horrified. She said It was like you could almost see my organs in my abdominal area. I didn’t understand why she was so upset. I didn’t see what she was seeing. When i looked in the mirror i still didn’t feel skinny enough. As our bodies have to provide energy to keep us alive, other things become less important, like our hair. My hair has always been my pride. When I stopped eating I noticed it thinning out. I started taking finasteride for about 2 weeks (20 days-ish) because I was convinced it was male pattern baldness, and finasteride helps to stop thinning from male pattern. I had libido side effects so I stopped it. I have horrible OCD so I often google side effects and scare myself. I came across the Post Finasteride Syndrome online. It’s when the side effects of Finasteride never go away. It’s been about 8 months since I stopped taking finasteride and I still don’t feel like my sex drive is all there. ED also effects your sex drive though. I am still dealing with my eating disorder. Some of the side effects of post finasteride syndrome are gynocomastea, Which only fuels my ED. I don’t want to grow breasts if I gain weight. My face has hollowed out and my skin is very dry and feels thin, which is also a side effect of Post Finasteride syndrome, but dry skin and a tired face are also a side effect of anorexia. Do you see my dilemma here? Me and my mother have spoken to doctors who say there’s no way I can have lasting side effects from a pill that I took for 20 days. I can’t eat food anymore because I’m scared of weight deposition that’s also a side effect of the syndrome. My skin is ruined and my face looks tired. I’m just scared. Is this all in my head? Do I have some incurable syndrome or have i created this in my head as a means to fuel my eating disorder?

3823,idontcarethrowawayyy,1582828230,faghzm,"in a couple days it will be my birthday. that same day  will be the one year anniversary of leaving residential treatment.
i was 14 when i started starving myself. i was a small kid and honestly never thought i was fat. it was more of a i-hate-myself-and-need-to-show-it type of thing. i started at about 100 lbs (5’4) and by the beginning of my sophomore year was down to about 75. i was depressed to the point of not speaking or getting out of bed. i didn’t care if i lived or died.
my parents sent me inpatient, where i stayed for 6 weeks. i was then sent to residential for 12 weeks.
when i was at the peak of my disorder, i truly believed that the rest of my life would be devoted to anorexia. 
i’m almost 17 now. i’m not cured. i still don’t like my body.
but i think about other things now. my mind has space and energy. i am out of the fog. i don’t get black spots every time i stand up.
i have friends. i have passions. i have a life. 
i’m not yet the peachy success story of the girl who no longer counts calories and loves her body. but things can change. my life is exponentially different now. it’s possible.",it’ll be a year soon,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/faghzm/itll_be_a_year_soon/,1582849830.0,2020-02-27 12:30:30

3826,actuallycatherine,1582822099,faex50,"Recently, I have been going through the first BIG break up of my life, four years to be exact (If you want more info on this I have made several posts the past few days on various subs). After my break up, I have found no motivation to eat food anymore. I know I should eat, I had been healthily eating for a while now and this isn't a good relapse. However, I can't bring myself to eat food. I tried the first day after my break up but everything tasted just wrong in a sense. I don't feel hungry really, yet my stomach hurts. I feel like my mind wants food, my body doesn't need it. People are starting to ask me when was the last time I ate and I know I cannot tell them without them worrying so I have been lying. How do I go about my life with a sense of normality anymore? After my life has been flipped upside down, how do I get to being okay again?",I have been recovering for a long time and this is my first hard relapse.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/faex50/i_have_been_recovering_for_a_long_time_and_this/,1582843699.0,2020-02-27 10:48:19

3831,jokertoker75,1582807677,fablnm,"Hey guys, I’m gonna tell you a little bit about myself. I’m 30 years old I have dealt with anorexia for most if not all of my life. I struggle on a daily basis to attain my goals of normal eating habits and of thinking that being a normal weight is OK. I have done well in the later years of accepting normal eating habits. Although I still struggle from time to time.
About me in short...
I moved from the East Coast to the West Coast to start a food truck (Believe it or not I’m a chef). Well my partner “supposedly”, was not ready and I’ve wasted my time and my money, both things that are very valuable to me. I’m Moving back to North Carolina to have a stable life to have a fighting chance to overcome all of my vices. 
I say this to say that I am stressing out...and this sub has opened me up to so many like me that are going through a constant battle and all we can do is push through and fight back! You are a warrior and you will prevail! 

Peace is a lie there is only passion
Through passion I gain strength
Through strength I gain power 
Through power I gain victory 
Through victory my chains are broken.

Always with love
